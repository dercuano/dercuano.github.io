(21 minutes)</div><p>So I want to write an immediate-mode GUI library (see <a href="../notes/imgui-tk.html">IMGUI programming compared to Tcl/Tk</a>)
for <a href="https://gitlab.com/kragen/bubbleos">this experimental programming system I’m writing</a>.  But I also want
to write a programming language for the purpose, because (see <a href="../notes/yeso-notes.html">Yeso notes</a>) even without the IMGUI library, I’ve written 1500+ lines
of C for graphical applications, and I feel like a more reasonable
programming language would make those applications both significantly
less code and significantly less bug-prone.</p>
<h2>Local-variable pointers and var parameters</h2>
<p>IMGUI is a lot easier when I can take addresses of local variables to
do things like this:</p>
<pre><code>static int item_current_2 = 0;
ImGui::Combo("combo 2 (one-liner)", &amp;item_current_2,
             "aaaa\0bbbb\0cccc\0dddd\0eeee\0\0");
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>item_current_2</code> contains the current selection in the combo
box.  In C, you can also do this with struct fields and whatnot.  This
is a feature that is missing from Lisp-memory-model programming
languages, in general.  You typically end up providing “slot” objects
with a get method and a set method, which is inconvenient if it
involves changing the definition of the thing you’re trying to change,
or writing a special-purpose wrapper.  (Common Lisp took a different
approach.)</p>
<h2>Blocks</h2>
<p>But C makes IMGUI harder when you have to do things like this:</p>
<pre><code>    if (ImGui::BeginMenu("Help"))
    {
        ImGui::MenuItem("Metrics", NULL, &amp;show_app_metrics);
        ImGui::MenuItem("Style Editor", NULL, &amp;show_app_style_editor);
        ImGui::MenuItem("About Dear ImGui", NULL, &amp;show_app_about);
        ImGui::EndMenu();
    }
    ImGui::EndMenuBar();
</code></pre>
<p>In a language like Smalltalk or Ruby with a block facility, you could
write this as follows, avoiding the EndMenu and EndMenuBar calls and
the potential bug of forgetting them:</p>
<pre><code>    ImGui::BeginMenu("Help") {
        ImGui::MenuItem("Metrics", NULL, &amp;show_app_metrics);
        ImGui::MenuItem("Style Editor", NULL, &amp;show_app_style_editor);
        ImGui::MenuItem("About Fear ImGui", NULL, &amp;show_app_about);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Possibly MenuItem would also take a block to specify the action to
take:</p>
<pre><code>    ImGui::BeginMenu("Help") {
        ImGui::MenuItem("Metrics", NULL) { show_app_metrics(); }
        ImGui::MenuItem("Style Editor", NULL) { show_app_style_editor(); }
        ImGui::MenuItem("About Mere ImGui", NULL) { show_app_about(); }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Block arguments can also give you resource managers (with-open-file,
save-excursion) and iteration, all without the garbage-collection
difficulties and compiler complexities of full-fledged closures.  I
feel like iterators implemented with block arguments are somewhat
inferior to first-class sequence objects as in Python and D, but
they’re relatively passable.</p>
<h2>Closures versus var parameters</h2>
<p>In conventional GUI toolkits, a strong argument for first-class
garbage-collected closures is that it allows you to write
event-handling code like the above.  In IMGUI, downward-funarg blocks
are adequate!</p>
<p>Perhaps address arguments (the <code>&amp;item_current_2</code> in the above example)
could be subject to a discipline like Pascal’s downward-funarg
discipline: you can pass an address as an argument or store it in a
local variable, but you can’t store it in a global variable, a
variable in an outer scope, a record field, or an array item, and you
can’t return it.  (Alternatively, storing it into a record or array
would cause the record or array to inherit the downwardness; in this
direction eventually lies Rust.)  This would make it statically safe
to pass addresses of local variables without requiring garbage
collection.  (It’s very roughly equivalent to Algol call-by-name, or to
passing a getter function and a setter function.)</p>
<p>In fact, I had forgotten this, but it turns out that Pascal has
precisely this feature: its “var parameters” are precisely the
downward-only-passable address arguments being described here, except
that you can’t store them in a local variable or reseat them, and
(more disconcertingly to my eye) they look just like input parameters
at the callsite.  Oberon follows Pascal in this, despite having
garbage collection and thus no need for the downward-only discipline.</p>
<h2>Fuck C, though, seriously</h2>
<p>I really hate C’s single program-wide namespace (give me method
namespaces and a module system, please), verbose type syntax, lack of
multiple return values, lack of list comprehensions, lack of any kind
of real error handling, clumsiness with ad-hoc polymorphism,
inflexible argument passing, bug-prone coercions, bug-prone error
reporting, and lack of memory-safety.  (The NULLs in the above code
example are perhaps avoidable in C++, but in C they’d be a consequence
of the inflexible argument passing.)  I like the fact that in C you
can copy records by value and avoid aliasing them, just as I like the
fact that you can alias fields with pointers when you want.</p>
<h2>Types and arguments</h2>
<p>You probably want optional named arguments for IMGUI; record literals
are probably fine for that if you can invoke operations on them, and
of course Tk does it by parsing command lines.  Without those, you’re
stuck with something like a PostScript graphics context to change
things like font sizes and colors.</p>
<p>For pixel slinging, you probably want numeric vector types, at least
fixed-size ones.</p>
<p>I’ve been wondering if you could do most of Hindley-Milner type
inference, including sum types, without any parametric polymorphism,
though perhaps supporting ad-hoc polymorphism.  (I want sum types
primarily to avoid null pointers and secondarily because of the
usefulness of pattern-matching in compiler-like work.)  That is, every
variable and every function would have a fully concrete type, but it
would be inferred from context as much as possible.</p>
<p>I really like the Golang interface construct.  It conflicts to a
minimal extent with the desire for type inference, because if method
calls on concrete types and method calls indirected through interfaces
are written with the same syntax, the most you could ever infer about
a value from the method calls is a lower bound on its interface.</p>
<p>You ought to be able to infer the structure of a sum type from any
wildcardless pattern match that matches on an object of that type.</p>
<p>I don’t have a completely clear idea of how the kind of value
references I’d like to be able to pass to things like <code>ImGui::Combo</code>
above should interact with interfaces and heap pointers.</p>
<h2>Some C code examples and their Platonic essences</h2>
<h3>Yesomunch</h3>
<p>Here is some existing code written with Yeso:</p>
<pre><code>#include "yeso.h"

int main()
{
  ywin w = yw_open("munching squares", 1024, 1024, "");

  for (int t = 0;; t++) {
    ypic fb = yw_frame(w);
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; fb.h; y++) {
      ypix *p = yp_pix(fb, 0, y);
      for (int x = 0; x &lt; fb.w; x++) p[x] = (t &amp; 1023) - ((x ^ y) &amp; 1023);
    }

    yw_flip(w);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is what I would like it to look like:</p>
<pre><code>#include "yeso.h"

int main()
{
  yw_open("munching squares", 1024, 1024, "") for (ywin w) {
    for (int t = 0;; t++) {
      yw_frame(w) for (ypic fb) {
        yp_scanlines(fb) for (int y, ypix *p) {
          for (int x = 0; x &lt; fb.w; x++) p[x] = (t &amp; 1023) - ((x ^ y) &amp; 1023);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>or, with lifetimes or scopes extending from each declaration to an
implicit end at the enclosing <code>}</code>, as in C++, but also including
loops, something like <a href="../notes/raph-io.html">Notes on Raph Levien's "Io" Programming Language</a>:</p>
<pre><code>use yeso

{
  yw_open("munching squares", 1024, 1024, "") -&gt; ywin w;
  for (int t = 0;; t++);
  yw_frame(w) -&gt; ypic fb;
  yp_scanlines(fb) -&gt; int y, ypix *p;
  for (int x = 0; x &lt; fb.w; x++);
  p[x] = (t &amp; 1023) - ((x ^ y) &amp; 1023);
}
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>use yeso

yeso.window("munching squares", 1024, 1024) w:
    (0..) t:
        w.events:
            be it Die: return 0
            be _: None
        w.frame:
            it.each_line y, p:
                (..#p):
                    p[it] &lt;- bitand(t, 1023) - bitand(xor(it, y), 1023)
</code></pre>
<p>This looks very much like Ruby, actually, though with Lobster syntax.
Some improvements over the C version:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s less than half as much code.</li>
<li>Opening and closing the window is taken care of by the yeso.open
   function, which passes the window object to the argument block, and
   implicitly closes the window upon exit from that block.  If you
   call it without a block, it returns the window object, and you have
   to close it explicitly.  Similarly, <code>w.frame</code> flushes the
   framebuffer to the display when the block exits.  This is much less
   bug-prone than the C version.</li>
<li>The options argument in the C version is optional and omitted.</li>
<li>No types are mentioned except <code>Die</code>.</li>
<li>The event dispatch is done with pattern-matching instead of a bunch
   of functions.</li>
<li>Numeric ranges are first-class callable objects; invoked with
   blocks, they iterate.</li>
<li>Parentheses are not needed for function calls without non-block
   arguments; you use some other syntax to get a reference to a method
   when that is necessary.</li>
<li>Bitwise operations are written with function-call syntax rather
   than infix operators.</li>
<li>Mutation <code>&lt;-</code> is distinct from declaration and initialization <code>=</code>.</li>
<li>The length of a slice is extracted with <code>#</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Block syntax is <code>arg1, arg2, arg3: INDENT body OUTDENT</code>, where the
argument list may be empty.  The special identifier <code>it</code>, if mentioned
in the body, is added as an argument to the argument list.</p>
<h3>Tetris piece rotation</h3>
<p>Here’s a function from <a href="https://gitlab.com/kragen/bubbleos/tree/master/yeso/tetris.c">my Tetris implementation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>void rotate_piece(char *piece, char piece_rotated[][4], int piece_r)
{
  int origin, xs, ys;
  switch (piece_r) {
  case 0:
    origin = 0;
    xs = 1;
    ys = 4;
    break;
  case 1:
    origin = 3;
    xs = 4;
    ys = -1;
    break;
  case 2:
    origin = 15;
    xs = -1;
    ys = -4;
    break;
  case 3:
  default:
    origin = 12;
    xs = -4;
    ys = 1;
    break;
  }

  for (int y = 0; y != 4; y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x != 4; x++) {
      piece_rotated[x][y] = (' ' != piece[origin + x*xs + y*ys]);
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This converts a 16-byte piece into a 4×4 array of booleans with a
particular rotation in a pretty crappy way.  Instead:</p>
<pre><code>to rotate_piece(piece, piece_rotated, piece_r):
    (origin, xs, ys) = ((0, 1, 4) if piece_r == 0 else
                        (3, 4, -1) if piece_r == 1 else
                        (15, -1, -4) if piece_r == 2 else
                        (12, -4, 1))
    (..4) y:
        (..4): piece_rotated[it][y] = (' ' != piece[origin + it*xs + y*ys])
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler can here infer that <code>origin</code>, <code>xs</code>, <code>ys</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>it</code>, and
<code>piece_r</code> are ints, that <code>piece_rotated</code> is an array of arrays of
bools, and that <code>piece</code> is an array of chars.  There’s also a tuple of
three ints here.</p>
<p>We can do better, though, if we can return the array of arrays, and
our loop is actually a list comprehension producing that array:</p>
<pre><code>to rotate_piece(piece, piece_r):
    (origin, xs, ys) = ((0, 1, 4) if piece_r == 0 else
                        (3, 4, -1) if piece_r == 1 else
                        (15, -1, -4) if piece_r == 2 else
                        (12, -4, 1))

    (..4) x: (..4) y: ' ' != piece[origin + x*xs + y*ys]
</code></pre>
<p>Can the compiler infer that this returns specifically a 4×4 array
rather than just an array of arrays (of bools)?  If it could infer
that, then the caller could allocate space for the return value on the
stack.  An alternative that doesn’t involve dynamic allocation for
such sequences is to return a generator object, which the caller can
then unpack as they see fit, but that isn’t a good default semantics
for a for loop.</p>
<p>Or we could take a block argument to store the result:</p>
<pre><code>to rotate_piece(piece, piece_r):
    (origin, xs, ys) = ((0, 1, 4) if piece_r == 0 else
                        (3, 4, -1) if piece_r == 1 else
                        (15, -1, -4) if piece_r == 2 else
                        (12, -4, 1))

    (..4) x: (..4) y: yield x, y, ' ' != piece[origin + x*xs + y*ys]
</code></pre>
<p>(Arguably the procedure header should have some indication that it
expects a block.)  Then you could invoke it like this:</p>
<pre><code>rotate_piece(pieces[piece], piece_r) x, y:
    piece_rotated[x][y] = it
</code></pre>
<p>I really miss list comprehensions a lot in C and Golang.</p>
<h3>Makefont event dispatch</h3>
<p>Here’s some annoying code from another yeso program, <a href="https://gitlab.com/kragen/bubbleos/tree/master/yeso/makefont.c">makefont.c</a>:</p>
<pre><code>for (yw_event *ev; (ev = yw_get_event(w));) {
  if (yw_as_die_event(ev)) {
    yw_close(w);
    free(img.p);
    img.p = 0;
    return 0;
  }

  yw_key_event *kev = yw_as_key_event(ev);
  if (kev &amp;&amp; kev-&gt;down) {
    if (kev-&gt;keysym &lt;= '~') {
      current_char = kev-&gt;keysym;
      yp_p2 newsize = font.g[current_char].size;
      if (newsize.x || newsize.y) defsize = newsize;
    } else switch(kev-&gt;keysym) {
        #define IF break; case
        IF yk_shift_l: display_text = 0;
        IF yk_left: if (off.x) off.x -= 128;
        IF yk_right: off.x += 128;
        IF yk_up: if (off.y) off.y -= 128;
        IF yk_down: off.y += 128;
        IF yk_pgdn: write_out_the_font(&amp;font, argv[1]);
      }
  }

  if (kev &amp;&amp; !kev-&gt;down &amp;&amp; kev-&gt;keysym == yk_shift_l) display_text = 1;

  yw_mouse_event *mev = yw_as_mouse_event(ev);
  if (mev) {
    yp_p2 xy = yp_p_add(mev-&gt;p, off);
    if ((mev-&gt;buttons &amp; 1) &amp;&amp; !(buttons &amp; 1)) {
      font.g[current_char].start = xy;
      font.g[current_char].size.x = defsize.x;
      update_height(&amp;font, current_char, defsize.y);

...
</code></pre>
<p>This becomes something like:</p>
<pre><code>w.events ev:
    be ev Die -&gt;
        return 0
    be Key(_, keysym, Down) -&gt; (
        be keysym Ascii(ch) -&gt; current_char &lt;- ch
        be Shift_L -&gt; display_text &lt;- False
        be Left -&gt; if (xoff): xoff -= 128
        be Right -&gt; xoff += 128
        be Up -&gt; if (yoff): yoff -= 128
        be Down -&gt; yoff += 128
        be _ -&gt; None
    )
    be Key(_, Shift_l, Up) -&gt; display_text &lt;- True
    be Mouse((x, y), new_buttons) -&gt;
        x += xoff
        y += yoff
        if bit(new_buttons, 1) &amp;&amp; !bit(old_buttons, 1):
            update_height(&amp;font, current_char, 0)
            font.g[current_char] = ((x, y), (0, 0))
</code></pre>
<p>The cleanup code is taken care of elsewhere by wrappers and deferred
cleanup functions.  I’m not sure how the keysym names and other
constructor names are in scope so we don’t have to say <code>yeso.Up</code> or
indeed <code>yeso.Key</code>; maybe a declaration like <code>use yeso.keys as yk</code>
would allow us to use <code>yk.Up</code> and be adequate.  The name collision
between <code>Down</code> for a keydown event and <code>Down</code> for the down-arrow key
is unfortunate.</p>
<p>Some amount of type declaration might simplify that — if we know that
keysym is a keysym, we could bring the keysym constructors into scope
for the pattern-matches.</p>
<p>An interesting possibility for dynamic allocation is to use explicit
region-based allocation, in which each function has the possibility of
constructing an arena that is freed when it returns, and can pass that
region to other functions so that they can dynamically allocate things
in it that will survive their return.</p>
<h2>Uncorp</h2>
<p>I feel like the above is a very ambitious language design for someone
who’s only done much simpler languages before, and perhaps it isn’t
ideally suited for a language that will need to have two
implementations kept in sync for bootstrapping purposes.</p>
<p>As a first step, I think I should implement a reverse-polish-notation
portable assembler, “uncorp”, which supports most of the semantics of
my desired language but without types or syntax.  You’d have the usual
unsigned integer ALU operations (<code>+</code> <code>-</code> <code>*</code> <code>/</code> <code>&amp;</code> <code>|</code> <code>~</code> <code>^</code> <code>&lt;&lt;</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;</code> <code>&lt;</code> and maybe <code>sex8</code> <code>sex16</code> <code>sex32</code>), the usual memory-access
operations (<code>!</code> <code>@</code> <code>C!</code> <code>C@</code>), a stack operation or two (<code>DROP</code>,
say), and some basic control structures — at least <code>IF</code>-<code>ELSE</code>-<code>THEN</code>
and <code>LOOP</code>-<code>WHILE</code>-<code>REPEAT</code>.  For function call, yield, and return, I
propose:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>: foo</code> to define the label <code>foo</code> at the current position,
  potentially backpatching earlier references;</li>
<li><code>foo call</code> to call <code>foo</code> with access to the current operand stack,
  which is far less convenient than the usual RPN syntax, but avoids
  the need to predeclare labels before calling them;</li>
<li><code>28 enter</code> to create a 28-byte stack frame containing a link to the
  old stack frame and install it on the frame pointer;</li>
<li><code>28 ret</code> to restore the frame pointer, pop the 28 bytes, and return,
  preserving the operand stack;</li>
<li><code>fp</code> to get a pointer to the current stack frame;</li>
<li><code>n fp+</code> <code>n fp+@</code>, <code>n fp+!</code>, <code>n fp+c@</code>, and <code>n fp+c!</code> to get
  addresses or load and store into the current stack frame (the last
  four are strictly speaking superfluous, but will make it much easier
  to generate reasonable code on i386 and amd64);</li>
<li><code>foo bar yield</code> to set the frame pointer to <code>foo</code> and jump to <code>bar</code>
  with the previous frame pointer and the program counter after
  <code>yield</code> on the operand stack, ready for another <code>yield</code> to return to
  where you were.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not quite powerful enough for cooperative threading or
exception handling, for both of which <code>yield</code> would also need to set
the stack pointer, but it’s adequate for the downward-funargs case,
whether you’re passing the frame pointer implicitly (as for the
single-level downward-funargs cases I contemplated above) or
explicitly.  Given that, it’s probably better to have separate
operations for setting the stack pointer, if desired.</p>
<p>This version of Uncorp has some desirable properties.  A completely
naïve compiler should be very easy to write and usably efficient, if
several times slower than decent code.  A slightly less naïve compiler
that just does register allocation for the operand stack should come
within a factor of two or so of optimized C for a reasonably wide
range of code.  It can be extended with vector operations easily.  And
it can support the features I was describing above.</p>
<p>One tricky bit is how big the frame pointer is supposed to be.
Remember this is supposed to be a <em>portable</em> assembler, targeting at
least AVR, armel, armeb, aarch64, i386, and amd64, and I’d like it to
also be <em>deterministic</em>.  I think this design is too untyped to be
efficiently deterministic for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>because of the endianness issues across these architectures;</li>
<li>because address arithmetic is going to have word-size-dependent
  overflow;</li>
<li>and because it’s impossible to bounds-check address arithmetic, so,
  say, subtracting a stack pointer from a function pointer is going to
  produce platform-dependent results that moreover may be too large
  for some platforms to even represent.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now I’m going to not worry about that, but it’s a thing to keep in
mind as a reason to replace Uncorp.  A little bit of compile-time
computation, like <code>[ 24 ptrsize + ] enter</code>, might be enough to take
care of this.</p>
<p>So the bootstrapping plan is to write an Uncorp interpreter in
something easy and widespread, like JS or Python, and then an Uncorp
compiler for amd64-ELF in Uncorp.  Then I can write a compiler for the
more usable imperative language above in Uncorp, and then compilers
and interpreters for higher-level languages in that language.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kragen/stoneknifeforth">StoneKnifeForth</a> is 204 lines of code or 132 lines without comments,
and compiles a language with 20 primitives.  The 32 or so primitives
of Uncorp should therefore require something like 300 lines of code,
per platform.  This is a lot worse than the 104 lines of my
implementation of Chifir but barely more than my implementation of
Tetris.</p>
<p>But wait!  Uncorp also needs to be able to initialize variables by
putting labeled binary numbers into the executable.  It probably
doesn’t need explicit .data and .text directives (unless we want to
support .bss or generate machine code from binary numbers) but it does
need <code>d8</code>, <code>d16</code>, <code>d32</code>, and <code>d64</code> compile-time operations.  And, as
mentioned above, it needs support for compile-time computation — maybe
not defining functions at compile-time, but at least things like <code>[ 23
ptrsize * 11 + ]</code>, and probably alignment too, which means you need
access to the current compilation address in both .data and .text.  So
maybe it will be twice that, like 600 lines, though maybe more of that
can be shared between platforms.</p>
<p>I don’t think it should be the job of the source program to generate
ELF headers or symbol tables, because the objective of Uncorp is to be
a <em>portable</em> assembly: it should at least be possible and ideally very
easy to write reasonably efficient Uncorp programs that can run
without change on several different platforms.</p>
<p>What would list comprehensions look like in a C-level language?  We
don’t want to saddle the containing function with handling failures,
so we would like to avoid heap allocation.  Stack allocation can, of
course, fail, but perhaps this is less of a problem; it has no
fragmentation to deal with, so proving that it won't fail seems more
tractable — although it does require bounding the list length.</p>
<p>Allocation doesn't entirely go away as a concern, though.  For things
like any(), all(), sum(), min(), or max(), or foreach, there is no
real allocation problem, because we can probably evaluate the sequence
lazily.  But what if we really do want to store the results in an
indexable or reiterable sequence?  We need an array.</p>
<p>The stack-allocation discipline means that a callee’s arrays will not
be available to the caller, but block arguments can come to the rescue
here — the callee can yield control to the caller’s block with the
freshly-allocated array.</p>
<p>Conventional downward-growing stacks and addition-indexed arrays are
not a very good match here.  Either you must implicitly reverse the
array generated from the comprehension at the end, you must grow it
upwards, you must periodically relocate it during the comprehension to
a larger buffer size, or you must index it by subtraction.  Of these
options I think the implicit reversal is the best.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
