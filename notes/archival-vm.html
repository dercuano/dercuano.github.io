(6 minutes)</div><p>Software has a very variable lifetime.  There are a few programs
written in the 1970s that are still in use today, some 40 years later:
many Unix utilities (including vi, now nvi), BRL-CAD, SPICE, Maxima,
TeX, Smalltalk, and so on.  There are many programs from the 1980s
that are still in use today, 30 years later: much of X-Windows,
MS-DOS, GNU Emacs, GCC, other GNU utilities, LaTeX, parts of Microsoft
Windows, and so on.</p>
<p>In many of these cases, little of the original code remains; 30 or 40
years of maintenance have changed it considerably.</p>
<p>In order for our programming efforts to become part of the
intellectual heritage of humanity, rather than be forgotten, they
apparently need to be continually maintained. blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Urban Müller’s BF, inspired by Wouter van Oortmerssen’s False, is a
virtual machine design with eight instructions that you can implement
in half an hour in a page of code.  It’s probably close to the
simplest virtual machine design that you can write real programs for;
Linus Åkesson has written a Game of Life for it in a bit under four
kilobytes.  People have compiled text adventures and fractal renderers
to it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, BF is a terrible machine to program for.  It has no
subroutine-call mechanism, limited ability to index into memory, and
limited arithmetic; straightforward implementations are exponentially
inefficient, and even advanced implementations can be inefficient.</p>
<p>I’d like an archival virtual machine meeting the following
requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>within an order of magnitude of BF in difficulty to implement —
   which is to say, less than five hours and ten pages of code;</li>
<li>within an order of magnitude of native code in performance when
   implemented in that way;</li>
<li>within an order of magnitude of native code in programming
   difficulty, say, with an assembler;</li>
<li>with high probability that a reimplementation from the
   specification will be compatible.</li>
</ol>
<p>A simple reading of #1 suggests that the VM should have as few
instructions as possible, and shouldn’t have more than about 80
different instructions, but really it depends a great deal on how
complex the instructions are.  Some instructions can be implemented in
a single line of code in the VM, while others might require a page of
it.</p>
<p>A simple reading of #2 suggests that you need to keep your
interpretation overhead down to no more than about, say, 9
instructions per virtual machine instruction.  Unfortunately, this is
really difficult!  Threaded-code systems like Forths do manage to do
it in about 5, at the expense of needing to compile to threaded code
first, and of things like type-checking and bounds-checking.  </p>
<p>We also need to ensure that the VM’s instruction set is sufficiently
expressive that you don’t need three VM instructions to do what one
native-code instruction could do.  Forths often suffer from this; it's
easy to need to do <code>OVER OVER -</code> where a single subtract instruction
would suffice on a three-address machine.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2015004_cuneiform.pdf">Chifir virtual machine</a>, designed to run an emulator for the
Smalltalk-72 virtual machine, has one register and 15 three-address
instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>jump (PC ← M[A])</li>
<li>conditional jump (if M[B] = 0, then PC ← M[A])</li>
<li>store program counter (M[A] ← PC)</li>
<li>move (M[A] ← M[B])</li>
<li>load (M[A] ← M[M[B]])</li>
<li>store (M[M[B]] ← M[A])</li>
<li>add (M[A] ← M[B] + M[C])</li>
<li>sub (M[A] ← M[B] - M[C])</li>
<li>mul (M[A] ← M[B] × M[C])</li>
<li>div (M[A] ← M[B] ÷ M[C])</li>
<li>mod (M[A] ← M[B] % M[C])</li>
<li>cmp (M[A] ← M[B] &lt; M[C] ? 1 : 0)</li>
<li>nand (M[A] ← ~(M[B] &amp; M[C]))</li>
<li>refresh the screen</li>
<li>block until a character is available from the keyboard and store it in M[A]</li>
</ol>
<p>Requirement #3, that it not be too much of a pain to program, also
exerts pressure in favor of a large, expressive instruction set.</p>
<p>Requirement #4, like #1, exerts substantial pressure on simplicity,
but also runs strongly counter to including facilities like division
(what do you do on division by zero?), floating-point arithmetic,
signed integer arithmetic, and possibly other accesses to memory
during the same instruction as a memory write (what order do they
happen in?).  All of these provide dangerous opportunities for
implementations to diverge.</p>
<p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine has an interesting feature that could
help to ameliorate some of these tensions: its registers (in its case,
on a stack) are 256 bits, 32 bytes.  You could imagine a virtual
machine with similarly wide registers, but with SIMD instructions,
like 3DNow, SSE and NEON; in some cases, not only would this allow a
single instruction to do the work of several native instructions, it
would allow the programmer to omit writing an explicit loop.</p>
<p>Another way to ameliorate these tensions somewhat is to combine
several different operations into a single instruction.  For example,
if we have a register that always contains 0, another that always
contains 1, and a third that always contains -1, then a single
three-register A += B*C instruction (known as MAC or sometimes FMA)
provides ADD, SUB, MUL, and clear-register as special cases; if the
instruction works in complex cases, it is guaranteed to work in simple
cases as well.  Similarly, A ^= B&amp;C provides AND, XOR, NAND, ANDNOT
(BIC), and NOT as special cases.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/instruction-sets.html">Instruction sets</a> (40 notes)
