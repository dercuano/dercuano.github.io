(2 minutes)</div><p>The traditional approach to generating noise with a digital circuit is
to use a maximal-length LFSR, which has the great advantage of using
only a single bit operation per generated bit, although XOR is perhaps
a somewhat more complicated bit operation than NAND or abjunction.</p>
<p>A crucial feature of the LFSR is that its state transitions are
reversible; they do not lose information.  Consequently its cycles
form a partition of the state space; every state is the successor of
some state, by a counting argument.  In maximal-length LFSRs, there
are two cycles: one of period 1, containing just the zero state, and
one containing all the other states.</p>
<p>When thinking about generating digital noise on CPUs, it is
interesting to think about other available reversible operations.  For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotating left or right by a constant number of bits.</li>
<li>Adding or XORing a constant.</li>
<li>Multiplying by an odd number.<ul>
<li>As a special case, 2’s-complement negation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Permuting the bits or bytes of the state vector with a constant
  permutation.</li>
<li>XORing any part of the state vector with the state vector, as long
  as no bits XOR with themselves, which is irreversible.</li>
<li>Multiplying by a constant m modulo some other relatively prime
  constant n, iff the current state is less than n.</li>
<li>Running an arbitrary substitution on the bit vector via a constant
  lookup table.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are, as it turns out, the usual building blocks of symmetric
cryptosystems and hash functions.</p>
<p>What if we investigate the periods and spectra of the functions
comprised of different sequences of these operations?  Perhaps we
could find something that was fast to execute on a CPU, but also
provided long-period white noise.</p>
<p>Such techniques are also useful for hashing to, for example, generate
Perlin noise.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
