(1 minute)</div><p>One useful measure for security through obscurity might be running on
a platform that doesn’t have a lot of out-of-the-box exploits
available for it.  GEF supports x86, ARM, AARCH64, MIPS, PowerPC, and
SPARC, but GDB also supports ARC, MicroBlaze, m68k, NDS32, Nios II,
S/390, and TMS320C6x; of these, m68k is pretty comfortable and has a
lot of tooling available, so might be a good choice.</p>
<p>The J1A or RISC-V might also be pretty reasonable platforms, but a bit
bleeding-edge.</p>
<p>Linux on m68k seems to be pretty dead (web page not updated since
2000; last Debian release Etch) and FreeBSD is gone too, but NetBSD
still supports m68k.  Also HP-PA, SuperH, and VAX.  These are “Tier
II” ports.  There are a number of JIT 68000 emulators for popular
machines; Basilisk II (GPL) successfully runs old versions of MacOS,
and there’s a reasonable amount of interest in QEMU support for it;
QEMU at one point in 2014 got to being able to boot Linux/m68k on an
emulated Mac, barely.  These unfortunately require Macintosh ROMs.</p>
<p>GCC also, crucially, supports m68k, up to at least GCC 4.9 and maybe
GCC 5, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>(Unicorn also, unfortunately, supports m68k.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/instruction-sets.html">Instruction sets</a> (40 notes)
