(3 minutes)</div><p>DJB makes a good argument for using crit-bit trees as the fundamental
string-set data structure: you get to use two words of memory per
string, or three if you store the strings as pointers instead of
inline in the nodes.</p>
<p>The trouble is, how do you generalize it?  A hash table can store
pointers to arbitrary objects as long as they support .hash() and
.equals() methods.  But crit-bit trees can apparently store only
strings.</p>
<p>For a small set of strings, you could perhaps do even better.  For up
to 128 strings, say, you could use parallel arrays: </p>
<pre><code>uchar left[128],  // left child pointer (as array index)
      right[128], // right child pointer
      nbits[128], // number of bits to skip from parent node bit offset
      start[128], // string #3 is contents[start[3]:start[3]+length[3]]
      length[128], 
      contents[256];
</code></pre>
<p>These definitions support strings of up to 256 bytes total, with no
shared prefix of 256 bits, 32 bytes, or more; the high bit being set
in a pointer indicates a leaf node.  Increasing <code>start</code> to 16 bits per
entry allows your strings to be up to 255 bytes each, removing the
aggregate limit.</p>
<p>An empty dict in CPython costs about 180 bytes.  With a structure like</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct { uchar left[N], right[N], nbits[N]; object *out[N]; } tinydict;
</code></pre>
<p>you have some 7 bytes per potential entry in your dict; that gives you
Python's degree of overhead at N=25, so N=16 is probably a reasonable
choice, using up 112 bytes per tinydict.  (At which point you could
save a little further space by using nibbles, but don't.)</p>
<p>An amusing thing about these parallel-array structures: like PHP's
arrays, they have an implicit sequence to them, the sequence of array
indices.  You could imagine a routine that shuffles the order of
treenodes around without changing the shape of the tree, thus
providing an additional traversal order.</p>
<p>A larger <code>tinydict</code>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct { u16 left[N2], right[N2], nbits[N2]; object *out[N2]; } smalldict;
</code></pre>
<p>This can support up to 64Ki items.</p>
<p>What does the protocol for an <code>object</code> look like?  Presumably you have
a <code>.key()</code> method which returns a sequence of bytes — perhaps a lazy
sequence, one or a few words at a time.</p>
<p>As an amusing exercise, perhaps many objects could be normally stored
as strings, with a small cache (a few kilobytes) of objects built in
a pointer-filled manner.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
