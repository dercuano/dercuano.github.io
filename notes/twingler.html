(7 minutes)</div><p>In <a href="http://blog.plover.com/notes/twingler.html">Twingler, a generic data structure munger</a>, Mark-Jason
Dominus proposes a new broadly-useful DSL.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Given</p>
<pre><code>[
    [Chi, Ill],
    [NY, NY],
    [Alb, NY],
    [Spr, Ill],
    [Tr, NJ],
    [Ev, Ill],
]
</code></pre>
<p>he wants to easily write the transformation to DS1:</p>
<pre><code>{ Ill =&gt; [Chi, Ev, Spr],
  NY  =&gt; [Alb, NY],
  NJ  =&gt; [Tr],
}
</code></pre>
<p>for example, or to any of DS2:</p>
<pre><code>{
  Chi =&gt; Ill,
  NY =&gt; NY, 
  Alb =&gt; NY,
  Spr =&gt; Ill,
  Tr =&gt; NJ,
  Ev =&gt; Ill,
}
</code></pre>
<p>DS3:</p>
<pre><code>{ Ill =&gt; [Chi, Spr, Ev],
  NY  =&gt; [NY, Alb],
  NJ  =&gt; Tr,
}
</code></pre>
<p>(unnamed):</p>
<pre><code>{ Ill =&gt; 3,
  NY  =&gt; 2,
  NJ  =&gt; 1,
}
</code></pre>
<p>or DS4:</p>
<pre><code>[ Chi, Ill, NY, NY, Alb, NY, Spr, Ill, Tr, NJ, Ev, Ill]
</code></pre>
<p>As a current example of how it is currently unnecessarily
difficult to write the first transformation, he gives the
Perl</p>
<pre><code>my $out;
for my $pair (@$in) {
    push @{$out-&gt;{$pair-&gt;[0]}}, $pair-&gt;[1];
}
for my $k (keys %$out) {
    @{$out-&gt;{$k}} = sort @{$out-&gt;{$k}};
}
</code></pre>
<p>and suggests that even the abbreviated syntax</p>
<pre><code>for pair (in.items) :
  out[pair[0]].append(pair[1])
for list (out.values) :
  list.sort
</code></pre>
<p>is unnecessarily complicated.</p>
<h2>MJD’s Twingler templates</h2>
<p>he ends up suggesting</p>
<pre><code>DS1: [ &lt;[X,Y]&gt; ]
DS2: { &lt;X=&gt;Y&gt;  }
DS3: { &lt;X =&gt; [&lt;Y&gt;]&gt; }
DS4: [ &lt;X, Y&gt; ]
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is “ITERATE over the thing inside and make a list
of the results,” like <code>map</code> in Perl or <code>flatMap</code> in Scala,
and <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are the first two dimensions of a sort of
adjacency matrix computed in an unspecified way from the
original data:</p>
<pre><code>        Ill        NY        NJ
Chi     X
NY              X
Alb             X
Spr     X
Tr                      X
Ev      X
</code></pre>
<p>...or two columns, I guess, considering the original data as
an N-ary relation represented simply as a list-of-lists.
(You could probably use the same or similar notation to
specify how to reduce the original data to an N-ary
relation.)</p>
<p>I don’t understand how his four expressions above give the
four data structures explained previously; it seems like the
DS3 expression <code>{ &lt;X =&gt; [&lt;Y&gt;]&gt; }</code> should give DS1 rather than
DS3, while the DS1 expression should give the original input.
I’m going to assume this is just an error MJD made.</p>
<p>MJD points out that you can easily incorporate arbitrary
functions into the template:</p>
<pre><code>{ &lt;X =&gt; max(&lt;Y&gt;) }
</code></pre>
<p>Later he gives the example, given the table</p>
<pre><code>|----+------+--------+---------+------|
| ID | NAME | SHADE  | PALETTE | DESC |
|----+------+--------+---------+------|
| A  | AAA  | red    | pink    | Aaa  |
| B  | BBB  | yellow | tawny   | Bbb  |
| A  | AAA  | green  | nude    | Aaa  |
| B  | BBB  | blue   | violet  | Bbb  |
| C  | CCC  | black  | nude    | Ccc  |
|----+------+--------+---------+------|
</code></pre>
<p>how to compute</p>
<pre><code>{ A =&gt; [ AAA, [ [red, pink], [green, nude] ], Aaa],
  B =&gt; [ BBB, [ [yellow, tawny], [blue, violet] ], Bbb],
  C =&gt; [ CCC, [ [black, nude] ], CCC]
}
</code></pre>
<p>using the expression</p>
<pre><code>{ &lt; ID =&gt; [
             name,
             [ &lt;[shade, palette]&gt; ]
             desc
          ]&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>His original examples are fairly easily handled with
mapreduce, which hadn’t been identified yet when he wrote his
notes, and although this one is too, it points the way to
examples that are not so easily handled.  For example, the
classic <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/Titanic.html">Titanic dataset</a>, included with R and containing
information on survival by gender, age, and class, could be
reasonably munged into any of</p>
<pre><code>{&lt;Class =&gt; {&lt;Sex =&gt; {&lt;Age =&gt; {&lt;Survived =&gt; N&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}
{&lt;Sex =&gt; {&lt;Class =&gt; {&lt;Age =&gt; {&lt;Survived =&gt; N&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}
{&lt;Sex =&gt; {&lt;Age =&gt; {&lt;Class =&gt; {&lt;Survived =&gt; N&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}
{&lt;Sex =&gt; {&lt;Age =&gt; {&lt;Survived =&gt; {&lt;Class =&gt; N&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}
</code></pre>
<p>as well as many other forms.  This is not a task you can do
with mapreduce.</p>
<p>(I’m not referring to the parallel and fault-tolerant
attributes of mapreduce as implemented by Google or Hadoop,
but to the higher-order <a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2012-July/000548.html">mapreduce function</a> that I’ve
argued should be in Python itertools.)</p>
<h2>QBE</h2>
<p>Later in his post, MJD suggests that it might make more sense
to simply supply a sample input and sample output; e.g.</p>
<pre><code>[ [ A, B ],
  [ C, B ],
  [ D, E ] ]
--------------
{ B =&gt; [A, C],
  E =&gt; [D],
}
</code></pre>
<p>I’m not sure if this kind of QBE will work, but it does seem
like if it works, it would be simpler to use, despite needing
more verbose input.  The idea is that, instead of specifying
iteration with a separate iteration operator, you specify it
by iteration.  Consider the slightly harder problem</p>
<pre><code>[ [ A, B ],
  [ C, B ],
  [ D, E ] ]
--------------
[ [B, [A, C]],
  [E, [D]],
]
</code></pre>
<p>This is unambiguous, but if we delete the first output item
to get</p>
<pre><code>[ [ D, E ] ]
--------------
[ [E, [D]] ]
</code></pre>
<p>that could mean either the original</p>
<pre><code>[ [ A, B ],
  [ C, B ],
  [ D, E ] ]
--------------
[ [B, [A, C]],
  [E, [D]],
]
</code></pre>
<p>or the alternative</p>
<pre><code>[ [ A, B ],
  [ C, B ],
  [ D, E ] ]
--------------
[ [B, [A]],
  [B, [C]],
  [E, [D]],
]
</code></pre>
<p>although this is not possible in the hash case.</p>
<p>I think this might be less wieldy in the case of deep
nesting, and it doesn’t accommodate functions like <code>count</code> or
<code>max</code> as easily.  Consider the Titanic example</p>
<pre><code>{&lt;Sex =&gt; {&lt;Class =&gt; {&lt;Age =&gt; {&lt;Survived =&gt; N&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}&gt;}
</code></pre>
<p>which could be written as</p>
<pre><code>[ [First, Male, Adult, Yes, 24] ]
----
{ Male =&gt; { First =&gt; { Adult =&gt; { Yes =&gt; 24 } } } }
</code></pre>
<p>and is thus no problem; but if we instead want nested lists
of pairs, we are in trouble:</p>
<pre><code>[ [First, Male, Adult, Yes, 24] ]
----
[ [Male, [ [First, [ [Adult, [ [Yes, 24] ]] ]] ]] ]
</code></pre>
<p>which is hopelessly ambiguous; we need at least one
repetition at each level to specify it properly:</p>
<pre><code>[ [First, Male, Adult, Yes, 24],
  [First, Male, Adult, No, 25],
  [First, Male, Child, Yes, 26],
  [Crew, Male, Adult, Yes, 27],
  [First, Female, Adult, Yes, 28],
]
---
[ [Male, [ [First, [ [Adult, [ [Yes, 24],
                               [No,  25] ]],
                     [Child, [ [Yes, 26] ]] ]],
           [Crew,  [ [Adult, [ [Yes, 27] ]] ]] ]],
  [Female, [ [First, [ [Adult, [Yes, 28] ]] ]] ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>which is, at least to me, less readable than</p>
<pre><code>[ &lt;[Sex, [ &lt;[Class, [ &lt;[Age, [ &lt;[Survived, N]&gt; ] 
                    ]&gt; ] 
         ]&gt; ]
]&gt; ]
</code></pre>
<p>although I’m not going to try to claim that that’s some kind of
paragon of readability either.</p>
<h2>JSON</h2>
<p>Twingle is a great deal more interesting today than in the
late 1990s when MJD originally invented it, because now we
have a great deal of data on the web (and other places!)
represented as JSON.  The fundamental aggregate data types
in JSON are the same fundamental data types Twingle handles,
and simple transformations between different representations
of such datasets is a ubiquitous task.</p>
<h2>Binate</h2>
<p>At first, I was thinking that maybe <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/binary-relations">Binate</a> would be
useful for this kind of transformation, since binary
relations are awfully similar to the Perl dictionaries being
represented by <code>{}</code> here; and Binate might well be more
compact than the Twingle representation.</p>
<p>However, binary relations sort of erase the distinction
between dicts and lists. XXX</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
