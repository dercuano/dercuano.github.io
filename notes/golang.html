<ul>
<li>The email address parsing functionality is a little tied into the
  email system; you apparently have to make a fake header.</li>
<li>go doc is pretty cool, but looking at the actual library source is
  even better in most cases.</li>
<li>Type equivalence is by name, so even if a mail.Header <em>is</em> just a
  map[string][]string, you still can't mutate it.  But you can
  construct a new one.</li>
<li>for x := range somearray makes x range over the indices of
  somearray, not its values.  You want _, x :=.</li>
<li>How do you find the length of an array?  Oh, Pythonwise, len(array).</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, so suppose I want to do the equivalent of this Python:</p>
<pre><code>def main(outbox, inbox):
    important_senders = recipients(outbox)
</code></pre>
<p>I guess I need to be able to open the outbox file and accumulate
stuff in a map.  Hmm, isn't there a thing about named return values?
How does that work?  Oh, (name type, name type, name type) after the
argument list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I open a file?  os.Open.</p>
</li>
<li>How do I print messages to stderr and return failure from main?
  Looks like log.Fatal does that, and even log.Printf prints to
  stderr.  (Presumably fmt.Printf doesn't.)</li>
<li>Now that I have the file open, how do I get messages from it?  Looks
  like the file is already an io.Reader, so I'm good.</li>
<li>Hmm, now it seems like I'm suffering from email parsing problems,
  from apparently trying to parse a header starting in the middle of a
  subject line.  I guess I need to read that message body.</li>
<li>But hmm, io.Reader.Read(p) reads up to len(p) bytes.  How do I make
  a slice (?) that I can pass in there?  (Looks like make([]byte, 16).)
  Oh, there's an
  ioutil.ReadAll?  That solves the problem.  But now I still have no
  addresses! ...
  Also related to problems like these: bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin) 
  and r.ReadString("\n").</li>
<li>Oh, hmm, this is just message parsing, not mailbox parsing.  I still
  have to do mailbox parsing myself, and provide an io.Reader
  interface?  Well, there's an io.LimitReader in the library.</li>
<li>Cool, the I/O 2011 talk mentions an SDL binding for Go.</li>
<li>Looks like the email message parsing chokes on this:<pre><code>To: Kragen Sitaker &lt;kragen&gt;
</code></pre>
