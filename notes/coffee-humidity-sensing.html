<p>How can you measure the humidity of coffee, rice, beans, yerba mate,
flour, oatmeal, polenta, wood, clay, concrete, soil, plastics, and so
on?</p>
<p>The measurement techniques described in <a href="../notes/trellis-coded-buttons.html">Trellis-coded buttons to run a whole keyboard off two microcontroller pins</a> can be
applied to humidity measurement, but there are additional issues.</p>
<h2>The importance of humidity</h2>
<p>On Earth, humidity is a crucially important property for many
purposes.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Dried food stored with too much moisture can grow mold, and in
particular mold on improperly stored legumes is one of the major
causes of human liver cancer in the world, by way of aflatoxin
contamination in the food eaten by the humans.  Also, extra moisture
in food represents extra weight that must be stored and sometimes
moved, and food is often sold by weight, so standards of marketability
impose maximum humidity contents on foods.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/deep-freeze.html">Deep freeze</a> talks a bit about moisture content of marketed dry
food (11% or less for marketed soybeans, for example).  <a href="../notes/food-storage.html">Food storage</a> talks a bit about moisture as a factor in food decay.</p>
<h3>Wood and wood products</h3>
<p>Wood expands and contracts considerably according to humidity, and so
must be dried to roughly the proper humidity before being made into
things, so that it doesn’t expand or contract too much after being
assembled; also, ever since the development of lignolytic enzymes such
as lignin peroxidase (probably at the end of the Carboniferous),
already-installed wood is subject to attack by fungus if it’s humid.</p>
<p>Additionally, humidity in installed wood can indicate the presence of
termites, which will destroy the wood, or a water leak, which may
destroy things in contact with the wood, as well as permitting fungal
growth, as above.</p>
<p>Wood products like fiberboard and particle board are similar to wood
in this way, but some of them additionally suffer direct degradation
from being wetted.  Most varieties of MDF expand about 60% in the
cross-grain direction when they get wet, losing most of their already
rather pitiful strength in the process, and the adhesives used in in
particle board are also often degraded by getting wet, even if the
moisture doesn’t last long enough to permit mold attack.</p>
<p>Dry wood and wood products also provide substantial insulation values,
while their wet versions do not.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/solar-air-conditioner.html">A design sketch of an air conditioner powered by solar thermal power</a> talks a bit about various organic
hygroscopic substances, including wood, and how much water they can
absorb: dry wood contains about 12% moisture, while wood in
equilibrium with a humid atmosphere can contain up to 25% to 30%
humidity.</p>
<h3>Clay</h3>
<p>The physical properties of a clay body† prepared for pottery-making
depend sensitively on its moisture content.  In a couple of percent
near 20% water by weight, it transitions from brittle “dry” clay,
which is still cool to the touch because of the heat-pipe effect as
water evaporates from near the humans’ fingers, to flexible
“leather-hard” clay, which can still be broken, to fully plastic clay
which can be deformed arbitrarily as long as it’s kept in compression.
(Like ductile iron, it still eventually reaches brittle fracture under
sufficient tensile deformation.)  A fully plastic clay body is a
fucking amazing material for forming: it requires very little force to
deform it, and because its elastic deformation is so small as to be
very difficult to measure, which means that once you form it into a
shape, it has very little springback as you remove the forming tool.</p>
<p>There’s a further humidity reduction from “dry” to “bone-dry”, at
which point the object no longer feels cool to the touch, and is ready
for firing.  Bone-dry clay is still brittle, but considerably stronger
than merely “dry” clay.</p>
<p>The precise moisture percentages at which the clay body transitions
between these states vary fairly widely depending on the types of clay
involved and the other ingredients.</p>
<p>As the clay body dries, it contracts, which sets up stresses in the
object, which can deform it, and provokes some dimensional
imprecision — the contraction is typically anisotropic due to not only
anisotropic orientation of clay grains but also because of external
forces present during the contraction process, so the shrinkage is
somewhat unpredictable.  Nearly all of this contraction is between the
“fully plastic” state and the “leather-hard” state; there is
dramatically less contraction from “leather-hard” to “dry”, and none
from “dry” to “bone-dry”, and almost none from “bone-dry” to
bisque-fired (sintered) ceramic.  (Glaze-firing densifies the ceramic
further, producing further contraction.)</p>
<p>In the plastic state, the clay is sticky and tends to adhere to
whatever you use to form it, pulling it out of shape as the forming
contact ends; once it is leather-hard, it is no longer sticky.
Plastic clay in a dry atmosphere forms a thin leather-hard layer at
the surface which can serve to ameliorate this stickiness.</p>
<p>So, if you form clay in the fully plastic state, you get substantial
contraction and consequent imprecision upon drying to leather-dry.  If
you form the clay in the leather-hard state, you can get near-net
shapes, but you are very limited in the deformations you can achieve.
You can also <em>cut</em> leather-hard clay with a blade, getting
glassy-smooth surfaces, although these do not survive bisque firing.
Once the clay is dry, it can be further cut to shape with abrasive
processes, at the risk of shattering the brittle piece.</p>
<p>So, precise measurements of clay moisture content, down to a fraction
of a percent, are very useful for controlling manufacturing processes,
particularly automated manufacturing processes.  The humidity at each
of these transition regions depends on the precise contents of the
clay body, but if you’re using a well-controlled clay body, you can
calibrate your humidity levels to that clay body and get reproducible
manufacturing results.</p>
<p>† For making pottery, we mix clays with other materials, including of
course water, but also sand, other “tempers” such as grog (powdered
fired clay), flocculants, deflocculants, and organic gums, in order to
balance the properties of plasticity, green strength, contraction,
firing temperature, and strength after firing; this mixture is called
a “clay body”, although sometimes in the above I’ve sloppily called it
“clay”.  Pure clay contracts on drying considerably more than
commonly-used clay bodies do, and its green strength and even fired
strength are much lower.</p>
<h3>Concrete</h3>
<p>Concrete needs water to harden, but I think that if it’s too wet,
atmospheric carbon dioxide can’t penetrate, which slows the hardening
process.  If it dries out before hardening fully, it can become
crumbly and impossible to harden.  So, during hardening, it’s
potentially beneficial to monitor the moisture.</p>
<p>Also, continued exposure to water can degrade concrete, particularly
if the water contains high concentrations of, for example, chloride or
hydronium ions.  And, as with wood, moisture in concrete can be a sign
of water leakage, which can eventually result in damage to other
objects if it continues.  If the moisture is sufficient to saturate
the surface of the concrete, it usually becomes very visible to the
humans by darkening the concrete, but if the surface is kept somewhat
dry by exposure to air, moisture in concrete can be entirely
invisible.</p>
<p>So, monitoring moisture in concrete is useful both during hardening
and long afterwards.</p>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<p>Soil moisture is crucially important for plant growth, because if
there isn’t enough moisture in the soil, plants can’t suck it out of
the soil, so they stop growing and eventually die.  Also, if the
moisture levels are too high, you get two kinds of fungal problems and
a bacterial problem: too much water can suffocate symbiotic
mycorrhizal fungi, which are extremely beneficial to land plants
(although some land plants can survive without mycorrhiza); too much
moisture can help non-symbiotic fungi to eat the plants; and, without
access to nitrogen from air, rhizobial bacteria cannot fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>However, the particular level of soil moisture needed for plant growth
depends on the salinity of the soil; roots have a harder time pulling
moisture out of saline soils due to higher osmotic pressure.</p>
<h3>Plastic</h3>
<p>Many common plastics, notably including PET, nylon 6, and PLA, are
hygroscopic; they absorb water from the air.  In ordinary use, this is
rarely a problem, or is even beneficial, but it has a couple of
important effects on melting or hot-forming the plastics.</p>
<p>First, the absorbed water affects the plastics’ specific heat,
generally increasing it, so the plastic heats up more slowly.  Second,
although these plastics are relatively stable in the presence of water
at ordinary temperatures, they hydrolyze at the temperatures used for
forming or melting them.  (Also, PLA in particular, if kept wet,
hydrolyzes to lactate over several months at body temperature, and
several years at room temperature.)  So they must be dried before
molding, which is done by heating them to a lower temperature for
several hours.</p>
<h2>Static permittivity</h2>
<p>Electric charge produces an electric field according to Gauss’s law,
∇·E = ρ/ε₀, where ρ is the charge density and ε₀ is about 8.8541878 ×
10⁻¹² A² s⁴ / kg m³.  But, here on Earth, the electric field we
observe is always lower than this prediction — usually about 0.06%
lower in air, almost 5 times lower in glass, and almost 90 times lower
in pure water.  That is, to get a given field, we need about 0.06%
more charge than this law would predict, or about 5 times as much
charge if the region of interest is mostly filled with glass, or
almost 90 times as much charge underwater.  (Of course, unless our
water is very pure, the charge will leak away over time through
electrolytic currents, but we can do this measurement pretty quickly,
in much less than a nanosecond, so the leakage is small.)</p>
<p>We explain this by a phenomenon called “electric susceptibility”: we
suppose that the molecules of the substance have their own electric
fields, and they interact with the applied field.  For example, in
water, the two hydrogen atoms are kind of on the same side of the
oxygen, and they have a small positive charge, while the oxygen has a
small negative charge, less than an electron.  So if we put a negative
charge on the left of it, it attracts the hydrogens and repels the
oxygen.  Because water is a liquid, the water molecule is free to turn
around, it tends to turn so that its hydrogens are on the left and the
oxygen is on the right (“dipole relaxation”).  So then the water
molecule’s own tiny electric field is subtracted from the electric
field of the negative charge we put to its left, and in fact it
cancels almost 99% of it under ordinary conditions.  So we need 90
times as much charge to get the same electric field as we would
predict from Gauss’s law.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways that charges can move around inside the
substance (“polarize”) in response to the applied electric field.  For
example, in addition to molecules turning around, ions can move around
(“ionic conduction”); crystal structures can deform (“ionic
polarization”); electrical charge can flow to different parts of a
molecule, especially a conjugated compound; and so on.  As a general
principle, though, because opposite charges attract each other, all of
these effects <em>cancel</em> the field somewhat; they never make it
stronger.  The cancellation is never complete, either, because as it
approaches completeness, the leftover field’s influence on the charges
approaches zero, so other influences on them are more important, like
thermal motion.  So we would expect that usually heat would make this
susceptibility go down, and in fact we do see this with water: at
100°, we only need about 55 times as much charge as Gauss’s law
predicts, instead of the 88 times as much charge we need at 0°.</p>
<p>So usually when we apply Gauss’s law, we apply it in the form ∇·E =
ρ/ε, where the ε is a “permittivity” which is ε₀ multiplied by a
“relative permittivity” or “dielectric constant” that includes the
susceptibility of the medium, as well as the inherent “vacuum
permittivity” ε₀.  So, for water at 0°, we say the relative
permittivity is 88, and for water at 100°, we say it is 55.</p>
<p>(This effect is also the main reason light travels at different speeds
through different substances, which is why transparent substances both
refract and reflect light at their surfaces.  Rutile — titanium
dioxide — refracts light so strongly because its permittivity is even
higher than water’s, even though it’s solid.)</p>
<p>Porous, dry organic materials like paper, wood, coffee, beans, and
rice have relative permittivities around 4, which is much smaller than
water’s permittivity of 88.  By coincidence, quartz sand’s relative
permittivity is also about 4 (it’s 3.9) and so is concrete’s (it’s
4.5).  So, if these materials absorb water, their permittivity goes up
substantially.</p>
<h2>Static relative permittivity is just an approximation</h2>
<p>Consider the polarization of water again, though.  It happens by
turning the water molecules around so that their hydrogens are
predominantly on the side toward the negative charge and their oxygens
are on the side toward the positive charge.  It happens that this
effect is close to linear under normal circumstances: slowly applied
fields that are quite small compared to the enormous electric fields
inside the molecule.  But, as you can imagine, this linearity breaks
down under other circumstances.</p>
<p>One aspect of this is that it takes a certain amount of time for the
molecules to come into this alignment, and some of the energy of the
applied field is lost in the process — the molecules in liquid water
are shaking around under the influences of one another’s fields, and
so if you apply a rapid enough jolt of electrical field, they won’t
respond fast enough.  So as the time we’re considering goes to zero,
or frequency goes to infinity, the susceptibility also goes to zero.</p>
<p>(In optics, this variation of permittivity with frequency is called
“chromatic aberration” or more generally “material dispersion”.)</p>
<p>So you could imagine rapidly bringing some charge into proximity with
some water, over a short time period, like an attosecond.  At first
you would observe the whole field predicted by Gauss’s law in its pure
form, the ε₀ form, but then if you left the charge there for a while,
gradually the field would decay down to its usual level of about 1% of
its original value.  Most of the energy has gone out of the field.
Where did it go?</p>
<p>And of course the answer is that it went into heating up the water
molecules: as they rotated around to come into alignment with this
sudden jolt of electrical field, they jostled against each other and
gained some kinetic energy.  And this is how we heat up water in a
microwave oven, by applying an electrical field that goes the other
direction every 210 picoseconds or so.  This loss of electrical energy
to heat is called a “dielectric loss”.  The dielectric loss is often
combined with the dielectric constant into a single complex number
called the “complex permittivity”.</p>
<p>A thing to note there is that the different susceptibility mechanisms
operate on different time scales.  Ionic conduction is a great deal
slower than dipole relaxation, for example, and water always contains
some ions; water absorbed by organic matter or soil usually contains
an enormous quantity of ions.  It happens that ions become more mobile
when the temperature is higher, so the low-frequency permittivity of
moist organic matter is dominated by ionic conduction, and so its
permittivity goes <em>up</em> when it gets hot, instead of down like pure
water’s, at least until it’s close to boiling.  But, for the same
reason, the permittivity of water with lots of ions drops sharply with
frequency, much more sharply than pure water’s, and above a few tens
of megahertz, its permittivity becomes dominated by dipole relaxation
and drops with temperature, for the reason explained above.</p>
<p>So, for example, carrots contain so many solvated ions that, at low
frequencies, they have a relative permittivity of about 600 at 25°,
which increases to about 850 at 45°, but around 100 MHz the
permittivity of carrots is nearly invariant with temperature.  Navel
oranges, which contain many fewer ions, only have a relative
permittivity of about 200 at 25°, which increases to 250 at 45°, and
the point at which their permittivity becomes insensitive to
temperature is about 40 MHz.  (All of this is according to Nelson’s
2006 paper, “Agricultural applications of dielectric measurements.”)</p>
<p>(I am somewhat skeptical of the precision of these numbers;
theoretical considerations suggest that they come from
Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars polarization, which can give you arbitrarily
large permittivities because the charges can be separated by
arbitrarily large distances.)</p>
<p>Not only the permittivity but also the dielectric loss varies with
frequency; the dielectric loss, too, falls with frequency in the
limit, but may locally rise over some frequency range.</p>
<p>Another way this linear approximation can fail is with very strong
fields.  At the macroscopic field strengths we usually observe, the
linear approximation is very good, but you can easily see that once,
for example, all the water molecules are all pretty well lined up with
the applied field, they can’t align themselves any further to cancel
an even stronger applied field; any further electrical susceptibility
must be due to other effects such as the molecules bending, or charge
moving around on them, or ions moving through the water, which are
much weaker effects.  So at high enough field strengths, the relative
permittivity of any substance drops back to almost 1, just like its
relative magnetic permeability.  In optics these deviations from
linearity are called the “Kerr effect”, and they are one of a few ways
to get nonlinear interactions between light beams or to electrically
control light beams at subnanosecond timescales.  (At even higher
field strengths, though, the applied field is stronger than the fields
that hold the molecules together and the substance will ionize.  This
alters its electrical and optical properties more radically.)</p>
<p>This nonlinearity is also very important in practice with ceramic
capacitors; among the highest-dielectric-constant materials available
are the piezoelectric ceramics barium titanate and lead zirconate
titanate, which can have relative permittivities (dielectric
constants) in the thousands, and they make possible high-capacitance
chip capacitors.  But when fully charged to their rated voltage, the
capacitance of these capacitors can drop by almost half — the field is
almost high enough to cause avalanche breakdown of the perovskite
structure, and the permittivity of the dielectric drops dramatically
at such high fields.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think these strong-field effects are important to the
moisture-measurement problem.</p>
<p>Another direction in which the linear approximation fails — for some
substances — is in the limit of long time periods.  The energy stored
in a capacitor at a given field strength is proportional to the
permittivity of the capacitor’s dielectric; by using a
higher-permittivity dielectric, you can store more energy in the same
space.  So why don’t we use water-dielectric capacitors for everything
except cases where miniaturization is paramount, since water is so
much cheaper than lead zirconate titanate?  It turns out that, in the
limit of large times, water will always break down in a constant
electric field, although the time it takes extends exponentially as
the field is reduced.  So water-dielectric capacitors do work, and
they are used for some systems that need to release an enormous amount
of energy very quickly, but they cannot hold their charge for a long
time.</p>
<p>A third direction in which this approximation fails has to do with
anisotropic materials, which can have greater permittivity in some
directions than in others.</p>
<h2>Applying permittivity variation to moisture measurement</h2>
<p>So, suppose you have some ground coffee, and you want to know how much
moisture it contains.  The most straightforward thing to do is to
place an insulated metal plate in contact with the coffee — for
example, a copper pour on a printed circuit board, covered with solder
mask — and charge the plate up to a given voltage, like 3.3 volts.
The amount of charge needed for this will depend on the permittivity
of the coffee.  To measure the charge, you can allow the plate to
discharge through a known, or at least constant, resistance, and
measure the time constant of the decay curve.  This gives you a
measurement which depends on the moisture content of the coffee.</p>
<p>(For a sensor that isn’t connected to earth ground, you might actually
need two equal-size metal plates, one treated as “ground”, to reduce
variation due to the floating voltage of the instrument.)</p>
<p>The problem with this is that, as explained above, the measurement
depends not only on the moisture, but also on the temperature.  It
also depends on how tightly packed the coffee is, because if there’s
more air mixed in with the coffee, that will lower the measured
permittivity.  And in situations where the measurement is being taken
by placing some kind of handheld sensor against the coffee (or wood or
whatever), rather than dumping the coffee into the sensor, you have
the additional variables of the size of the air gap between the sensor
and the coffee, and the percentage of the plate that is in contact
with the coffee.</p>
<p>(I suspect, but am not certain, that all three of density, contact
area, and air gap size will have essentially the same effect, in which
case we can lump them together into a single unknown, “quantity of
material”.)</p>
<p>In an alternative arrangement, you run a sinusoidal AC voltage at a
controlled frequency into the sensor plate (or plates) and measure the
AC current that ensues, thus giving you a measure of capacitance,
which varies linearly with permittivity; the phase shift between the
voltage and the current tells you how large the dielectric losses are.
If you know enough about the substance whose humidity you’re
measuring, you can choose the frequency where its permittivity doesn’t
vary with temperature, only with density and humidity, and then you
can use the dielectric losses to determine how much of the substance
you’re measuring.</p>
<p>More generally, at that point, it’s just a matter of estimating two
unknowns (moisture content and quantity of material) from two
measurements (capacitance and loss factor).</p>
<p>By sweeping the frequency over a wide range, you can obtain a whole
spectrum of complex permittivities at different frequencies, which in
theory can provide you with an arbitrarily large number of possibly
independent measurements.  This could allow you to estimate a larger
number of unknowns, such as temperature, moisture content, density,
air gap size, and contact area, and perhaps even to distinguish
between, for example, coffee, human flesh, and rice.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to use an array of smaller “pixel” contacts;
for example, a 16×16 array of 4 mm × 4 mm contact areas separated by
1-mm gaps would enable an independent permittivity measurement on each
pixel.  This would reduce the problem of unknown contact area (where
an unknown fraction of the sensor plate is in contact with the
material being measured) and also permit the generation of images.</p>
<p>In the cases of soil and concrete, an important additional unknown is
salinity.  In soil in particular, higher salinity increases
permittivity and conductivity, but makes water less available to
plants, while higher moisture increases permittivity and conductivity,
while making water more available to plants.  So if we want to measure
the soil’s need for irrigation, but don’t know the salinity, a simple
permittivity measurement is insufficient — we need to estimate both
the moisture content and the salinity, and probably the density and
temperature as well.  For irrigation measurements in particular, it
may be feasible to supplement the permittivity measurements with
resistivity measurements and thermometer measurements, if you’re
leaving the sensor embedded in the soil long enough to measure its
temperature to some degree of precision.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to controlling for temperature effects is to
intentionally heat the material being measured during the sensing
process.  The dielectric losses being measured will deposit a small
and approximately known amount of heat into the substance being
measured; since some of the temperature coefficients of permittivity
we’re talking about above are as high as 2% per degree (20000 ppm/K),
even small temperature shiffts might be detectable, and might provide
a much-needed additional dimension of variation.  That is, you can map
the complex permittivity of the sample not just at many frequencies
but at many frequencies at many temperatures.</p>
<h3>Harmonics and analog electronics</h3>
<p>If you’re generating the stimulus signal from something like an AVR
Arduino, the signals you can generate are somewhat limited — the AVR
can easily generate square waves of up to about 4 MHz, and I think
that by hacking the SPI you can generate a somewhat noisy 8-MHz square
wave.  More modern cheap microcontrollers like the STM32L0 and STMF0
lines (see <a href="../notes/stm32.html">Notes on the STM32 microcontroller family</a>) can easily generate square waves and pulse
trains at a few tens of MHz.  However, as mentioned earlier, the
permittivity of moist organic material has important variations up to
and above 100 MHz — in particular, you often have to go that high for
the dipole-relaxation mechanism to be the dominant contributor to the
dielectric constant.</p>
<p>However, an 8-MHz square wave has significant harmonics at 24 MHz,
40 MHz, 56 MHz, and 72 MHz.  Perhaps a small amount of analog
circuitry connected to the outside of the microcontroller could
filter out a particular harmonic for later conversion.</p>
<p>However, if you’re doing <em>that</em>, maybe you should just offload the
whole oscillation and demodulation task onto analog electronics,
reserving the microcontroller for just control.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
