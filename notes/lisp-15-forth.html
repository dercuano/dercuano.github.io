originally from p.13 of The Lisp 1.5 Programmer’s Manual

in M-expressions and directly write them as stack-machine code.</p>
<pre><code>\ evalquote[fn;x] = apply[fn;x;NIL]
:EN$;
\ apply[fn;x;a] = [atom[fn] -&gt; [eq[fn;CAR] -&gt; caar[x];

<p>This amounts to 54 characters for these four lines.  Proceeding more
or less in this way, the 21 lines of code from the Lisp manual should
be about 280 characters, or about four lines.  The non-Lisp primitives
used here are taken from StoneKnifeForth, largely from Forth, and the
meanings of the characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:</code> defines a (one-byte) label as a function entry point;</li>
<li><code>;</code> returns from the current function;</li>
<li><code>!</code> stores NOS (next-to-top-of-stack) at the address in TOS
  (top-of-stack), popping both;</li>
<li><code>@</code> fetches the value at the address in TOS, replacing it as TOS;</li>
<li><code>[</code> pops TOS and conditionally jumps to the matching <code>]</code> if it was
  zero, thus enclosing a conditional;</li>
<li><code>=</code> pops TOS and NOS and pushes a value that is zero unless they
  were equal;</li>
<li>literal numbers push themselves on the stack;</li>
</ul>
<p>StoneKnifeForth defines 21 such primitives.</p>
<p>The other characters used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>r</code>, <code>x</code>, and <code>f</code> are presumed to be elsewhere-defined addresses of
  memory cells that we can use for convenient storage of parameters
  <code>r</code>, <code>x</code>, and <code>fn</code> respectively — recursive calls, however, may need
  to explicitly save and restore such things on a Forth stack;</li>
<li><code>E</code> represents <code>evalquote</code>, and <code>$</code> represents <code>apply</code> (after its
  meaning in Haskell, I suppose);</li>
<li><code>A</code> is <code>car</code>, <code>D</code> is <code>cdr</code>, and <code>k</code> is <code>cons</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can implement the A (CAR) and D (CDR) operations with something
like the following, presuming labels <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> pointing to
appropriately-sized arrays in which to store the car and cdr pointers
themselves:</p>
<pre><code>:Ac+@;
:Dd+@;
</code></pre>
<p>My recollection from doing this in C in 2007
<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/kragen-hacks@canonical.org/msg00164.html">https://www.mail-archive.com/kragen-hacks@canonical.org/msg00164.html</a>
is that there are a fair number of other things you need to implement
that are sort of hidden under the covers here: input parsing, output
printing, atom interning, memory management, call/return (“activation
record management”, as I said), and error handling.  The C version was
154 lines of code that worked, plus another nonworking 23 lines of
code for garbage collection, for a total of probably about 177 lines.
Of that, 40 lines of C was devoted to the 21 lines of code from the
Lisp 1.5 metacircular interpreter which could maybe be compressed down
to 4 lines (284 characters) of line-noise stack code.  If the same
ratios held, the whole working Lisp would be 1254 characters of stack
code, which is about 20 lines; 15–25 lines is probably a reasonable
estimate, or maybe 45 lines if it’s formatted to be as readable as
possible.</p>
<p>It might be a somewhat better idea to do a simple Scheme, Lua, or
Smalltalk instead, with proper lexical scoping, instead of the
dynamic-scoping early-bound mistake that was 1960s Lisp.  There’s no
reason to expect that they’ll be much more code, but if they are,
1960s Lisp might be good enough.</p>
<p>Something like this is probably a reasonable way to bring up a more or
less high-level language in a fairly minimal amount of code.  This
provides the following estimate for the part of the abstraction ladder
to get to a high-level programming environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>158 lines of Verilog: a CPU like the J1a;</li>
<li>132 lines of quasi-Forth: a quasi-Forth compiler to native code like
  StoneKnifeForth;</li>
<li>198 lines of Python or similar: a bootstrap interpreter to run it to
  get the initial native code, as in StoneKnifeForth;</li>
<li>45 lines of code like the above: a high-level programming language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: 533 lines of code.</p>
<p>(Maybe 90 lines is a better estimate for the Lisp part.)</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t include operating systems, filesystems, text
editors, fonts, font rendering, networking, Verilog logic synthesis,
and so on.  But it’s a start.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
