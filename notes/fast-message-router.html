(15 minutes)</div><p>Suppose you have a bunch of small processes, like the size of httpdito
(which uses 12k or 16k of memory maps XXX no it has more memory maps than that), running and sending requests,
responses, and change notifications to each other.  How fast could
they reasonably do this?</p>
<p>I wrote this test called syscallovh.c to get a ballpark:</p>
<pre><code>  char c[s];
  int fd = open(devzero, O_RDONLY);
  if (fd &lt; 0) {
    perror(devzero);
    return 1;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    read(fd, c, s);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>It finds that, on my current laptop (Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU N3700 @
1.60GHz under Linux debian 4.4.0-21-generic), a system call takes
about 300 ns, and bulk-copying bytes into userspace takes about 171 ps
per byte, or, let’s say, 175 ns per kibibyte.  This suggests that, to
keep the system call overhead under 10%, we need IPC message buffers
to usually be in the neighborhood of 16 kibibytes or bigger.  Such a
bufferful of data should take 300 ns + 16 * 175 ns = 3.1 μs to
process.</p>
<p>The sample CoAP request from Appendix A of RFC 7252, the CoAP RFC, is
16 bytes long (0.01 GET /temperature MID=0x7d34) and it receives an
11-byte response (2.05 Content "22.3 C" MID=0x7d34), so sending it
through a Linux system call by itself incurs about 100× overhead: 300
ns for the system call plus 2.7 ns to transmit the actual request,
plus a comparable amount of work for each of the three steps where the
server receives the request, the server sends a response, and the
client receives the response, a total of 1.2 μs.  A buffer of 1024
such requests or responses, by contrast, would require 3.1 μs, or
3.1 ns per request — 12.4 ns per request for the full request-response
cycle.  This would allow my four-core laptop, naïvely, to handle 32
million request/response pairs per second, or 500 000 request/response
pairs per 60Hz screen refresh.</p>
<p>As some kind of comparison, on a machine similar to this, httpdito can
serve (and ab can measure) an HTTP request in about 50 μs, which takes
about 2700–3200 instructions in the spawned child process and 29
instructions in the parent process, plus some unknown amount of work
in the kernel on its behalf, which is actually the great bulk of the
execution time.</p>
<p>As another comparison, here’s the usual dumb fibonacci microbenchmark:</p>
<pre><code>fib(n) { return n &lt; 2 ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); }
</code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, this takes 920 ms to calculate that fib(40) is
165580141, running 2,288,656,125 instructions (2.49 billion per
second), which works out to 5.6 ns per leaf call.  There are almost
exactly twice as many total calls as there are leaf calls, so this is
2.8 ns per function call and return, or 6.9 instructions per function
call and return.</p>
<p>This is probably an unusually serial benchmark.  One core of the
machine can presumably run about 4 billion instructions per second
with more typical levels of ILP, giving these crude ballpark numbers:</p>
<pre><code>| task                           |    ns |  insns | reqs | insns/req |
|--------------------------------+-------+--------+------+-----------|
| syscall/ret                    |   300 |   1200 |    0 |    1200/0 |
| 4 syscall/rets                 |  1200 |   4800 |    1 |      4800 |
| httpdito HTTP txn              | 50000 | 200000 |    1 |    200000 |
| 1024-req buffer 4 syscall/rets | 12400 |  49600 | 1024 |   48.4375 |
#+TBLFM: $3=$2*4::$5=$3/$4
</code></pre>
<p>(It’s amusing that the kernel is presumably running about 200 000
instructions while being scripted by httpdito running about 3000
instructions.)</p>
<p>Perhaps for messages sent over a network, this enormous
microsecond-scale overhead of computation per request/response pair is
unavoidable, but for processes on a single machine, it seems like it
should be avoidable.  A message broker that accepts buffers full of
messages from other processes, copies the messages around
appropriately to other processes, and sends the buffers off to the
other processes should be able to cost somewhere between the 48
instructions per message that copying them minimally costs and the
4800 instructions per message that the kernel charges us for more or
less the same job.  If we could manage 512 instructions per message,
for example, that would be 128 ns, several times faster than doing a
couple of system calls per message.  This would scale down to pieces
of work as small as 32–64 function call/return pairs, and be efficient
for pieces of work as small as 512 call/return pairs.</p>
<p>(Even across a network, if each node has a message broker talking to
other message brokers across the network, it may be feasible to reduce
the overhead; alternatively, zero-copy networking hardware may be able
to store incoming packets directly into the message buffers of waiting
processes.)</p>
<p>For communications topologies that change much less often than
messages are sent over them, such as with flow-based programming, Unix
pipelines, or farming work out to worker threads, no message broker
would be needed to amortize per-system-call overhead over many
messages.</p>
<p>What might such a protocol look like?</p>
<p>You probably want the messages to have an 8-byte-aligned fixed-length
header with a length field counted in 8-byte units, rather than the
bytes used by 0MQ and CoAP.  You need to be able to have thousands of
outstanding requests at a time, which probably requires you to be able
to accept results out of order.  You probably want your header fields
to be either single bits or entire bytes in order to avoid the need
for extra shift instructions.</p>
<p>You probably don’t want per-message authentication and encryption, not
only because it impedes routing but also because it takes too long.
In <a href="https://cr.yp.to/highspeed/coolnacl-20120725.pdf">The security impact of a new cryptographic library</a> in 2012,
Bernstein, Lange, and Schwabe report that NaCl can run 80 000
public-key authenticated encryption or authenticated decryption
operations per second an a 6-core 3.3GHz AMD Phenom II X6 1100T, which
is presumably in the ballpark of 750 000 instructions per operation.
The paper mentions a faster interface consisting of
crypto_box_beforenm, crypto_box_afternm, and crypto_box_open_afternm,
which allows you to amortize the expensive public-key operations
across many messages to or from the same correspondent.</p>
<p>However, even the <a href="https://bench.cr.yp.to/results-stream.html">ChaCha20 stream cipher used by NaCl needs 5.6 clock
cycles per byte for a 64-byte message</a> on an AMD Ryzen 7 1700 at
3GHz, working out to 128 ns per message.  So per-message
authentication and encryption could conceivably be affordable, but it
will probably use more CPU time than the message routing would.</p>
<p>It’s crucially important that, if there are message brokers, whatever
transformation they must do need not examine every byte in the
message, including in particular breaking the 8-byte alignment
guarantee as they copy the message from an input buffer to its
appropriate output buffer or buffers.</p>
<p>Messages should probably normally be in the range of 16 bytes (smaller
messages will have space only for the 8-byte header!) to 512 bytes
(significantly larger messages will probably gain no further
efficiency), with 128 bytes being the normal case.  A single-byte
length field would support messages up to 2048 bytes.</p>
<p>So, a single message might contain a datum of a level of detail such
as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the above example request or response about temperature</li>
<li>a 512-byte disk sector (although maybe in the age of 3D XPoint
  memory, user processes should be interacting directly with durable
  memory rather than indirecting their access to it through kernels
  and servers)</li>
<li>a 16×16 pixel RGBA tile (1024 bytes)</li>
<li>part or all of a scan line of pixels (2048 bytes in RGBA is 512
  pixels; in 16-bit RGB, it’s 1024 pixels; in 8-bit grayscale, it’s
  2048 pixels; in 1-bit monochrome, it’s 16384 pixels)</li>
<li>a rendered glyph from a font (some of the glyphs on my screen right
  now are 20×34, 12×17, 7×9, 12×9, and 7×7, thus ranging from 49
  pixels up to 680 pixels; some mainstream fonts have glyphs as small
  as 5×7, and I've designed a proportional 6-pixel-tall font with some
  2×6 glyphs)</li>
<li>a millisecond or two of PCM audio; at DAT quality this is 192 bytes</li>
<li>a drawing command</li>
<li>a Merkle tree node with 4–32 SHA-256 hashes</li>
<li>32 single-precision floating-point numbers from one column of some
  table</li>
<li>a touch, keystroke, or mouse event</li>
<li>a SQL query</li>
<li>a SQL table row</li>
<li>the log message for an HTTP request</li>
<li>a Redis query or response</li>
<li>a line of text (but ideally not a letter, word, paragraph, page, or
  document)</li>
<li>a 128-node binary DAG with two bytes per node and 128 implicit leaf
  nodes</li>
<li>an AST of some 64 nodes with up to 192 implicit leaf nodes</li>
<li>the bytecode for a method to be compiled or the machine-code
  compilation result</li>
<li>a B-tree node containing 32–128 child node pointers, 64 bits each,
  with or without keys</li>
<li>an SNMP request or response</li>
<li>a Git commit, but probably not an entire Git commit history.</li>
<li>a Git tree entry such as “100755 blob
  b734283e0473b9d77f07efee066f1486a1c5a37f wifiscan.py”, but probably
  not an entire Git tree.</li>
<li>a Tweet</li>
<li>an SMS</li>
<li>a financial transaction</li>
<li>a stock price update</li>
<li>a compilation command</li>
</ul>
<p>It probably makes sense to layer some kind of application-layer
protocol defining semantics (routing, failure recovery, naming,
request-reply, publish-subscribe, caching) on top of a base data
representation layer.</p>
<h2>Many-output computations</h2>
<p>Thinking about how to wedge a “give me the 16×16 RGB tile (768 bytes)
at (112, 144) from frame 1832 of foo.mp4” service into a cached RESTful
architecture makes me question the idea of caching individual message
responses to achieve efficiency.  Computing the tile in question, or
even an approximation of it, is going to require decoding a
potentially large area of the previous several frames, possibly up to
a few seconds’ worth of video.  I’m not sure if it’s feasible to break
that computation down into pieces whose outputs would fit into a
single 2048-byte message so they could be cached, but it certainly
isn’t the easiest way to bring existing video decoders into the
system.</p>
<p>However, if instead of “give me the 16×16 RGB tile (768 bytes) at
(112, 144) from frame 1832 of foo.mp4”, you instead request “please
store the next few frames following frame 1770 of foo.mp4 at
/some/place”, the video codec could issue a few hundred thousand PUT
requests to store its output, and then we could fetch those outputs.</p>
<p>A similar kind of thing happens with, say, a drawing that gets
rendered to a high resolution set of pixels — in the extreme case, the
drawing is some view of the OpenStreetMap database.  If we move one of
the lines in the image, naïvely, that invalidates every tile of the
cached image.  To avoid invalidating the whole cached image, you need
some kind of intermediate layer that efficiently partitions the
drawing elements into those that affect different bounding boxes, then
makes the individual pixel tiles depend only on the subset drawn
within their bounding box.  This seems feasible, but still tricky.</p>
<h2>High-bandwidth computations</h2>
<p>Copying a byte into or out of a user process may take only 171 ps of
one core, which suggests that you could do 23 gigabytes per second on
this laptop, or 11.7 gigabytes per second out one process and into
another.  That’s pretty decent bandwidth; 1920×1080×60Hz×4bytes is
only 498 megabytes per second.  But that bandwidth gets divided by the
number of intermediary processes it ends up flowing through.</p>
<p>Still, this seems like it should be okay.</p>
<h2>Low-latency computations</h2>
<p>One of my examples above is “a millisecond or two of PCM audio”.  For
media playback applications like watching a movie with bae, fairly
high latency is acceptable as long as you have enough buffer to even
out the jitter.  But, if you’re building a synthesizer out of a bunch
of processes piping PCM audio to each other, <a href="http://superpowered.com/androidaudiopathlatency">even 10 milliseconds of
audio latency is intolerable</a>.</p>
<p>Buffering a millisecond of audio is not bad.  Earlier today I <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/sweetdreams">wrote a
softsynth in C++ to make the sound of the synthesizer in Eurythmics’
<em>Sweet Dreams</em></a>.  It has 29 very-low-level processing nodes in an
11-level-deep DAG, all of which are stateless and use continuous time.
If they were being called upon to generate a millisecond of audio
(192 bytes at DAT quality) we would expect sending that millisecond to
require 300 ns + 192 * 171 ps = 330 ns at each node, plus another
330 ns on the node that received it; all 29 would take a total of
19 μs of system call overhead.  The current C++ implementation spends
about 20 μs generating that millisecond of audio, but 90+% of that is
in method invocation overhead (including virtual method dispatch),
because each node is generating a single sample instead of 48 samples.</p>
<p>(Some of the nodes are invoked more than once; there’s a seven-node
sawtooth C3 note subgraph that’s used at two different times by the
flanger, and a five-node triangle-wave C2 note subgraph that’s both
used to amplitude-modulate the flanged signal and added to the final
mix, and the identity function is a single node that’s used in six
places.  So this count of 29 is slightly low.  Compiling the node
graph into JS reveals 45 operations, but 15 of those are the identity
function and could perhaps be skipped; another couple are redundant
constant evaluations.  So I think 29 is in the ballpark.)</p>
<p>So this approach, with a single millisecond of latency, would impose
an order-of-magnitude overhead on soft-real-time audio-processing
applications, but would still be almost two orders of magnitude more
performant than necessary in this case.</p>
<p>In fact, it would not even be fatal if these messages were enqueued in
a message broker between each node behind a 16-kibibyte buffer of
other data.  If each of the 9 levels of the tree cost 3.1 μs of
bufferbloat, the total would be 27 μs of message-broker bufferbloat
latency, less than the 39 μs of CPU usage to get all those tiny
messages in and out of all those tiny processes; the total would be
66 μs, or 6.6% of the millisecond.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
