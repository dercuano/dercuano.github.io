(7 minutes)</div><p>Comparison sorting is O(N log N) in the best case, using one of the
standard sorts (mergesort, quicksort, heapsort, binary search trees,
library sort, or a variant of one of these).  In large datasets, the
log N factor can reach 20 or 30, which represents a significant
slowdown.  But often people are comparison-sorting because they want
the top M items: top 1, 10, 20, 30, or 100, say.  Surprisingly,
getting the top 100 items can be done in linear time (O(N)) using
quickselect!</p>
<p>Quickselect is a version of quicksort that recurses only on one
partition.  If you have a million items, the first pass will examine
all million of them; the second pass will examine, typically, half a
million; the third pass typically a quarter million; and so on, until
the 30th pass examines just one item.  (I think there’s a little bit
of a fudge factor, as with quicksort, which uses 1.39 N log N
comparisons on average; but I will ignore that for the moment.)  This
adds up to just under two million compares and half that many swaps.</p>
<p>When quickselect is done, each of the pivot elements it chose,
including its final result, partitions the array into items smaller
and larger than itself.  So to get the top 100 elements, it is
sufficient to invoke quickselect to select the 100th element, and then
take the first 100 elements of the reordered array.</p>
<h2>The paradoxical complexity of sorting the top N</h2>
<p>This has a sort of paradoxical result.  Suppose you have 256 elements
and you want the top 64 of them.  Quickselect can give you this top-64
result in about 512 comparisons and 256 swaps.  But now if you want to
comparison-sort <em>just those 64 elements</em>, so that you get the top 64
in order, you need 1.39 N log N comparisons, which is 534 comparisons,
more than it took to find that top-quartile in the first place!</p>
<p>This gets worse as the problem size gets bigger, if we hold the
quantile fixed.  If you have four billion elements and you want the
top quartile, you can get them in 8 billion compares, but fully
sorting that top quartile will take you 42 billion compares, five
times longer.  At that scale, even the top eighth is faster to find
than to sort fully once you find it.</p>
<h2>Improving quickselect average-case time for extreme order statistics</h2>
<p>Median-of-median is a way to improve quickselect’s worst-case time
(from quadratic to linear), but we can also improve the constant
factor of the linear average-case time with one weird trick.  Using a
variant of the median-of-3 pivot approach, you can improve
quickselect’s linear-time average case by up to a factor of 2 by
better pivot selection, especially when you’re looking for a fairly
extreme order statistic.</p>
<p>The improvement is limited to a factor of 2 because vanilla
quickselect does less than 2 comparisons per element to start with,
and computing an order statistic exactly will require examining each
element at least once.</p>
<p>You do this by picking a first-step pivot that has a high probability
of reducing the next step by as much as possible.  For example, if
you’re looking for the 0.1% quantile of a billion items, you can
sample 2000 candidate pivots and take, say, the 0.2% quantile from
them (using about 4000 comparisons if you just use regular
quickselect), which is very likely to partition the billion-item list
into a very large list that does not contain the candidate item and a
very small one (only about two million items) that does contain it.
This reduces the problem size from the first step to the second step
by a factor of 500 instead of a factor of 2, and so you will need on
average only 1.004004 comparisons per element out of the billion
rather than almost 2 comparisons per element.</p>
<p>This approach can, of course, be applied recursively, both in the
pivot-selection step and on the reduced-size problem.</p>
<p>Also, since this approach depends on the position of the desired
element within the reduced window, it may work to improve
quickselect’s performance significantly even for non-extreme order
statistics.  For example, if you’re seeking the median, and your
first-step pivot turns out to be very close to the median, then what
was originally the median becomes an extreme order statistic in the
first recursive call.  Perhaps you’re seeking the median of a million
items, and your initial pivot turns out to be element #499000.  Now
the value you are seeking is element 1000 out of the 501000 you’re
selecting from in the next recursive call.  With this approach, you
can sample 500 or so candidate pivots, and probably manage to reduce
your problem size down to about 2000 elements in the next step, ending
up needing only about 1 506 000 comparisons (I think) rather than the
nearly 2 million you would need with vanilla quickselect.</p>
<p>The expected improvement factor on any step is limited to about the
square root of the number of elements.  That’s because finding a pivot
to reduce the interval by some factor F is going to require selecting
it from somewhere around F candidate pivots.  (I’ve used 2F in the
examples above; I don’t know if 2 is the optimal factor.)  But once
you’re examining more candidate pivots than the number of elements you
expect to have remaining after partitioning with the pivot, you’re not
winning any more; you’re losing.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the optimal number of candidate pivots to consider
is, and I'm also not sure about the optimal size of the range to try
to consider.  It seems like you’d want to have great assurance,
generally, that your small range is big enough to include your target
element in it, because otherwise you’ve just squandered an entire pass
over the input data.  As the desired order statistic wanders toward
the median, though, the loss from such a miss diminishes, and the
potential gain becomes smaller.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
