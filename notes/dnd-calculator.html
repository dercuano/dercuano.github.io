<p>I wrote an RPN calculator in DHTML, and it runs on my iPhone, but it
isn’t very usable.  One problem is that it’s misidentifying some
keypresses (apparently shiftKey is false when you press the <code>*</code> on the
on-screen keyboard on both Android and iPhone, but the keyCode is the
same as <code>8</code>, and so <code>*</code> comes out as <code>8</code>, because I was too dumb to
use a library) but it has bigger problems.  The keyboard eats up a lot
of the screen real estate; predictive text like Swype is totally
incompatible with instant feedback; you have to switch keyboard modes
to get to different operators; there are no arrow keys, much less a
Ctrl key to use with the arrow keys; and pressing the wrong key is
common, so undoing an error needs to be extra easy.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the issue is that command keys are a bad idea on these
touchscreens.  They have the usual problems with command keys (they’re
not discoverable, not selectively available and thus invisibly modal)
but also the touchscreen offers very poor precision for keypressing.
Instead, it’s optimized for dragging, and pointing at things.  You
could use keys (ideally transparent ones!) for data input, but you
probably shouldn't use them for editing.</p>
<p>I think you can usually get about 6 rows of about 4 buttons on a
cellphone touchscreen, so a keypress can convey about 5 bits of
information.  But a drag stop can typically indicate a position to
about 8 bits of horizontal precision and 8 bits of vertical precision,
or 7 bits each easily — with the caveat that you can't see what the
fuck is under your finger.</p>
<p>The ideal drag-and-drop behavior of mouse-driven systems is that, when
you start dragging a thing that can be dropped in places, the places
it can be dropped will light up, and in some cases emerge from
invisibility, in order for the user to be able to discover them.  Then
you can carefully position the dragged item over the drop target and
release it.  If a given on-screen object wants to support several
different actions from having the same thing dropped on it, those
different things need to be different drop targets, perhaps positioned
in active zones around it, which can become active only when a drag is
in progress.  Your drop action is the utterance of an RDF triple: the
subject, perhaps, is the dragged item; the object is the object from
which the drop target emerged; and your choice of drop target — a
delta vector between the drop position and the object of your
utterance — provides the verb.</p>
<p>(Naked Objects pioneered this approach to method invocation for
business data processing UIs.)</p>
<p>A problem with this on a small screen is that your drop targets need
to be damned big for you to be able to see them around your finger,
which means you can't have very many of them.  Maybe you can
dynamically zoom drawers or things as you drag around in order to
effectively get more screen real estate, but man.  So much loss.</p>
<p>One possible fix to this would be to have the “drop targets” emerge
from the <em>object being dragged</em> rather than the stationary object;
they can protrude in all directions from under your finger, sort of
like a pie menu.</p>
<p>In the calculator case, perhaps you have a number 314 and a number 100
that you would like to combine:</p>
<pre><code>314          100
</code></pre>
<p>If you start dragging the 100 around, binary operators can begin to
protrude from it, while the 314 lights up as a potential target:</p>
<pre><code>            ^ * |
31⃝4        - 100 +
            , ÷ &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>and if you position one of those operators over the 314, it will light
up; if you then release your touch, the two numbers can combine into a
new formula.  You can take advantage of the precision of dragging in
order to unambiguously select the 314 as the target; if it is embedded
in a compound formula, that formula might magnify as you approach it
in order to reduce collisions.</p>
<p>Of course, if you could manage to drop the 100 directly on the 314,
you could then pop up a pie menu of binary operators, but this seems
both more cumbersome and less discoverable.</p>
<p>A different approach, taking advantage of the possibilities for
multitouch interaction afforded by modern touchscreens, would be to
use two separate fingers for different things, instead of a single
drag-and-drop gesture.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/hci.html">Human–computer interaction</a> (76 notes)
