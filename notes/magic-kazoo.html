(6 minutes)</div><p>I thought I must have written about this in detail elsewhere, but I
can’t find it.</p>
<p>I propose the Magic Kazoo, an electronic musical instrument.  You use
it by putting it in your mouth and singing into it; the pitch, volume,
airflow, and tonal quality of your voice, together with buttons on it,
control a synthesizer running on one or more microcontrollers to
produce music emitted from a built-in speaker.  With live looping, you
are a one-man band.</p>
<h2>Real-time audio synthesis is no longer power-hungry</h2>
<p>Modern microcontrollers — even MSP430s and AVRs, but especially the
ARM Cortex-M series — are powerful enough to do real-time audio
synthesis easily, even running on tiny batteries.  We should expect
the vast majority of the power consumed by the Magic Kazoo to be the
power dissipated in its speaker.</p>
<h2>Pitch detection can be super simple; amplitude detection may be harder</h2>
<p>Your voice recorded on a microphone that is actually inside your mouth
is enough to saturate just about any normal microphone, and it’s
reasonably sinusoidal, so you can get the frequency just by counting
zero-crossings.  You can’t get the amplitude in the usual way, because
it’s totally saturated and does a pretty good impression of a square
wave.  You may still have 200–500μs or so in between saturated
positive and saturated negative, though, and the slope in that 500μs
(or equivalently its length) kind of tells you what the amplitude of
the whole sine wave would be if you could record it.</p>
<p>Given that, you can detect sound onsets with amplitude,
measure the frequency with time between zero crossings, round to the
nearest halfstep, and control a softsynth.  Maybe you can use the
inferred volume contour of the sound to give you further control over
the sound.</p>
<h2>Even ceramic capacitors might be adequate microphones in such extreme circumstances</h2>
<p>(The power of the sound is such that you might be able to use things
that you wouldn’t normally use as microphones.  Like
<a href="https://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/b/precisionhub/archive/2014/12/19/stress-induced-outbursts-microphonics-in-ceramic-capacitors-part-1">high-barium-titanate ceramic capacitors</a>, which are a lot cheaper,
and which <a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/128892/quantifying-the-piezoelectric-effect-of-ceramic-capacitors">can sometimes generate over 100mV</a> piezoelectrically, or
even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFCRB4d991E">over two volts when Dave Jones bangs them on wood like
drumsticks</a>.)</p>
<h2>Interfaces to the outside world</h2>
<p>Aside from the speaker, it has a headphone jack.</p>
<h3>Should air pass through it?</h3>
<p>Since you can breathe through your nose,
it doesn’t need to have air pass through it, and if you
take that option, you can make music for yourself or a headphone
listener by humming quietly.  This does remove the possibility of
controlling a dimension of the music with airflow, though.</p>
<h3>Sliders, knobs, and buttons</h3>
<p>In addition to the continuously-variable frequency and amplitude
inputs from your voice, the possible continuously-variable spirometry
input, and the possibility of maybe detecting other aspects of your
vocal-cavity resonances, the Magic Kazoo probably needs some further
controls.  The variety of things you <em>might</em> want to control are
endless: adjusting the volume, selecting from thousands of existing
instrument sounds, recording a pattern to loop later, enabling or
disabling existing patterns, starting or stopping a canned beat-box
rhythm, adjusting tempo, and any of the endless variety of effects
pedals out there; and if you’re using it to construct your own virtual
instruments, you could start with adjusting attack, decay, sustain,
and release, recording samples, autotuning them, and then selecting
what part of the sample gets used, generating sounds from systems like
Karplus-Strong and FM synthesis, and so on.</p>
<p>There is, however, a very limited amount of space available on a
kazoo-sized thing for the full set of controls you might want on a
digital audio workstation, and even less screen space for feedback.  I
have this little 8-color ballpoint pen here that’s about the right
size; as mentioned in <a href="../notes/phase-change-soldering-iron.html">A phase-change soldering iron</a>, it’s 17 mm
in diameter and 130 mm long.  The eight colors are selected by eight
sliders somewhat like the digit inputs on a Curta calculator, which
slide about 25 mm; things that are more closely spaced than that
probably aren’t too practical, and even those might be pushing it — I
can’t move two adjacent sliders at once because my fingers are too
big.  So controls need to be at least 13 mm apart to be simultaneously
operable.</p>
<p>For such a device, there are strong incentives in favor of capacitive
touch sensing instead of physical buttons: moving parts break,
especially on instruments played by children; physical buttons tend to
let water in, which is a problem for an instrument normally partly
immersed in saliva; the higher parts count and extra assembly steps
for physical buttons raise the cost; and physical buttons are
generally limited to detecting contact or non-contact, with no analog
levels, until you go to potentiometers (which really exacerbate the
other three factors).  But normal touch sensing is kind of a no-go for
a musical instrument, because it generally requires looking at the
thing and responding to what you see, which adds far too much
cognitive latency.  It’s <em>really</em> important to be able to find
controls with your fingers before you activate them.</p>
<p>A possible solution is to expose the touch surfaces through holes in a
touchable template, which allows you to find the “button” or “slider”
hole you want by feel alone, then use a bit more pressure to squeeze
your finger skin through the hole so it touches the surface.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
