(1 minute)</div><p>The traditional way to compose the graphical things that make up
fonts, whether as outlines or as strokes, is to concatenate sequences
of lines, arcs, and Bézier curves.</p>
<p>I’ve thought about alternatives including decomposing those shapes
into splines and sine waves.  Now it occurs to me that maybe CIC
filters would also be a reasonable kind of way to decompose those
shapes.</p>
<p>The idea is that the path of a paintbrush painting the letter is some
kind of f(t) = (x, y) parametric curve, and CIC filters are capable of
producing fairly interesting parametric curves at pretty low
computational expense.  Maybe stroke width should also be part of it.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
