(7 minutes)</div><p>You should be able to oxidize things that are difficult to oxidize
using a rapidly cooled air plasma, and this should be feasible even
without refractory electrodes and at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<h2>The basic principle</h2>
<p>If you convert a gas into a hot electric plasma between two
electrodes, then cool the plasma rapidly to the gas’s original
temperature, the cooled plasma will still be different from the
original gas in several ways: its molecule energies will still be far
from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, as it will still have a
significant number of very hot molecules and free electrons
(this is called an “anisothermal plasma”); many of the molecules will
still be ionized; many of the non-ionized molecules will have excited
electrons; and, if it’s not a noble gas, many of the molecules will
have been ripped apart, and some will have reformed in new
conformations.  In particular, if the source contained O₂, the
resulting gas will also contain O and O₃, which are very strong
oxidizers, and if it contained O₂ and N₂, it will also contain a
variety of nitrogen oxides, some of which are also very strong
oxidizers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonthermal_plasma">Wikipedia's nonthermal plasma article tells
me</a> that the oxygen
atoms have a lifetime of about 14 μs.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Directing a stream of air, converted to this cool plasma, against a
material that should have an excellent chance of oxidizing it further,
if it's not already fully oxidized with oxygen or something stronger,
without necessarily setting it on fire or even heating it much, and
volatilizing some of the oxide, which could be useful for a variety of
purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>removing organic contaminants from oxide surfaces, such as calcite,
  clay, concrete, glass, sapphire, or viridian, including the glass,
  sapphire, and viridian passivating layers formed naturally on
  silicon, aluminum, chromium, and stainless steel surfaces in air;</li>
<li>metal passivation, including selective thickening of passivation
  layers, including on iron;</li>
<li>selective functionalization of organic surfaces;</li>
<li>selective production of oxidation products on organic surfaces — in
  some cases, for example, this can be used to make a dark mark,
  making the device a printer;</li>
<li>low-temperature cutting of materials whose oxides are volatile,
  including any organic material (other than teflon), graphite,
  diamond, zinc, and possibly even silicon carbide, molybdenum, iron,
  and steel (certainly at higher temperatures where the oxide will
  melt and can be blown off);</li>
<li>acquiring trace amounts of volatilized oxides and nitrides for
  spectroscopic analysis;</li>
<li>gasifying an oxidizable blowing agent from a matrix without heating
  it excessively, producing a foam, as in the traditional means of
  producing firebrick by burning organic material out of the pores of
  a matrix;</li>
<li>sterilizing drinking water or solid objects, especially solid
  objects that would be damaged by high temperatures, although maybe
  you should see if an ordinary ozone generator without plasma jets
  would be adequate (I see that this is currently under
  investigation for food processing);</li>
<li>selective oxidative polymerization of, for example, linseed oil,
  tung oil, or stand oil, for example for 3-D printing, for 2-D
  printing with the polymer as a binder, or for depositing resists to
  guide later etching — and polymerizing almost any energetically
  favorable monomer should be possible at the right temperature,
  perhaps including polymerizing aqueous silicic acid into silica gel,
  as plasma polymerization is already used to form films of
  polystyrene, polyethylene, and poly(methyl methacrylate), among
  others, though normally from low-pressure gas-phase monomers;</li>
<li>curing linseed-oil or stand-oil finishes very quickly;</li>
<li>very rapid selective polymerization of cyanoacrylate by selectively
  adding hydroxyl radicals, although maybe ordinary water vapor is a
  better way to do this;</li>
<li>oxidizing hazardous organic chemicals such as mustard gas, PCBs,
  benz(a)pyrene, and possibly-unknown mixtures into tamer and simpler
  oxides that can be more easily disposed of;</li>
<li>cutting composites made of oxide grains cemented together with
  a carbon or organic binder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible applications of non-air plasma ingredients include
surface-nitriding metals and
selectively “salt-glazing” silicate ceramics with a part-sodium
plasma, or superpassivating surfaces that need to withstand exposure
to strong oxidants by using a part-fluorine plasma.  If the sodium
source is chlorine-free (for example, NaOH or NaNO₃), the chlorine and
HCl emissions that plague salt-glazing will not occur.</p>
<h2>Directing the plasma</h2>
<p>If the stream is sufficiently cool, its rate of erosion of
already-oxidized materials such as teflon, soda-lime glass, iron
oxides, quartz, viridian, sapphire, zircon, or zirconia should be
relatively low, so it might be feasible to use a nozzle made from
these materials to direct it onto the workpiece without eroding the
nozzle too rapidly.</p>
<h2>Cooling the plasma</h2>
<p>Rapidly cooling of the plasma that has just passed through the arc can
be effected by misting water into the plasma.  The water will flash to
steam, some of which will itself ionize and dissociate, contributing
further reactive oxygen species to the mix.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might be able to use corona discharge to ionize
enough of the air to be useful, without ever heating it to arcing
temperatures — maybe like a garden-variety ozone generator with more
concentrated output and maybe gold-plated or carbon points for longer
life.</p>
<h2>Liquid electrodes</h2>
<p>Optionally, the electrodes themselves can be covered with a constantly
replenished liquid electrolyte, such as water including a substantial
mixture of NaOH or KOH, or molten NaNO₃ or KNO₃.  This avoids the need
for electrodes of refractory materials such a graphite, silicon
carbide, tungsten, or hafnium.  Some of the electrolyte will find its
way into the arc, which may be preferable to the evaporation from
solid refractory electrodes under some circumstances.</p>
<p>(Why don’t potters just use chlorine-free sources for salt-glazing in
a kiln?  NaOH and NaNO₃ convert to NaO at high temperatures, which
doesn’t boil until 1950°, much higher than NaCl’s 1413°, so a pottery
kiln at 1100°–1200° has a hard time volatilizing the sodium from NaOH
or NaNO₃ without an admixture of the lower-boiling NaCl, while the arc
should have no trouble.  However, they <em>do</em> use NaCO₃ and NaHCO₃ for
“soda firing”, sprayed into the kiln during firing, so I don’t know.)</p>
<h2>Hazardous emissions</h2>
<p>However, if made from air, the cooled plasma inevitably contains
sufficient ROSes and nitrogen oxides to be hazardous; the resulting
gas needs to be thoroughly reduced unless you’re doing this at a very
small scale somewhere adequately ventilated.  The standard approach to
this problem is a platinum catalytic converter, but maybe bubbling the
gas through consumable linseed oil or passing it over a consumable bed
of sulfur, phosphorus, powdered lanthanoids, or really any easily
oxidized chemical would be adequate.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
