(13 minutes)</div><p>I was thinking about how to generalize the arithmetic-computer device
Sutherland mentions in his Sketchpad thesis, and I came up with an
architecture presumably less powerful than an FPGA but maybe easier to
program and simpler to implement.  Preliminary calculations suggest
that it might be capable of FPGA-like performance on DSP-like
problems.</p>
<h2>A 4×4 synchronous crossbar switch</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a block with 4 16-bit inputs and 4 16-bit outputs,
which outputs are driven by clocked registers attached to 4-way muxes.
You can configure the 4 4-way muxes with 8 bits of topology
configuration data.  This allows each of the output ports to receive
the input from any of the four input ports on each clock cycle.  This
can achieve not only any of the 24 permutations of the 4 input words,
but also 232 more configurations which discard some inputs and
duplicate others.</p>
<p>It looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>→→-X---X---X---X
   |   |   |   |
→→-X---X---X---X
   |   |   |   |
→→-X---X---X---X
   |   |   |   |
→→-X---X---X---X
   |   |   |   |
   ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓
</code></pre>
<p>Here each of the "X” points is a switch which can either transmit a
signal from the input to the output, or not, according to the switch
configuration, and each of the “↓“s is an output register consisting
of 16 D flip-flops which registers the input that has been routed to
it.  An example configuration, with “+” indicating switches that are
disconnected and “#” indicating those that are connected, follows:</p>
<pre><code>→→-+---#---+---+
   |   |   |   |
→→-+---+---#---+
   |   |   |   |
→→-#---+---+---+
   |   |   |   |
→→-+---+---+---#
   |   |   |   |
   ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓
</code></pre>
<p>(With some logic families, it might be appealing to double that to 16
bits of configuration data instead of 4 and get wired-AND or wired-OR
functions between the inputs, plus a free all-zeroes or all-ones
value, depending on whether it’s AND or OR.)</p>
<p>Now suppose you have three “fully-connected layers” made of 4 such 4×4
switches; if dataflow goes from left to right, it looks something like
this:</p>
<pre><code>digraph f{rankdir=LR;node[shape=box,label=""];{1 2 3 4}-&gt;{5 6 7 8}-&gt;{9 a b c}}
</code></pre>
<p>The idea here is that each output port on a single node is connected
to a different node in the next layer, and each input port on a single
node is connected to a different node in the previous layer.  Since
the nodes are synchronous, the whole system can run at just as high a
clock speed as a single crossbar node, but with three cycles of
latency instead of one, 12 bytes of topology data instead of one, and
16 words per cycle instead of 4.</p>
<p>What may not be immediately apparent is that this simple, regular
topology is sufficient to achieve any of the 20'922'789'888'000
permutations of the 16 inputs, although not all of the
18'446'744'073'709'551'616 possible ways of assigning inputs to
outputs are represented in its 79'228'162'514'264'337'593'543'950'336
configurations, due to redundant configurations. [Proof missing.]
With only two layers this is not the case, since you can get at most
one value from a given input node to a given output node, but with
three layers you can get all four values from the same input node to
the same output node if necessary, routing them through four different
nodes in the intermediate layer.</p>
<p>Additional layers permit larger numbers of inputs and outputs, at the
cost of higher latency.  I think, but am not sure, that each two
additional layers permits a permutation of four times as many
inputs — thus, 4 inputs with 1 layer, 16 inputs with 3 layers, 64
inputs with 5 layers, 256 inputs with 7 layers, etc.</p>
<p>(I learned about this topology from the IBM SP2, but I think it
actually originated in telephone networks.  In the SP2 “high-speed
switch”, only permutations were supported, but they were created and
removed dynamically, and there was also buffering.)</p>
<p>Note that if the individual crossbar nodes are inverting and you do
the wired-AND or wired-OR trick, then you can get words of either all
zeroes or all ones out of the same network by generating them at
different levels of the network, and you can also get both wired-AND
and wired-OR, though not completely without restriction.  This can get
a wide range of bitwise functions out of the network, though not all
16 bitwise functions.</p>
<h2>Transport-triggered crossbar computation</h2>
<p>Suppose you hook up an adder to two of the outputs of the above switch
network and its output to one of the network inputs.  Supposing the
adder can operate with the same cycle time as the crossbar nodes, you
can then send it a stream of pairs of numbers to add, and the stream
of its (three-cycle-delayed) outputs becomes available as another
stream of values for the network.</p>
<p>Indeed, you could do the same with a multiplier, or a
multiply-accumulate element, with three inputs; or a bitwise XOR, or
an AND, a signed or unsigned comparator, a signed or unsigned max, or
a general ternary operator.  A barrel shifter could quite reasonably
derive several outputs from a single input, as could a more general
ALU — by simultaneously generating several functions of its two inputs
on different outputs, all connected to network inputs, the routing
configuration of the network serves to determine which output or
outputs are actually used.</p>
<p>In some cases, you might want to just connect network outputs directly
to inputs, providing a feedback path from one cycle through the
network to the next.  This can be used not just to remember a data
value, like a register in a conventional processor, but also to
accumulate results iteratively.</p>
<p>Where does the stream of input values come from?  You could imagine
configuring a memory read port as an input-output pair — an output for
the memory address and an input for the data read from the memory.  Or
you could connect the address bus to a counter and initialize the
counter by some other means, perhaps the same means used to set up the
network topology configuration.  Or, rather than a counter, you could
use a register hooked up to an adder which increments by some amount
on each cycle, in order to allow strided reads.</p>
<p>Where does the stream of output values go to?  Aside from hooking some
output ports directly to peripherals such as a DAC, you could quite
reasonably have a memory write port as well.</p>
<h2>Interleaving</h2>
<p>In the above, I’ve described both cases where the data fed back into
the network is purely a function of the network’s current
outputs — the adder, say, or the ALU, or the outputs wired to
inputs — and cases where some state is kept outside the network.  I
want to distinguish between the cases where this state is kept in RAM
and where it’s kept in some kind of register attached to the network
directly.</p>
<p>I claim that if we abjure entirely having separate registers attached
to the network, allowing only RAM and pure functions, then we can
think of the processor as a temporal interleaving of several different
processors.  If we have, say, seven cycles of latency through the
network, then we can think of it as seven virtual processors with
completely separate sets of registers; the outputs on cycle 7 are a
function of the inputs on cycle 0, the outputs on cycle 14 are a
function of the inputs on cycle 7, and so on.  They could even be
computing unrelated things if we also switch between seven different
configurations for the interconnect network on each clock cycle.
Breaking our abjuration with a one-cycle delay element — a register
external to the network — suffices to provide communication from one
virtual processor to the next.</p>
<p>This approach would suggest that we handle, for example, strided
memory access with an adder connected to a fixed value and its own
previous output, which is also routed to the memory read port, rather
than an external register that increments by the stride each cycle.</p>
<h2>Bit-serial variants</h2>
<p>If you make the nodes bit-serial instead of parallel, you lose a
factor of 16 in bandwidth.  But you gain a factor of 256 (!!) in area,
and you may also gain some bit-shifting power — suddenly a delay
element is capable of shifting a word by a bit, as for a
multiplication.</p>
<p>With this approach, it’s still likely worthwhile to interleave virtual
processors, but they’re interleaved on a bit-by-bit basis rather than
a word-by-word basis.  The replacement for a 16-bit register in a
normal processor is, rather than wiring an output directly around to
an input, a longish shift register from an output back to an input.
(If the network latency is 7 bits, for example, you need a 112-bit
shift register.)  A delay element to shift a word by a bit could
similarly be a shift register.  (A 7-bit shift register if, again,
your network latency is 7 bits.)  But you don’t need one — you can
just use a path through the network!  Doing the same thing for a
16-bit value would use up 16 inputs and outputs, though.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about bit-serial processors is that they more
comfortably accommodate processing data of arbitrary-length words than
data of fixed-length words.  Dropping the carry from an addition after
16 bits or whatever is an extra exceptional case to add, rather than
something you have to take special pains to avoid.  Also, you get
perhaps some extra use out of the elements used for addition — if you
route a 0 carry to a bitwise adder, it gives you simultaneously XOR
and (perhaps integrally delayed) AND, which you can use for other
things.</p>
<h2>Per-bit LUT</h2>
<p>One possible interesting operation for the bit-serial case is
demuxing: given four or eight bitstreams, demultiplex the values of
two or three other bitstreams to select among them.  This provides a
programmable universal Boolean function which can, if desired, vary
bit by bit.</p>
<h2>Very crude performance analysis</h2>
<p>The idea here is that you load the inner loop of your algorithm into
the configuration of the network and just let it rip for a while.
Under such circumstances, modern high-end CPUs can generally take
advantage of SIMD operations, carrying out something like 128 bit
operations per cycle.  Small microcontrollers are stuck at something
like one 32-bit payload operation every five cycles or so, so
something like six bit operations per clock cycle.</p>
<p>If you have a 256-input 256-output bit-serial network that is 7 bits
deep, you might allocate half of its lines to ALUish things, half a
dozen or so to memory, and split the other half between long shift
registers and simple loopbacks.  This gives you a max of 128 bit
operations per cycle, but maybe 64 is a more likely estimate.</p>
<p>Let’s estimate that each D flip-flop uses 6 transistors and that we
have 56 bits of FIFO on each of the 64 long-shift-register outputs,
making them more akin to 8-bit registers.  (It’s easy enough to chain
two of them together when you want a 16-bit register.)  This gives us
21504 transistors in this register file, which is a lot but not the
majority of the whole chip.  The 1792 D flip-flops in the network
itself are just 10752 transistors, and the 1792 corresponding MUXes
might be another 10752 transistors.  Then, on our 128 or so ALU lines,
we have, say, 5 NAND gates each, each with 4 transistors, for a total
of 2560 more transistors.  The total, then, is 45568 known
transistors, and if we add 50% or so for stuff I’m not thinking of,
it’s similar to the count on a 68000 or other mid-80s workstation
CPU — but clockable at very high speeds because of its very short path
length, and doing 128 bit operations per cycle instead of 6 or
whatever.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t account for the control unit, the thing that
decides when and how to reconfigure the network and whatnot.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
