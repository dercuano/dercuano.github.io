(15 minutes)</div><p>Neighbor predictors are a family of predictors in machine learning;
they work by predicting, from a probe point, some kind of average of
the points nearest to it.  K-nearest-neighbors, or K-nn, with a
constant number of nearest points, uniform weights, and the mode as
the kind of average, is the most common, but there are also
R-neighborhood algorithms which use all the points within some radius
R.</p>
<p>When the variable being predicted is continuous, it’s called
<em>regression</em>, and it’s common to use a weighting function or kernel so
that points very near the probe point weigh more heavily in the
average.</p>
<p>Commonly neighbor regression has discontinuities in their predictions
as the probe point moves around, and this represents suboptimal
performance, and makes them unusable for some purposes.  For example,
in <a href="../notes/multitouch-puppeteering.html">Multitouch and accelerometer puppeteering</a> and <a href="../notes/%25241-recognizer-diagrams.html">$1 recognizer diagrams</a> I
was looking for a way to morph smoothly between “keyframes” placed at
arbitrary points in a two-dimensional state space.  So I was looking
for a way to fix discontinuity in neighbor regression, and one
occurred to me.  Maybe it’s known.</p>
<h2>Continuous neighbor regression</h2>
<p>So, consider specifically the case where we’re using a weighted mean:
∑<sub><em>i</em></sub> <em>w</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>x</em>(<em>i</em>)) <em>y</em>(<em>i</em>), where
<em>x</em>(<em>i</em>) is the position of previously observed point <em>i</em>, <em>x</em>
is the position of the newly observed point we’re trying to predict,
<em>w</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is a weighting function which tells you how
relevant a point at <em>b</em> is for predicting a point at <em>a</em> with a
neighborhood of radius <em>r</em>, and <em>y</em>(<em>i</em>) are the observations
at the points <em>x</em>(<em>i</em>) of the variable to be predicted.
Commonly we normalize by dividing by ∑<sub><em>i</em></sub> <em>w</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>x</em>,
<em>x</em>(<em>i</em>)), particularly when the number of points in the
neighborhood may vary, and usually the weighting function is a
shift-invariant kernel of the form <em>w</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = <em>v</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>b</em> -
<em>a</em>).</p>
<p>Now, in this formulation, you could get discontinuities in three ways.
First, the radius <em>r</em> could change discontinuously as you move
continuously around the space.  Second, the function <em>v</em> might have
discontinuities, so that either a continuous change in <em>b</em> - <em>a</em> or a
continuous change in <em>r</em> might give rise to a discontinuity in <em>v</em>.
Third, if a point has nonzero weight when it enters or exits the
neighborhood, that will also give rise to a discontinuity, unless
another point simultaneously exits or enters in a way that compensates
for the discontinuity.</p>
<p>So the simplest way to get neighbor regression to be continuous is to
use a constant <em>r</em> and the kernel function</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>v</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>c</em>) = 1 - |<em>c</em>|/<em>r</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>so that when points enter or exit the neighborhood window, they do so
with zero weight, thus producing no discontinuity.</p>
<p>You can use a more elaborate kernel function; the only thing that’s
important is that it be continuous and reach 0 when <em>r</em> = |<em>c</em>|.
Usually you want it to be nonnegative, too, and rapid to compute.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can use a varying radius, as long as it varies
continuously.  The appeal of K-nearest-neighbors (as opposed to
R-neighbors) is that it becomes more detailed without becoming less
efficient in areas where you have more data; in Knn, the radius <em>also</em>
varies continuously, as there is never a discontinuity in the distance
to the Kth-nearest point.</p>
<h2>Differentiable neighbor regression</h2>
<p>The above cone kernel gives a continuous regression function, but its
derivative has discontinuities when points enter and exit the kernel
and when they cross its center.</p>
<p>If, additionally, the radius changes <em>differentiably</em> with your
position in the space, the kernel function <em>v</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>c</em>) is
differentiable as <em>r</em> and <em>c</em> change differentiably; points enter and
leave the window with not only zero weight but also zero weight
<em>derivative</em> (with respect to differentiable movement of the probe
point), then the resulting predictor is also differentiable.</p>
<p>If <em>v</em> is purely a function of |<em>c</em>|, making it rotationally
symmetric, it needs to have zero gradient when |<em>c</em>| = 0; otherwise it
will fail to be differentiable at that point.</p>
<p>The simplest way to satisfy this is to use a fixed <em>r</em> and a function
such as the “zero-phase Hanning window”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>v</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>c</em>) = 0.5(1 + cos (π<em>r</em>/|<em>c</em>|))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is differentiable and nonnegative, and has zero derivative at
|<em>c</em>| = 0 and |<em>c</em>| = <em>r</em>, value 1 at <em>c</em> = 0, and value 0 at |<em>c</em>| =
<em>r</em>.</p>
<p>However, the Hanning window is a bit heavyweight, requiring as it does
a transcendental function.  A low-degree polynomial function would be
more desirable; for example</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>v</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>c</em>) = 1 - 3<em>d</em><sup>2</sup> + 2<em>d</em><sup>3</sup> (where <em>d</em> = |<em>c</em>|/<em>r</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be computed as (2<em>d</em> - 3)<em>d</em><sup>2</sup> + 1, requiring a
doubling, a subtraction, a squaring, a multiplication, and an
increment.  Like the Hanning window, it is differentiable and
nonnegative, and has zero derivative at |<em>c</em>| = 0 and |<em>c</em>| = <em>r</em>,
value 1 at |<em>c</em>| = 0, and value 0 at |<em>c</em>| = <em>r</em>.  Visually it is
almost impossible to tell the two windows apart; they differ by about
0.01 at maximum.  (This function is in fact the unique degree-3
Hermite interpolation of the “Hanning window” at those two endpoints.)</p>
<p>This computational cost estimate is leaving something out, though: the
cost of computing |<em>c</em>|, which requires a square root!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>|<em>c</em>| = [∑<sub><em>i</em></sub> (<em>x<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>j</em>)) -
  <em>x<sub>i</sub></em>)<sup>2</sup>]<sup>0.5</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let’s consider instead the following much cheaper kernel function,
which has the same desirable properties but without requiring any
irrational functions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>v</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>c</em>) = 1 - 2<em>R</em> + <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> (where <em>R</em> = |<em>c</em>|<sup>2</sup>/<em>r</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This function, too, looks visually close to the Hanning window (though
it differs from it by up to about 0.065), is differentiable and
nonnegative, and has zero derivative at |<em>c</em>| = 0 and |<em>c</em>| = <em>r</em>,
value 1 at <em>c</em> = 0, and value 0 at <em>c</em> = <em>r</em>.  But it can be evaluated
by just a doubling, a squaring, a subtraction, and an increment, once
you have |<em>c</em>|<sup>2</sup> = ∑<sub><em>i</em></sub> (<em>x<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>j</em>)) -
<em>x<sub>i</sub></em>)<sup>2</sup>.  Not only does it avoid the square root,
it doesn’t even require a multiplier!  (Except for the pesky <em>r</em> scale
factor, that is.)</p>
<p>An alternative way to avoid square roots is to use a different
Minkowski <em>p</em>-norm of <em>c</em> rather than the Euclidean L<sub>2</sub> norm
used above, sacrificing pure rotational symmetry but avoiding the
squaring operations necessary to calculate |<em>c</em>| or even
|<em>c</em>|<sup>2</sup>.  The L<sub>1</sub> norm and the L<sub>∞</sub> norm
are both easier to compute, and in 1-D and 2-D they are equally good
approximations; in higher dimensionalities the L<sub>∞</sub>-norm ball
touches the L<sub>2</sub>-norm ball in more places than the
L<sub>1</sub>-norm ball does, which perhaps makes it a better
approximation.</p>
<p>You can get a reasonably good approximation of the L<sub>2</sub> norm
in a variety of cheaper ways.  Taking the maximum of the L<sub>∞</sub>
norm multiplied by √<em>d</em> (where <em>d</em> is the number of dimensions) and
the L<sub>1</sub> norm gives you a somewhat better approximation, as
does the sum of the L<sub>∞</sub> and L<sub>1</sub> norms, scaled
appropriately.  At least in two dimensions, the sum of these two
approximations, again scaled appropriately, is a better approximation
still.  (All of these approximations are also norms, as is easily
verified.)</p>
<p>The level set of the L<sub>∞</sub> norm is a hypercube, while the
level set of the L<sub>1</sub> norm is its dual, a “cross-polytope” or
“orthoplex” such as an octahedron or 16-cell.  The level sets of the
other combinations described above are progressively rounder polytopes
with their vertices all equidistant from the origin.</p>
<p>Most of the above discussion of efficiency concerns minimizing the bit
operations necessary, as if you were designing circuitry.  If you’re
using a modern CPU or GPU, the computation needed to dispatch an
instruction absolutely dwarfs the computation needed to multiply two
numbers or take a square root, so you should just use whatever takes
the fewest instructions.</p>
<h2>Differentiably variable neighborhood radii</h2>
<p>The above is perfectly fine for a fixed radius, but at times a
variable radius might be better, both to avoid deserts with no samples
to work from (or one sample, resulting in a flat plateau) and to avoid
well-covered regions where the kernel function blurs out almost all of
the local detail and additionally demands a lot of work.  But if we
just use a radius for K nearest neighbors, we inevitably run into
points where differentiability fails, as our expanding moving circle
bumps into a new Kth point and starts to contract, leaving an old
point behind.</p>
<p>So we need some way to compute a differentiably-changing radius that
still includes about the same number of points.</p>
<p>One way to handle this is to use a fixed-radius kernel to find nearby
points and see how many there are, or more precisely, what their
<em>w</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) adds up to.  This is a differentiable quantity, and
except at zero, so are its reciprocal and the reciprocal of its square
root.  If it covers a region where the points are distributed more or
less evenly, we can use that reciprocal square root as a kernel
radius, and it will tend to cover a more or less consistent number of
points.</p>
<p>It might be worthwhile to iterate this some fixed number of times,
such as two: use the sample of points captured by kernel <em>i</em> to
calculate a smaller radius at which to run kernel <em>i</em>+1, to calculate
a smaller radius at which to run kernel <em>i</em>+2.</p>
<p>Division by 0 is a constant risk here.  Perhaps for a given set of
points you could calculate a minimum radius needed to always avoid it.</p>
<p>This approach is commonly called a “balloon estimator”.</p>
<h2>Interpolation versus regression</h2>
<p>In machine learning it is typically assumed that the observed values
are subject to some noise, so predicting them all precisely is
symptomatic of overfitting and will lead to poor future results.  But
for some of the applications I have in mind, like animation keyframes
in an abstract character state space, we really would like to exactly
hit the given data point — we want to precisely interpolate a spline
(in the sense of Levien, not de Boor) rather than fitting a curve to
noisy data.</p>
<p>All the variants of neighbor regression described above, on a fixed
set of probe locations and data points, is a sparse linear
transformation of the data points it’s regressing to — the weight
values don’t depend on the <em>y</em>(<em>i</em>), just the <em>x</em>(<em>i</em>).  Moreover, I
think it tends to be a reasonably-well-conditioned one, at least if
your neighborhood widths are reasonable.  So determining the set of
ersatz observations <em>y</em>(<em>i</em>) we would need for it to precisely predict
the <em>actual</em> given observations <em>b</em>(<em>i</em>) is simply a matter of solving
the sparse linear system <strong>A</strong><em>y</em> = <em>b</em>, where the rows of the square
matrix <strong>A</strong> are computed with <em>w</em> on the observation points <em>x</em>(<em>i</em>).
Interpolating between <em>y</em> and <em>b</em> allows you to choose the degree to
which the surface has a little bit of freedom to suppress noisy
points.</p>
<p>This turns neighbor-regression algorithms into N-dimensional
surface-fitting algorithms, and they can be used thus as an
alternative to NURBS.</p>
<p>It lacks some desirable properties for such surface-fitting
algorithms; in particular, it lacks locality, in that a change to any
input point will in general result in changes everywhere on the
surface, not just near that point.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that there’s an existing standard way of doing
this, used for example in the sklearn documentation, but it sucks.  It
is to use <em>r</em>/|<em>c</em>| as the weight function, which diverges when |<em>c</em>|
= 0, but in that case you’re at a sample point and you can just use
the value of that sample point.  It’s continuous close to the sample
point, but it can have discontinuities when faraway points slip in and
out of the window; also, it’s far from differentiable, with sharp
spikes at all the sample points.</p>
<h2>Vector regression or interpolation</h2>
<p>Above I’ve been speaking in terms of observations <em>y</em>(<em>i</em>) and
predicted values.  It bears mentioning explicitly that these
observations are not necessarily scalars such as the height of a
surface; they might be, for example, vectors of 256 (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) pairs
describing the path of a pen stroke, as in the application to
<a href="../notes/%25241-recognizer-diagrams.html">$1 recognizer diagrams</a>.  All the math above works in the same way,
since the only thing we’re ever doing with the <em>y</em>(<em>i</em>) is forming
linear combinations of some of them weighted by the normalized weights
from <em>w</em> — except for the linear-interpolation linear system to be
solved in the interpolation-versus-regression section above, which
should be solved separately for each component of the observation
vector.  For example, solve one <strong>A</strong><em>y</em> = <em>b</em> problem for the <em>x</em>
coordinate of the first point in each pen stroke, then a second
<strong>A</strong><em>y</em> = <em>b</em> for the <em>y</em> coordinate of the first point, then a third
<strong>A</strong><em>y</em> = <em>b</em> for the <em>x</em> coordinate of the second point, and so on.</p>
<h2>A note on terminology</h2>
<p>My terminology in the above has been fairly inconsistent, both with
itself and with established terminology.  Knn is normally called
<em>k</em>-NN; the sample points are often called “training examples” rather
than “samples” and the space they are located in (the independent
variables) is called the “feature space” and sometimes the “search
space” with its dimensions being “features”; the regression result is
a “prediction” of a “property value” for the “object” or “query” or
“query example” or “test point” (what I sometimes called the probe
point above).  I should probably go back and fix it.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
