(5 minutes)</div><p>Many programmers who haven't delved deeply into functional programming
are puzzled about what closures are and why they would care.  And this
confusion sometimes gets worse when they find explanations that
explain how closures are implemented, namely by storing some extra
values along with a pointer to some function code and supplying those
values to the function when it is invoked.  But that doesn't get to
the heart of the matter, which is:</p>
<h2>Closures are the language feature that allow you to create new functions at runtime.</h2>
<p>Here's an example.  You can express the function (+) that adds two
numbers in just about any programming language. In old-style JS you
would write <code>function foo(a, b) { return a + b; }</code>, for example. And
similarly you can express the function (3+) that adds three to things:
<code>function foo(b) { return 3 + b; }</code>. But (3+) is obviously just one
example of a large class of functions like (4+), (5+), (-3 +), and so
on; it would clearly be nice to be able to generate instances of this
class of functions automatically instead of copying and pasting code
and editing the constant in it.</p>
<p>Closures are the language feature that make this possible; in JS, for
example, you can write <code>function adder(a) { function foo(b) { return a
+ b; } return foo; }</code> and you have a function which, at runtime,
creates arbitrary new instances of this adder class. This clearly
requires the binding of <code>a</code> to, say, 3 or 4 or 5 or -3, to stick
around somewhere, rather than being discarded when <code>adder</code> exits,
which you will note is not at all explicit in the original code.
Forth doesn't have closures but gets a similar ability in a different,
more explicit way, "at compile-time", that is, when you're building
the dictionary; you say <code>: adder create , does&gt; @ + ;</code> which allows
you to say things like <code>3 adder 3+</code>.</p>
<p>You might think that closures only allow the creation of a limited
class of copy-and-paste functions at run-time, but in fact they allow
you to create <em>any computable function</em> at run-time. In fact, you only
need <em>one function that creates closures</em> to do this; Moses
Schönfinkel showed in the 1920s† that it was possible with two curried
functions, conventionally called S and K:</p>
<pre><code>function S(x) {
    function S2(y) {
        function S3(z) { return x(z)(y(z)); }
        return S3;
    }
    return S2;
}

function K(x) {
    function K2(y) { return x; }
    return K2;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or, in modern JS:</p>
<pre><code>const S = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x(z)(y(z)), K = x =&gt; y =&gt; x
</code></pre>
<p>And, in 2001, <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/barker/Iota/">Chris Barker demonstrated</a> that you can do it with
just one, which can be written as <code>function ι(f) { return f(S)(K);
}</code>. The reductions from things like ordinary arithmetic, to the
λ-calculus, to S and K, to Barker's ι combinator, are an interesting
kind of mind-bending, the kind that makes you wonder why it took you
so long to understand them once you finally do understand them.</p>
<p>Pascal supports closures in a limited form that keeps them from
surviving the function that instantiated them, while some other
programming languages like Smalltalk-80 and GCC C have that
restriction but don't enforce it, so your program will probably just
crash if you violate it. Modern Smalltalk has full-fledged
unlimited-extent garbage-collected closures like JS and Scheme, as do
most modern languages: modern C++, Perl since Perl 5, Ruby since
forever, Kotlin, Java since Java 8 (?), and so on. Smalltalk is
particularly interesting in this regard because it uses closures
instead of conditionals and loops, using an extremely lightweight
syntax and some cheats in the compiler to make this practical. Some
Scheme implementations actually use closures to implement not only
conditionals and loops but even local variable declarations and
statement sequencing; <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/papers/diss.pdf">Olin Shivers wrote a widely-cited
dissertation</a> on how to make <em>that</em> insanity practical after
struggling with the problem for years.</p>
<p>That might be more information about closures than you wanted, but
hopefully it's enough to orient you and let you figure out what you
want to know more about.</p>
<h2>Footnote</h2>
<p>† Actually, Schönfinkel invented the SKI-combinator system in the
1920s, but Curry's further work on it and Church's invention of the
λ-calculus had to wait for the 1930s, and it wasn't until the 1940s
that the concept of "computable functions" was really clear, thanks to
the work of Curry, Gödel, Church, and Turing in the 1930s; at which
point it became clear what Schönfinkel had really proved.  At least
that's my understanding of the history, but I've never read
Schönfinkel's paper.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
