(23 minutes)</div><p>Git provides a sort of immutable Merkle-graph filesystem which saves
all previous versions of all files; every version of every file
(“blob”) is identified with its SHA-1 hash.  It’s hierarchically
structured, with a similar property for subdirectories (“trees”): iff
two subdirectories, or two versions of the same subdirectory, are
recursively identical, their hashes will match.  This is true across
time and across hosts.</p>
<p>You could imagine a variety of functionality based on a filesystem
with such an interface.  Git provides some of it: for example, it
eagerly eliminates duplicate files, so that storing a hundred
identical versions of a subdirectory tree in Git costs no more than
storing a single one, and storing a hundred nearly-identical versions
costs only slightly more.  (Storing a hundred nearly-identical
versions of a file is optimized using a different, heuristic,
mechanism).  It provides rapid access to previous snapshots of the
filesystem (though, unfortunately, usually through a stateful
interface.)  It provides relatively efficient synchronization of Git
repositories over the network, using the hashes to identify which data
needs to be transferred, and what data the receiver already possesses
and can thus use to compress the data being sent.</p>
<h2>Possible uses</h2>
<p>But in addition to duplicate-elimination, historical snapshot access,
and efficient network synchronization, such an interface can be used
for a variety of other purposes, including consistent-snapshot backup,
software downgrade, lazy file reading, userland hashing, polling for
generalized change notification, build systems, and maybe even
transactional filesystem updates.</p>
<h3>Consistent-snapshot backup</h3>
<p>Consider backing up a database server, for example.  Database servers
are designed so that, if the power fails, after a reboot, they will
not have lost any data — under some reasonable assumptions about write
ordering which are sometimes violated by actual disks, resulting in
permanent data loss.  So you would think that backing up the files or
raw disk partitions they store their data in (sometimes called
“tablespaces”) would enable you to recover to the point in time when
the backup was taken.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, backups are not taken at a point in time; it takes a
certain amount of time for the backup process to read from one end of
the tablespace to the other, during which time the database server may
be writing data.  So the data at the end of the tablespace will be of
a more recent vintage than the data at the beginning, producing
inconsistencies.  This can result in useless backups, a fact
discovered by many novice database administrators, to their dismay,
only after a data-loss disaster.</p>
<p>(SQLite and Berkeley DB have instructions in their documentation
providing an order in which active database files can be backed up
safely, but for many databases no such order exists.)</p>
<p>One of NetApp’s selling points in 1996 — at the point that their
entire website still had a bright yellow background — was that you
could take backups of databases.  You put the tablespaces on one of
their fileservers (then marketed as “FAServers”, now “filers”) and,
instead of backing up the live database, you make the fileserver take
a snapshot and then do the backup from the snapshot, not from the
constantly-mutating firesystem.</p>
<p>Such a backup from a consistent snapshot would be a useful application
of any snapshot-capable filesystem.  If you can take the snapshot of
the underlying block device rather than the filesystem, for example
using AWS EBS’s snapshot tools, that may work as well, but it’s
vulnerable to a certain very common class of filesystem implementation
bugs — it’s similar to recovering the filesystem after a system crash,
and if the filesystem doesn’t actually provide the sequencing
guarantees it claims to provide, the tablespace could be inconsistent
anyway.  Also, successfully mounting the snapshot of the live filesystem
often  requires the ability to modify it to correct inconsistencies in the
filesystem itself (e.g., replaying filesystem journals) which requires
copy-on-write functionality if it is to both be fast and not violate
the integrity of the snapshot.</p>
<p>Git doesn’t provide this functionality because it doesn’t offer an API
that any database servers use to store their data.</p>
<h3>Software downgrade</h3>
<p>Upgrading software is a constant necessity, both due to the insane
epidemic of software security holes and to provide new functionality
users want.  But upgrading a system you depend on is always somewhat
risky: the upgrade may break it, in subtle or obvious ways.  Being
able to reset the whole filesystem to a previous snapshot can reduce
this risk greatly, as it does on AWS EBS, and I think this
functionality can be provided more cheaply at the filesystem level
than the block device level.</p>
<h3>Lazy file reading</h3>
<p>When I open a large file in Emacs, it copies the entire thing into
virtual memory — it doesn’t necessarily
have to fit into RAM, but at least into swap by
way of RAM.  This is necessary because, while I’m editing the file,
something else may be modifying the file while Emacs has it open, and
in such a case, Emacs wants to be able to detect the conflict and
offer options for resolving it.  If it only read the file into memory
lazily, as parts of it were requested, it could not do this.  Even if
I’m just scrolling through the file, you could imagine a modification
in the middle of the file that results in “torn reads” — where one
data block is from before the modification, while the following data
block is from after it, and their juxtaposition results in
inconsistent results.</p>
<p>It is for this same reason that incorrectly upgrading active shared
libraries — which are memory-mapped by ld.so — can result in core
dumps.</p>
<p>If Emacs could, instead, open a <em>current snapshot</em> of the file,
trusting the filesystem to not permit modification of any of the data
in the snapshot instead of eagerly making a copy of the whole thing,
it could open files of any size instantaneously.</p>
<p>As described in “Proposal for the Implementation by Xanadu Operating
Company of a Full-scale Semi-distributed Multi-user Hypertext System”,
1984-04-25:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Separate processes which request the retrieval of the same orgl at
the same time are each given different berts which reter to the
orgl.  Associated with each orgl is a count of the number of berts
which currently refer to it.  If one of these processes then makes
an edit change to the orgl, a new orgl will be created.  The
process’s bert will be made to refer to the new orgl and the old
orgl’s reference count will be decremented.  By this means, the
other processes will not “see” the change, and their berts will
still refer to the same V to I mapping as previously.  Any
information about the orgl’s state which the other processes might
have been keeping externally will not be invalidated by the one
process’s edit operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, Emacs depends on filesystem metadata modification to know if
modifications have happened since it read the file; this is not
entirely reliable, particularly on filesystems whose modification time
granularity is 1000 or 2000 milliseconds.  Checking a
filesystem-maintained hash of the file would be considerably
safer.</p>
<h3>Userland hashing</h3>
<p>If you want to know if any of the files installed by any of your
Debian packages have changed, you can run the <code>debsums</code> command to
compute secure hashes of them, comparing them against the hashes in
the original packages.  Unfortunately, this is slow, because it has to
read all the file data.  If the filesystem provided a trustworthy
hash — in 2019, maybe we’d choose SHA-256 rather than SHA-1, among
other things to preserve a 2¹²⁸ security factor even in a postquantum
future — this would be instantaneous, as long as the filesystem’s
hashes themselves were not out of date.</p>
<p>Additionally, though, if you wanted to maintain a list of the hashes
of some files using some other algorithm (for example, BLAKE2B), you
could associate them with the filesystem’s file hashes rather than
merely with filenames.  When a file's filesystem hash changed, you
would know that you needed to recompute its BLAKE2B hash.  This is in a
sense a special case of the “build systems” item below.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the filesystem itself could maintain potentially more
than one hash for each file.</p>
<h3>Polling for generalized change notification, like inotify</h3>
<p>The inotify API in Linux allows a running process to be woken up
asynchronously when a file is changed or when any file in a directory
is modified; for example, <code>tail -f</code> uses this to display new lines
appended to a logfile immediately, rather than polling once per
second, and GUI file managers use inotify to keep their windows
up-to-date with the filesystem — so that newly created files are
displayed, files whose contents have changed get updated, and deleted
files disappear.  The only way to do this with the standard Unix API
is to poll periodically, wasting energy in the case where nothing has
changed, and still delaying change propagation by up to the polling
period.</p>
<p>However, inotify is still somewhat limited.  It only applies at a
per-directory level, so starting to watch for changes throughout an
entire subtree of the filesystem requires a recursive traversal of the
subtree with a couple of system calls per directory.  And it has no
way to determine whether changes happened when the process wasn’t
running — the GUI file manager has no way to cache its display in case
it’s restarted without a directory having been changed, but must
laboriously re-examine the same data it examined on the previous
execution.</p>
<p>By contrast, if there were a hash for the directory subtree and for
each file within it, the file manager could validate its cached
display against these hashes when it’s restarted.  And a filesystem
watcher doesn’t need to recurse through the entire tree to set up
notifications — although it may need to recurse to track down the
source of a notification.</p>
<h3>Build systems</h3>
<p>The <code>make</code> system does several things, but one big one is caching of
previously-executed computations.  Supposing that your compiler is
deterministic (a difficult problem in modern systems, though one being
tackled by Debian’s Reproducible Builds project and by Nix and Guix),
it will always produce the same output files given the same input
files and options.  <code>make</code> relies on filesystem timestamps for this,
but a more reliable approach would use secure hashes of the file
inputs instead, or other handles to immutable versions of the files.
(And a filesystem that records the files accessed by a build step, by
interposing a check on open() and similar system calls, can provide a
more reliable dependency set, not depending on compilers and Makefile
authors to specify the dependency set.)</p>
<p>Compilation steps can also potentially depend on the contents of
directories, and this introduces a potential problem.  For example, I
just ran a compilation command with GCC which did, among other things,
the following sequence of system calls, with others interspersed:</p>
<pre><code>[pid 25870] open("../yeso/time.h", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid 25870] open("/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5/include/time.h", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid 25870] open("/usr/local/include/time.h", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid 25870] open("/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5/include-fixed/time.h", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid 25870] open("/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/time.h", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid 25870] open("/usr/include/time.h", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY) = 4
[pid 25870] fstat(4, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=13543, ...}) = 0
[pid 25870] read(4, "/* Copyright (C) 1991-2016 Free "..., 13543) = 13543
</code></pre>
<p>An interposition-based system that concluded that this compilation
step depended on the contents and filesystem metadata of
<code>/usr/include/time.h</code> would be correct, but it <em>also</em> depends on the
<em>nonexistence</em> of <code>/usr/local/include/time.h</code>, among other things.  If
GCC had found <code>/usr/local/include/time.h</code>, it wouldn’t have continued
on to read <code>/usr/include/time.h</code>.</p>
<p>But it would be very unfortunate for the build step to be re-executed
because the contents of <code>/usr/local/include</code> had changed, or worse,
because <code>/usr/local</code>, <code>/usr</code>, or <code>/</code> had a change somewhere beneath
them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, GCC didn’t call <code>getdents()</code> (at least in this case), so
we can automatically define the dependency more narrowly to <em>just</em> the
files it specifically probed for — the rest of the directory’s
contents were not relevant.</p>
<p>Other systems whose results we might want to cache, such as the
<code>updatedb</code> part of <code>locate</code>, might indeed walk an entire filesystem
tree using <code>getdents()</code>.  Such systems would need a bit more surgery
to make their results usefully cacheable — they would need to somehow
split it into separable transactions per subdirectory tree.</p>
<h3>Transactional filesystem updates</h3>
<p>ACID transactions are contagious; like other acids, they tend to
splash on unexpected things and produce unexpected results on them.
If your filesystem can provide ACID transaction updates, then you can
expand the scope of whatever transactions you’re doing in your program
to include the filesystem.  Some form of this is necessary if you want
your transactions to be actually durable, rather than just “ACI”,
longing after the D.  Providing processes in other transactions with a
view of all the files as they were before your transaction began to
modify them is very similar to simply providing them with snapshots
from before the transaction, but it requires at least some kind of
atomic validate-and-commit operation.  If you’re going to participate
in two-phase commit at that level, it further requires the ability to
lock the validation in place while you’re waiting for other
participants in the transaction, which means potentially denying other
writers to the filesystem.</p>
<p>Accessing the same mutable data within transactions and also outside
of transactions has some pitfalls!  Beware!</p>
<h2>Implementation issues</h2>
<p>Given the above list of benefits, what problems do we need to solve to
implement the system?  We need to decide on the granularity of
hashing, deal with the possibility of hash inconsistency, and figure
out what to do about hashes being broken, foreign filesystems, and
space exhaustion.</p>
<h3>Granularity and splitting</h3>
<p>As explained in more detail below, on Flash, unchanged data is necessarily copied
from one place to another periodically, offering the opportunity to
hash it, but maybe not an entire file at a time.  Also, processes like
database servers expect to be able to efficiently write individual
sectors, or at least tracks (≈100 KiB), of a potentially much larger
file; such an operation shouldn’t have to reread the entire file to
compute the new hash.  So probably you want to hash data in chunks
close to the size of a disk block, in the range of 512–262144 bytes,
and build some kind of Merkle tree from that for larger files.
BitTorrent does this, for example, hashing each “piece” of a torrent
separately; the <code>btih:</code> schema in Magnet links then uses the hash of
the torrent file as a whole.</p>
<p>For text files and other files in which blocks of data might move
around, it’s desirable to be able to draw the boundaries of the Merkle
tree nodes in a way that can recognize a mostly-unchanged file, even
if something has been inserted or deleted.  Silentbicycle’s “jumprope”
data structure used in his “Tangram” filesystem and the splitting
system used by Avery Pennarun’s “bupsplit” system are two variants on
this theme.</p>
<h3>How can the filesystem's internal hashes get out of date?</h3>
<p>The filesystem’s hashes can get out of date via bit-flip errors on the
disk, via modifications of the disk’s data that don’t go through the
filesystem (for example, if you edit the disk with a hex editor), or
via bugs in the filesystem, so they need to be checked, as <code>git fsck</code>
does.</p>
<p>If the filesystem is running on raw Flash that suffers from read
disturb, all data needs to be copied to new Flash blocks periodically;
this affords an opportunity to check its hashes in the process.  For
this to work, the data probably needs to be hashed at a finer
granularity than an arbitrarily-large file.  Similarly, on Flash, live
blocks periodically need to be copied from mostly-empty pages into new
pages so that the old pages can be erased, affording a similar
opportunity.</p>
<h3>Cryptographic agility</h3>
<p>In retrospect, it looks like baking SHA-1 into every persistent
structure in the Git universe may have been a bad idea — SHA-1 is too
short to resist well-resourced attacks with Grover’s algorithm, if
that becomes feasible, and it has shown some worrisome signs of
weakness in the last couple of decades, with some theoretical
collision attacks published.</p>
<p>For most of the applications cited above, user processes don’t need to
access the actual hash values used to index the on-disk data; they can
manipulate them through opaque handles like file descriptors,
referring either to specific versions of files or to the
time-dependent value of “the current state of such-and-such a
filesystem entity” (from which the current version can be
obtained) — although equality comparison must also be provided.
Duplicate-data elimination, previous-snapshot access,
consistent-snapshot backup, lazy file reading, and run-time polling
for change notification could work with such opaque identifiers.
However, you need some kind of stable serialization of these snapshot
identifiers for software downgrade, change notification across process
restarts, and build systems (across process restarts); for efficient
network synchronization and userland hash verification, you
additionally need to be able to get the results of a <em>specific</em> hash
algorithm, because if your filesystem is giving you SHA-1 hashes and
the server has upgraded to BLAKE2B, or your filesystem has upgraded to
SHA-256 hashes but your package manager only uses SHA-1, you’re in
trouble.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to handle this.  You could have the
filesystem internally compute a non-constant set of hashes — perhaps
the old version of a file has a SHA-1 Merkle tree hash with a
blocksize of 8192, while the new version uses a blocksize of 131072,
so that if you want to compare them you need to ask the filesystem to
compute the other hash for one of the two, which it will store
thereafter.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could fix the algorithm for a given filesystem, and
allow userland processes to use the usual caching approaches to
compute hashes using their favored algorithms when they need them,
indexing them to individual snapshots if desired.</p>
<h3>Compatibility with foreign on-disk filesystems</h3>
<p>Suppose your operating system provides such an interface as its native
filesystem interface.  What happens when you plug in your USB pendrive
with a VFAT firesystem on it?  VFAT doesn’t give you an efficient way
to get the hash of a single file, much less an entire subdirectory
tree.</p>
<p>I think the key is to use the previously described
opaque-version-identifier interface as long as possible; as long as no
userland process requests a serialized hash for a filesystem node, you
can postpone hashing the file.  You can still provide access to
snapshots of old versions of the filesystem by buffering the old
versions of modified filesystem pages in RAM, as long as some snapshot
refers to them.  And, once a hash is requested, the OS can retain the
hash in RAM as long as the firesystem is mounted.</p>
<p>There may be some filesystems — btrfs, perhaps, or ZFS — which provide
a reliable way to determine whether a file has been modified since the
last time the filesystem was mounted.  They might have some kind of
generation count or journal timestamp when the file was last modified.
On such foreign systems, you could either use journal-timestamp/inode
pairs (or whatever version identifier you end up using) in place of
hashes, or you could store a lazily-populated mapping from foreign
version identifiers to secure hashes.</p>
<h3>Space exhaustion</h3>
<p>A serious problem with any kind of lazy copy-on-write system — whether
Linux’s memory-page allocation, NetApp’s WAFL block allocation, Flash
FTLs, or a log-structured filesystem — is that space usage is somewhat
unpredictable and difficult to attribute to a single cause.
Consequently, it becomes exhausted unpredictably, and then it isn’t
entirely clear how to respond.  With the foreign-filesystem interface
described in the previous section, the problem is potentially
exacerbated by having to buffer old versions of filesystem data in
RAM, and RAM may be much smaller than the filesystem.</p>
<p>This is particularly a problem when it comes to database transaction
durability.  A database executing a two-phase commit must check for
all possible errors, especially including errors of disk-space
exhaustion, during the PREPARE phase; once the transaction enters the
COMMIT phase, it is too late to rollback the transaction because of
being out of space.  For this particular case, we can use a call to
preallocate some space that we may want to write to later on,
producing a conservative (pessimistic) failure indication if there may
not be space available.  If the filesystem can then optimize the
actual data by, for example, noting that the disk block written is the
same as some other disk block, so much the better — such a situation
could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, but never defeat from
the jaws of victory.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
