<p>We should be able to get astoundingly precise positional and force
measurements using the principles by which musical instruments are
tuned, especially string instruments.</p>
<h2>Genesis</h2>
<p>A friend invited me to a work of musical theater tonight; despite the
astoundingly adept dances, I was captivated by the designs of the
improvised musical instruments — one being a Blue-Man-Group style PVC
flapped pipe organ, where the players activate particular pipes by
whacking their upper ends with heavy rubber flaps, and others being a
sort of dulcimer or harp with six to ten strings each, in which one
end of the string was anchored to the center of the bottom of a
topless tin can, which can was screwed down to a wooden table, and the
other end of the string was anchored to a hard object fastened to the
table some distance away (I’d call it a “barrel”, but in this context
that word might be taken literally).</p>
<p>The thing that most captivated me was the extreme pitch bend the
player would sometimes extract from the string by squeezing the can a
little bit.  Perhaps the rim of the can would lift by ten millimeters
under this treatment, so the bottom where the string was anchored
might be changing its natural position by two millimeters or so, but
in all likelihood the can top was substantially more compliant than
the string, so perhaps the string end was being displaced by half a
millimeter or less out of the 500 millimeters or so of the string’s
length: a variation in length on the order of one part in a thousand.
Nevertheless, the pitch bend was quite audible and even extreme, maybe
more than a semitone.</p>
<h2>Position sensing mechanisms</h2>
<p>It occurred to me that this pitch-bending could be the foundation of
very precise measurement techniques for measuring distance and thus
size.</p>
<h3>Audible pitch bending from string tension change</h3>
<p>Electric guitar players commonly do pitch bends by shoving their
guitar strings a centimeter or so to the side along the fret, thus
lengthening the string.  (Or they use the whammy bar, if they have
one.)  If the string is one meter in length, this would lengthen it to
√(1 m² + 1 cm²) = 1.00005 m, about 0.05 millimeters over a meter.
Clearly the pitch bend is giving us a measurement of the string length
that is sensitive to variations of some 50 parts per million, even
better than I estimated in the paragraph above.  (But maybe the
strings connected to the cans weren’t steel.)</p>
<p>How sensitive should we expect pitch bending to be to the position on
the end of the string?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music)#Human_perception">The Wikipedia article on the musical cent
says</a>
that humans can directly hear pitch differences once they’re larger
than 5–25 cents, depending on musical training, on how high the pitch
is, and on the harmonic content of the sound.  A cent is a variation
in frequency of about 578 parts per million, so the just-noticeable
difference is on the order of 5000 to 20000 parts per million.  The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics">psychoacoustics article
claims</a> human frequency
resolution is about 3.6 Hz in the 1–2 kHz octave, which is 1800 to
3600 ppm.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_guitar_strings">The Wikipedia article on classical guitar strings
says</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrating_string">the
Wikipedia vibrating-string article confirms and explains in more
detail</a> that the
velocity of waves in strings is √(T/μ), where μ is the linear mass
density and T is the tension.  We can extrapolate that when the
strings approach zero tension, the wave velocity (and thus the
frequency) approaches zero, and when the tension varies by 1000 parts
per million, the wave velocity varies by 500 parts per million.  The
frequency should vary by less than 0.5%, since the length of the
string and its mass density are also changing, but the difference in
those is much smaller, because the tension varies proportional to the
difference from the string’s natural length, while the length and mass
density vary proportional to its difference from zero length, which is
orders of magnitude larger.</p>
<p>So we should expect an audible pitch bend when the string <em>tension</em>
changes by something like 5000 to 10000 parts per million, 0.5% to 1%.
At most, for a steel string, the tension elongates the string by about
1% — after that, I think music wire will break, though most steels
would deform plastically first — so you should always be able to hear
an elongation of 2% of that, 0.02% of the total length, 200 parts per
million.  This is pretty close to the electric guitar number above.</p>
<p>But that’s the <em>worst</em> case!  We can do much better by putting the
string under less tension.  In theory, this should give us arbitrarily
precise measurement of the string length, though only over
correspondingly arbitrarily short distances.  Indeed, I think this is
one reason musical instruments are strung tightly, so that they won’t
go out of tune easily, and so that the string frequency doesn’t rise
for louder notes.  In practice, I’m confident you can get one order of
magnitude improvement: a length resolution of 20 parts per million.</p>
<h3>Inaudible pitch bending and frequency counters</h3>
<p>That, though, is assuming we’re trying to detect the length by ear
alone.  Even a purely acoustic apparatus could improve on that: use
two strings — a reference string of fixed length tuned to, say,
3000 Hz, while the measurement string is tuned to 3010 Hz at its
default position.  These will audibly beat at 10 Hz, more so if the
second harmonic is attenuated (for example, by plucking or striking
them in the center).  It should be easy to hear differences in the
beat frequency of 2 Hz or less, allowing an experimenter to hear
variations in pitch of some 700 ppm, and thus variations in tension of
1400 ppm and in length of about 1.4 ppm.</p>
<p>But if we’re thinking of an electronic measuring apparatus, rather
than a purely acoustic one, we could straightforwardly just use a
frequency counter to measure the frequency; these routinely have
absolute accuracy of better than 1 ppm, and short-term precision even
better than that.  I think that would allow you to measure variations
in length of about 0.001 ppm, 1 ppb.</p>
<p>At audio frequencies with guitar-sized 1-meter-long strings, 1 ppb is
1 nm, about 10 carbon atoms.  If you use the same string under the
same tension but only 100 mm of length, you get three octaves higher
pitch (on the order of 10 kHz instead of 1 kHz) and resolution of
0.1 nm, about one carbon atom.</p>
<h3>Electric guitar pickups</h3>
<p>You can use an electric guitar pickup to detect very small movements
of the string.  Linearity isn’t important, since the frequency is what
we’re interested in.</p>
<h3>The slide guitar mechanism</h3>
<p>The string-stretching mechanism described so far (call it the “whammy
bar mechanism”) has one big drawback: the apparatus is very large
compared to the displacements being measured.  So our hypothetical
100-mm-long, 0.1-nm-resolution sensor described above is only capable
of making any measurement at all over the range of about a millimeter
before breaking the string, and only about 300 μm with precision in
the 0.1-nm range.</p>
<p>As an alternative, instead of altering the pitch of the string by
stretching it, we could alter its pitch by sliding a “bottleneck”
along it, as in slide-guitar playing.  Only the length of the string
up to the bottleneck vibrates, so its frequency gives us a
proportional measurement of the bottleneck’s position.  This way, a
meter-long sensor, for example, could read out a location anywhere
within a 500-mm length while staying within a single octave.</p>
<p>The precision is correspondingly lower, but if you’re using a
1-ppm-error frequency counter, you still get 1-micron resolution over
a meter.</p>
<h3>Trombone pipes</h3>
<p>As an alternative to strings, you could use a column of air as your
resonant medium, sliding one pipe inside another to continuously vary
its length.  The only advantage of this that occurs to me is that you
can use any material at all.  The precision and range should be
comparable to the slide-guitar mechanism.</p>
<h3>Delay line noise correlation and matched impedances</h3>
<p>The above resonant mechanisms have certain problems with noise
susceptibility and ringdown: it’s quite reasonable to imagine that
there might be vibrations in the environment within the range used by
the instrument, and it would pick them up and could give erroneous
readings as a result.  Moreover, once they are resonating at some
frequency, that vibration itself could bounce around inside solid
bodies and be picked up even after the distance has changed — in
effect, the instrument in the past produces its own interference in
the future.</p>
<p>Instead of measuring a resonant frequency, though, you could generate
random noise, or better still LFSR noise, and feed it into the
measurement medium at one point and then read it back out — either at
the same point after it’s rebounded from the far end, or
electronically at some other point, and measure the time lag with
maximum correlation instead of a resonant frequency.  In this case,
the resonance of the medium is actually undesirable, and you can use
the same matched-impedance technique used in electronic signal
transmission lines to prevent repeated reflection back and forth and
the resulting resonance.  That way, the signal you detect is a clean
copy of a single lagged version of your input signal, not a sum of
many past segments of the signal at different lags, progressively more
attenuated.</p>
<p>A particularly interesting approach here is the slide-guitar approach,
using non-contact sensing of vibrations in a wire as they travel past,
for example using magnetic pickups, so that several sensors can share
a single wire, which can end damped by a felt pad or something like
that, beyond the sensors; or the trombone approach.</p>
<h3>Free-air measurements</h3>
<p>Once resonance is no longer needed, you might be able to dispense with
the string or pipe and just transmit the ultrasonic noise signal
through free air, permitting distance measurements at many points in
space and thus triangulation.  Stray reflections may give rise to
multipath ghosting, but hopefully they can be kept manageable.</p>
<h2>Sources of error</h2>
<p>There are a variety of reasons that the temporal measurement from any
of the three mechanisms discussed above might vary for reasons other
than the displacements that we want to measure.  We can try to
eliminate these, or we can try to measure them and correct for them.
For example, a free-air system should have at least one microphone a
known, fixed distance away from the sound source, in order to correct
for variations in the speed of sound in air.</p>
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p>The natural length of the string will vary as it expands and contracts
under the influence of temperature, potentially altering its tension,
but in itself this need not introduce a large error — if the frame
it’s stretched on expands and contracts by the same proportion, its
tension should remain constant.  This may be difficult, since making
the frame from music wire is probably not practical, and even if it
is, the properties of music wire should vary by diameter.</p>
<p>The slide-guitar mechanism will, however, have a
temperature-proportional error in position: if a movement causes the
frequency to change by 0.1%, that represents a movement of 0.1% of its
total length.  But if it has expanded from 1000 mm to 1000.5 mm due to
temperature, that 0.1% is now 0.10005% of its original length.</p>
<p>I think the whammy-bar mechanism will also have an analogous error:
the Young’s modulus of the string material will not remain constant
with temperature, and indeed I think should have roughly the same
thermal coefficient as the material’s natural length.</p>
<p>Steel’s coefficient of thermal expansion is about 10.8 ppm/° around
room temperature, so we’re easily looking at a 100 ppm error here if
temperature is not controlled.</p>
<p>The trombone mechanism, however, suffers greatly from temperature
drift, since the speed of sound in gases varies as the square root of
the temperature.  A variation of 2% in the temperature (5.5°) thus
changes the tuning or time lag of the tube by 1%.</p>
<p>A potentially much bigger problem for the whammy-bar mechanism is
that, when the surrounding temperature changes, the string will reach
the new temperature much sooner than the frame will; and if a human
handles the device, they will warm it up where they touch it.  If the
string is steel 10° warmer than the steel frame, it will be ≈108 ppm
longer, but if its strain was only 1000 ppm, that’s an error of 11%,
110’000 ppm, in the strain.</p>
<p>The use of Invar or some similar material might be worthwhile if the
apparatus cannot be protected from such variations in temperature.</p>
<h3>Humidity and pressure</h3>
<p>Solid materials should be pretty immune to pressure (at least until
the mass of the air around the string becomes significant compared to
that of the string — steel weighs about 8000 times as much as the same
volume of air, and air’s density varies only proportional to pressure,
so this should be a source of uncontrolled variation of frequency in
the 1 ppm range).  Steel is pretty immune to humidity, too, but other
possible string materials might be hygroscopic.</p>
<p>The trombone mechanism, including the free-air version, suffers the
most here: although to first order the speed of sound in air doesn’t
vary with pressure, it does vary with humidity; since water replaces
some air molecule with water molecules of roughly half the weight, it
speeds up sound transmission by up to about half a percent,
introducing a half-percent error (5000 ppm) in the distance
measurement.</p>
<h3>Creep</h3>
<p>Creep can reduce tension over time if a string is under constant
tension.  Steel doesn’t creep much at room temperature, which is how
pianos can stay in tune for months or years at a time, but other
possible string materials (and, even more so, frame materials) might
creep rather badly.  And it might be that these mechanisms are
sensitive enough to detect creep phenomena in steel that usually go
undetected.</p>
<h3>Latency</h3>
<p>It’s desirable for position transducers to respond as rapidly as
possible to help keep control loops stable.</p>
<p>The resonant approaches suffer from the need for vibrations to build
up over potentially several round trips; the noise-correlation
approach avoids this, but still requires at least one round trip if
the microphone is colocated with the speaker.  Sound in air travels at
only 343 m/s, so measuring a distance of a meter is going to take
about 3 ms.  Music wire can transmit vibrations faster but you’re
still potentially looking at milliseconds of latency if you wait for
the reflection.</p>
<p>However, with the noise-correlation approach, if you locate the sensor
at the place whose position you’re measuring, you don’t suffer this
latency (except in the whammy-bar mechanism, which inherently averages
the propagation time over the time the signal is traveling through the
string).  You just need enough signal to correlate so that you don't
get misled by noise.  So you could have a feedback latency measured in
microseconds (assuming the vibration frequencies are sub-MHz) instead
of milliseconds.</p>
<h2>Measuring force instead of displacement</h2>
<p>The wire we’re talking about here is elastic, which is how sound waves
can travel over it in the first place.  Up to now, the force needed to
stretch it has been nothing more than a nuisance — hopefully we can
use a thin enough wire that it doesn’t exert too much force and
disturb the thing we’re trying to measure.  But what if we use that
very elasticity?  Instead of stretching the string on a frame, hang an
unknown mass from it and weigh it by way of measuring the sound
propagation speed on the string.  It’s like the whammy-bar mechanism,
but now our guitar has no neck.</p>
<p>Again, we should expect to be able to measure the lag with an error of
about 1 ppm, translating to 2 ppm error in the tension, with (I'm
guessing) 11 ppm/° of thermal error.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
