(22 minutes)</div><p>Summary: 20q.net seems to do badly at choosing questions.  It was able
to guess the axolotl and the domestic cat; but it missed the sailboat,
a gallon bottle of milk, one million, basil, a knife-sharpening stone,
methyl ethyl ketone, Che Guevara's corpse, Mare Imbrium, and a leather
high-heeled tango shoe.</p>

<p>The opinions of the 20Q A.I. are its own, and are based on the input

20Q is in error, the only way to correct it is to play again!</p>
<p>Similar Objects</p>
<p>a tadpole, a cichlid (tropical freshwater fish), a largemouth bass, a
newt, a salamander, a paramecium (protozoa), a guppy (fish), a
bullfrog, a trout (fish), a koi (fish), a leech, a Siamese fighting
fish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it's hardly surprising that it had so much trouble guessing in
that case.  I had two "wrong" answers.</p>
<p>Still, it doesn't seem like 20Q is doing the best possible job of
choosing questions.  How often is an animal an appliance, and how
often does an animal that doesn't live in salt-water live in the
ocean?</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that it can only live out of water if given an iodine
injection to induce metamorphosis.</p>
