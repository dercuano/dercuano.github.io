(1 minute)</div><p>If you have two Pythagorean triples a²+b²=x² and c²+d²=y² you could be
said to implicitly be talking about two triangles (a,b,x) and (c,d,y).
One of the angles in these two triangles is tan⁻¹(b/a) and in the
other is tan⁻¹(d/c).  If you put these two angles adjacent to each
other and scale the (c,d,y) triangle up to use the (a,b) vector as the
basis for its x-axis and a (-b, a) vector as the basis for its y-axis,
then its (c, 0) side has become (ca, cb), and the side from (c, 0) to
(c, d) now has a displacement of (-bd, ad), so the new corner is at
(ca-bd, cb+ad), so the tangent of the angle sum is going to be
(cb+ad)/(ca-bd).</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/math.html">Math</a> (78 notes)
