(12 minutes)</div><p>My regular netbook isn't working because I left the charger at work.
I've managed to get this old Thinkpad to boot, though installing Ubuntu
seems to be not working (this ten-year-old CD-R is probably corrupt,
judging from the kernel log messages), and I can't remember the disk
encryption password I set on this machine probably nine years ago, which
leads me to think about how much hassle is involved in even the most
basic computing tasks.</p>
<p>If only I had an easily bootable operating system I could fire up from
this pendrive in a matter of seconds!  If only I could add notes to it
from anywhere anonymously, later accepting them!</p>
<p>I feel like my RPN calculator app may be a step in the right direction.
In it, keys 0-9 add to the number at the current position in the RPN
program (space works as a separator between adjacent numbers), and the
program is executed after each edit to build up a stack of expressions
that are then executed.  Operator keys are used to combine expressions
into larger expressions.  The operator "," concatenates numbers into a
vector, with the usual kind of APL broadcasting operations.  The "l" and
"e" operators are ln and exp, respectively, enabling relatively easy
powers and roots.  The "i" operator is the APL iota, but zero-based,
allowing the instant construction of sequences covering some range.</p>
<p>Vectors are automatically plotted, as well as being displayed
numerically.  A somewhat generous estimated calculated precision is
maintained for each number, and its display is limited to that
precision, in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the display.</p>
<p>Alt-left and alt-right (or, for phones, $ and &amp;) perform structural
editing of the RPN program, moving an entire subexpression left or
right over other instructions.  Left and right (or the parentheses)
navigate the RPN program, showing you the intermediate value calculated
at each node.</p>
<p>At present it lacks even the minimal abstraction ability to use the same
value twice.  For example, to compute the first six triangular numbers,
you can use the sequence <code>6i6i1+*2/</code>, resulting in the expression <code>i 6 *
(i 6 + 1) / 2</code>.  But to change this to the first 10 numbers, for
example, you must go back and edit both of the sixes.</p>
<p>It also lacks any kind of aggregate calculation, even summing or array
indexing, any kind of mouse interaction, and decimal points.</p>
<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>I'm increasingly coming to the conclusion that stacks are good for
expression evaluation, but too confusing when you try to use them for
general-purpose data storage; the position of any given value relative
to the top of the stack is constantly changing.  So probably to reuse
values, it's better to use registers, i.e. variables, rather than
providing stack manipulation operators, at least in the context of
interactive calculations.</p>
<p>However, a set of interactions has occurred to me that seem like they
should make abstraction by refactoring quite simple:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#</code> to fetch a value recently computed, repeated to refer to less
  recent such values; in effect this is the "introduce local variable"
  refactoring, but with a user interface based on the Mill CPU's belt,
  and no need to specify ahead of time which values will be reused.
  However, once you are done wrapping a computation in a definition in
  this way, later # operations will skip over its internal structure.</li>
<li>: when within such a definition to turn the subexpression you're
  currently looking at into a parameter, pushing that subexpression out
  into every place where it's invoked, turning it into a function.  If
  you do this with the entire contents of the definition, you have
  reversed the refactoring, and the subexpression evaporates.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for example, in the case above about the triangular numbers, after
having typed "6i", you could type "#", which would put the "i 6" into a
subexpression, used twice.  Maybe this would be displayed like this:</p>
<pre><code>x = i 6 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
</code></pre>
<p>Then, on typing "1+*2/", you would see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>x = i 6 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
x * (x + 1) / 2 = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
</code></pre>
<p>If you move the pointer back to the 6 and type ":", you are pushing the
6 up to the level where x is invoked, making x a function; the result
would be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>x(y) = i y
x(6) * (x(6) + 1) / 2 = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, the two 6es have become independent (although that may
not have been the right default).  To make them dependent again, you can
put the cursor on the second one and type ## to fetch the first 6, then
move right and delete the second one.  The result would be something
like this:</p>
<pre><code>x(y) = i y
z = 6
x(z) * (x(z) + 1) / 2 = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
</code></pre>
<p>If you go to the end and "#" it to turn the triangular-numbers
calculation into a local subexpression, you get something like this:</p>
<pre><code>x(y) = i y
z = 6
a = x(z) * (x(z) + 1) / 2 = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
a = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
a = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
</code></pre>
<p>Now it may be desirable to make z a parameter of a.  If you put the
cursor on the first reference to z and use ":", you get this:</p>
<pre><code>x(y) = i y
z = 6
a(b) = x(b) * (x(z) + 1) / 2
a(z) = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
a(z) = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can move over to the second z and use "##" to turn it into
another reference to b, then delete the z:</p>
<pre><code>x(y) = i y
z = 6
a(b) = x(b) * (x(b) + 1) / 2
a(z) = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
a(z) = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
</code></pre>
<p>If you now move the cursor onto the 6 in z and use ":", that will push
it out into the invocations of z.  That leaves z with nothing left to
do, so it evaporates:</p>
<pre><code>x(y) = i y
a(b) = x(b) * (x(b) + 1) / 2
a(6) = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
a(6) = 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
</code></pre>
<p>(I'd also like to be able to manipulate programs the way rpn-calc
manipulates algebraic expressions, building them up step by step with
example values.)</p>
<p>During the course of these edits, there are times when a function will
compute multiple values.  For example, consider this definition:</p>
<pre><code>a(b) = x(b) * (x(z) + 1) / 2
</code></pre>
<p>The RPN program is something like this:</p>
<pre><code>local b  b x  z x  1 +  *  2 /
</code></pre>
<p>Upon introducing the second reference to b, but before deleting the z
reference, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>local b  b x  b z x  1 +  *  2 /
</code></pre>
<p>That works out to these expressions:</p>
<pre><code>x(b)
b * (x(z) + 1) / 2
</code></pre>
<p>The question then is whether a, at that point, should be considered to
be returning two values or merely computing x(b) and discarding the
result.</p>
<h2>Vectorization</h2>
<p>To a great extent, not just loops but also nested functions can be
eliminated entirely by sufficient vectorization, so to some extent this
is an alternative to the previous item.  Vectorization is less flexible
but also more comprehensible.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that variables have values that depend on
circumstances, and you can represent pretty much any variable as a
scalar variable that depends on circumstances.  For example, you could
think of the altitude of land as a number, but one that depends on the
latitude and longitude, and maybe time if you are modeling that.  The
textual content of an editor buffer is a character-valued variable that
depends on the position within the buffer.  The country of land is a
categorical measurement which also depends on latitude and longitude.
It is a sensible question what is the maximum altitude for each country,
ranging across all the latitude/longitude pairs within that country.</p>
<p>You could reasonably display such vectors in tables, with one table for
each set of circumstances that a vector's values depend on.  Vectors
depending on the same set of circumstances would be displayed in the
same table.  The traditional way to lay out such tables is with one
attribute per column and one row per instance, but the reverse is
probably better in this case, with one row per formula and one column
per instance.  As you calculated, rows would appear and disappear, with
the formula displayed on their left followed by a sparkline.</p>
<p>It's not totally clear to me how to mix the display of the stack results
with table-style display.  Multiple hierarchical levels of circumstances
are a reasonable thing to have; you could imagine using colspan cells
within the same table to display values that depended on less than the
whole set of circumstances, in particular including the empty set of
circumstances: a scalar or constant.</p>
<p>The objective is to be able to add new circumstances later, as in the
example above in which the altitude comes to depend on time as well as
latitude and longitude; you could also imagine it depending on the
reference spheroid (WGS 84?) and the data source being consulted.  This
suggests that aggregation operations (such as, for example, max) should
specify a list of circumstances to range over all possible values of
(and thus eliminate from the dependency list), rather than a list of
circumstances to retain in the dependency list.</p>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>Often the calculations I'm doing are in terms of the interrelated values
of some mathematical model.  The simplest interesting example is perhaps
a sphere, which has a radius, a diameter, a cross-sectional area, a
surface area, and a volume, any one of which determines all of the
others.  More complex models may involve conditionals, piecewise
approximations from empirical data, and more parameters --- a cylinder,
for example, has a volume, a radius, and a length, any two of which
determine the third, as well as other properties, of course.  It is
desirable to express those relationships once for a given model and then
derive an effective calculation procedure from that expression.</p>
<h2>Units</h2>
<p>It's very common for me to do calculations including measurement
dimensions, and I wish my calculators were better at this.  I often use
units(1) to do the calculations, but it has some shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no way to define variables or functions or vectorize
  calculations;</li>
<li>Its output display defaults to expressing things in terms of
  fundamental units, which is often fairly confusing --- joules or volts,
  let alone farads, are difficult to recognize in that format;</li>
<li>Often the input interpretation is surprising, and you may not notice
  an unexpected interpretation.</li>
