(4 minutes)</div><p>Landsat 8 images are now freely available, including the 15-meter
panchromatic band that was new in the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor.  The
thermal bands have lower resolution than in the L7 sensor, but
whatevs.</p>
<p>An immediate problem is how to deal with the images in the Level 1
Data Product.  They're 16-bit TIFFs with dozens to hundreds of
megapixels; it turns out that, at least on my netbook, things like
ImageMagick (<code>display</code> and <code>convert -sample</code> anyway) and the GIMP just
do not manage to open them in a reasonable amount of RAM.  netpbm
seems to be able to come through here, successfully generating a
thumbnail of a 225-megapixel image in only three minutes:</p>
<pre><code>anytopnm LC82250842013110LGN01_B8.TIF | pnmscale -height=600 | \
    pnmtopng &gt; small-pan.png
</code></pre>
<p>The results in a rather dim, but still 16-bit, image, with a maximum
pixel value of 9007; a contrast autostretch with <code>pgmnorm</code> helps, but
leaves the image proper rather low in contrast, because the black
border pixels are so far from the image values.  <code>pnmhisteq</code> results
in a striking and highly legible grayscale.</p>
<p>In the thumbnail, Buenos Aires is 40x34+365+278 out of the 624x600
image (found with <code>display small-pan.png</code>, then Image Edit → Region of
Interest).  The original image is 15201x14621, according to <code>anytopnm
LC82250842013110LGN01_B8.TIF | head -2</code>.  That means I should be able
to extract a 974x829 image at (8892, 6774) to find the city, using
<code>pamcut</code>:</p>
<pre><code>time anytopnm LC82250842013110LGN01_B8.TIF | \
    pamcut -left 8892 -top 6774 -width 974 -height 829 | \
    pnmtopng &gt; buenos-aires.png &amp;&amp; \
    &lt; buenos-aires.png anytopnm | \
    pnmhisteq | \
    pnmtopng &gt; buenos-aires-stretched.png
</code></pre>
<p>It would be a lot more efficient to break these images up into
compressed tiles of near the latency-bandwidth product of the disk
drive, using <code>pamdice</code>, and mipmap them, rather than spending over a
minute rereading the entire 400-megabyte GeoTIFF for every operation,
but at least it's workable.  The above took a little under 90 seconds,
producing a striking image of most of the city (my RoI was a little
too conservative) in <code>buenos-aires-stretched.png</code>.  Every street and
every plaza is clearly visible, but not every building.  Using
<code>pgmnorm</code> instead of <code>pnmhisteq</code> gives much better results, with
large-scale patterns becoming visible.  The resulting city map is only
about 1.5MB in PNG form or 470kB in JPEG form.</p>
<p>It would probably be a big improvement to add chroma data from the
other bands, but that's a little more work.</p>
<p>Now that it's so easy to get unlimited Landsat 8 scenes, we can quite
reasonably make movies of construction and the like, albeit on a
block-by-block basis rather than a building-by-building basis.  That
is, you'll be able to see which block construction is happening on,
but not what shape the buildings are, unless they're humongous.</p>
<p>(If we figure the latency-bandwidth product is 500kB and that we need
about 1.5 bytes per pixel, the tile size would be around 600×600; this
particular scene would then be 25×26 tiles, and it would probably make
sense to produce 3:1, 9:1, and 27:1 reductions, adding another
1+9+27=37 reduced-size tiles to the original 650; the total would be
some 350MB.  Divide by roughly two to account for the fact that the
zero pixels added around the edges compress to almost nothing.)</p>
<p>Extracting bands 1, 2, and 3 for red, green, and blue, we have</p>
<pre><code>for band in 1 2 3; do 
    time anytopnm "LC82250842013110LGN01_B$band.TIF" |

<p>This produces a somewhat legible color image of the same region as
previously, but it's fairly unsaturated.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
