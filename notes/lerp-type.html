(5 minutes)</div><p>The linear interpolation operation, lerp, is fundamental to a number
of algorithms; you can derive Bézier curves and B-splines from it, it
provides a differentiable version of the conditional operation, and of
course it is directly applied in computer graphics and numerical
computation of all kinds.</p>
<p>There are some interesting questions related to its type.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>It’s sometimes defined as a function of five parameters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lerp5(x₀, x₁, y₀, y₁, x) = y₀ + (x - x₀)·(y₁ - y₀)/(x₁ - x₀)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives you the interpolated value of y at x, given that it should
be y₀ at x₀ and y₁ at x₁.</p>
<p>However, this can be productively decomposed into two functions of
three arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>howfar(x₀, x₁, x) = (x - x₀)/(x₁ - x₀)<br />
lerp(y₀, y₁, t) = y₀ + t·(y₁ - y₀)<br />
lerp5(x₀, x₁, y₀, y₁, x) = lerp(y₀, y₁, howfar(x₀, x₁, x))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is the lerp function defined in the middle there that we are
concerned with.</p>
<p>Given the usual algebraic identities, we can transform its formula
into a different form that is sometimes easier to use.  Writing out
the algebraic transformation in great detail, we have</p>
<blockquote>
<p>y₀ + t·(y₁ - y₀) =<br />
{distributivity}<br />
y₀ + t·y₁ - t·y₀ =<br />
{unity}<br />
1y₀ + t·y₁ - t·y₀ =<br />
{definition of subtraction in terms of adding negative}<br />
1y₀ + t·y₁ + -t·y₀ =<br />
{commutativity}<br />
1y₀ + -t·y₀ + t·y₁ =<br />
{distributivity}<br />
(1 + -t)·y₀ + t·y₁<br />
{definition of subtraction in terms of adding negative}<br />
(1 - t)·y₀ + t·y₁.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m going to consider lerping in domains where some of these
identities don’t apply, and (I assert) it will be interesting to
consider which ones.</p>
<p>This leads to the definition</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lerp2(y₀, y₁, t) = (1 - t)·y₀ + t·y₁</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this was the computation Turing originally proposed to
compute the definition of a conditional branch instruction in his
proposal to build a computer.</p>
<h2>Type signature of lerp</h2>
<p>What are the types of the parameters and result of the lerp function
given above?  They need not all be the same; in the fully general
case, there are six of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lerp(y₀: T₀, y₁: T₁, t: T₂) = y₀ + (t · ((y₁ - y₀): T₃): T₄): T₅</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which gives us the type signatures for the component operations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(x: T₁) - (y: T₀): T₃<br />
(x: T₂) · (y: T₃): T₄<br />
(x: T₀) + (y: T₄): T₅</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, this is sort of vacuous.  But we only have to add a couple
more constraints and it gets interesting!  The usual case in lerping
is that you want the result to be y₀ sometimes, y₁ other times, and
somewhere in between at still other times.  For that to be a coherent
wish, those three values need to have the same type:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>T₀ = T₁ = T₅</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reduces our component operation signatures to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(x: T₀) - (y: T₀): T₃<br />
(x: T₂) · (y: T₃): T₄<br />
(x: T₀) + (y: T₄): T₀</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we arbitrarily add the additional constraint that T₃ = T₄, we have
a simple algebraic structure that looks like an affine space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(x: T₀) - (y: T₀): T₃<br />
(x: T₂) · (y: T₃): T₃<br />
(x: T₀) + (y: T₃): T₀</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here T₀ is the affine space, T₃ is its associated vector space, and T₂
is the underlying scalar field of the vector space.  Computing lerp
doesn’t depend on the validity of any of the eight vector axioms or
the axioms of the affine space, but to the extent that those axioms
hold, more interesting properties will hold of lerp’s results.  For
example, when t=1, normally you want the result to be y₁, but in many
practical cases with floating-point numbers, it won’t be!</p>
<p>To take a concrete example where the three types are different, T₀
might be (the type of) a mapping from a set of (lat, long) pairs to a
temperature reading represented as a floating-point number interpreted
in degrees Celsius; T₃ might be a mapping from a set of (lat, long)
pairs to a temperature difference represented as a floating-point
number interpreted in kelvins; T₂ might be simply a single unitless
floating-point number; and the three arithmetic operations might
operate pointwise on their values.</p>
<p>This is practically useful in finding errors in programs because it is
physically meaningless to multiply a number interpreted in degrees
Celsius by some number.  It is 22°C here right now; if I multiply 22
by 2, getting 44, and then interpret that 44 as 44°C, I have computed
a temperature with no meaningful relationship to the original
temperature.  In Fahrenheit, these temperatures are 71.6°F and
111.2°F.  If a program is doing such a computation, it is very likely
erroneous, although not in every case.</p>
<p>This definition of lerp does not do such a computation.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
