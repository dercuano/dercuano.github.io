(2 minutes)</div><p>If f is a cubic k₀x³ + k₁x² + k₂x + k₃, then f(0) = k₃ is a linear
function of f(-3), f(-1), f(1), and f(3).  Furthermore, the
coefficients for f(-3) and f(3) are equal, as are the coefficients for
f(-1) and f(1).  This means that we can cubic-spline interpolate the
samples at the midpoints of existing sample intervals using only two
multiplications per sample, plus some additions and subtractions.</p>
<p>More specifically, f(1) = k₀ + k₁ + k₂ + k₃, and f(3) = 27k₀ + 9k₁ +
3k₂ + k₃, and f(-1) and f(-3) are the same but with alternating signs.
This gives us this matrix equation:</p>
<pre><code>[-27 9 -3 1]      [f(-3)]
[ -1 1 -1 1] k⃗ = [f(-1)]
[  1 1  1 1]      [ f(1)]
[ 27 9  3 1]      [ f(3)]
</code></pre>
<p>Inverting that matrix with <code>sympy.Matrix(...).inv()</code> gives us:</p>
<pre><code>[-1/48  1/16 -1/16  1/48]
[ 1/16 -1/16 -1/16  1/16]
[ 1/48 -9/16  9/16 -1/48]
[-1/16  9/16  9/16 -1/16]
</code></pre>
<p>Of that, the last row is the one we want, which gives us k₃ = f(0) =
(-f(-3) + 9f(-1) + 9f(1) - f(3))/16.</p>
<p>This means that in fact you don’t need much in the way of
multiplication: you only ever need to multiply samples by 9 when
you’re interpolating between them, which amounts to adding xᵢ&lt;&lt;3 to
xᵢ.  And if you’re doing multiple iterations of interpolation, you
only need to do the multiplication by 9 for the new samples on each
iteration; you don’t need it for the ones you already multiplied by 9
in the previous pass.</p>
<p>Doing the same exercise for quintics, we get:</p>
<pre><code>[-3125 625 -125 25 -5 1]
[ -243  81  -27  9 -3 1]
[   -1   1   -1  1 -1 1]
[    1   1    1  1  1 1]
[  243  81   27  9  3 1]
[ 3125 625  125 25  5 1]

[-1/3840   1/768  -1/384   1/384  -1/768 1/3840]
[  1/768  -1/256   1/384   1/384  -1/256  1/768]
[  1/384 -13/384  17/192 -17/192  13/384 -1/384]
[ -5/384  13/128 -17/192 -17/192  13/128 -5/384]
[-3/1280  25/768 -75/128  75/128 -25/768 3/1280]
[  3/256 -25/256  75/128  75/128 -25/256  3/256]
</code></pre>
<p>So we get [3 -25 75 75 -25 3]/256, which requires 3 multiplications
per input sample for a single pass, or 1½ in the limit for many
passes.</p>
<p>In two dimensions the situation is hairier.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
