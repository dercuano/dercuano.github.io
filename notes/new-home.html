(13 minutes)</div><p>I have moved in with Nuria Pucci.  I am writing this reclining on a
foam mattress on the floor of my new bedroom.  </p>
<p>I’ve paid the rent until the end of the month.  I don’t yet know how
to access the internet connection or flush the toilet; in the morning
I will see if I can take a shower.  I need a Gatorade bottle for
emergency urination, since there’s only one bathroom.</p>
<p>I have a minimal amount of stuff here now: a sleeping bag, a sheet, a
pillow, Tuga, some food, melatonin, my netbook.  I need to move the
rest ASAP.</p>
<p>The room is roughly cubical with a side of some four meters, for a
total volume of 64m³ or 64kℓ.  There are no bookshelves or curtains as
such.  I suspect I can put bookshelves up.</p>
<p>It’s almost 2 AM, and Nuria is running the microwave and playing the
guitar.  So I will need earplugs, too.</p>
<h2>It’s cold</h2>
<p>The room contains about 64kg of air, which has a specific heat of
about 1 J/g/K = 1 kJ/kg/K.  Raising the temperature of these 64kg of
air from its current 10° up to a comfortable 20° thus requires about
640kJ.  As I operate at about 100 W, this would take about two hours.</p>
<p>However, the walls are presumably concrete (0.9 J/g/K) or gypsum
plaster (1.1 J/g/K), and will probably absorb most of the heat I put
into the air — if they don’t simply conduct it outdoors.  The walls
weigh a great deal more than 64kg, although the speed at which the
heat penetrates them will depend on how much of their mass is engaged.</p>
<p>This suggests that hanging fluffy curtains on the walls and perhaps
something similar on the ceiling might make the room a great deal more
comfortable.</p>
<p>If I were to fill a 20ℓ bucket with hot water (4.2 J/g/K) at 50°, in
cooling down to 10°, it would release 160kJ.  Thus, four such buckets
would be needed to bring the room’s air up to a comfortable
temperature.</p>
<h3>Phase-change heat reservoir</h3>
<p>A eutectic mixture of Glauber’s salt and sodium chloride melts at 18°,
with a heat of fusion of 286 kJ/kg, and so it would be adequate to
bring the temperature up to there; a slightly smaller amount of sodium
chloride would melt instead at 20°, slightly less sharply.  2.2
kilograms of such a mixture in its liquid form would suffice to supply
the same heat as all four buckets of water.</p>
<p>If we were to scale up such a system by a factor of 20, we would have
a reservoir of 44 kg of phase-change material (30 ℓ at 1.46 g/cc) with
12.6 MJ of phase-change heat capacity; we could also choose a
different phase-change temperature.  A glazed flat-plate solar heat
collector with a water-ethanol mixture pumped through it could provide
the heat input; a thermosiphon-driven heat exchanger inside the room,
mounted above the reservoir, would silently release the heat into the
air when a valve was opened, at which point it would drive convective
air circulation through a “chimney” above the heat exchanger.</p>
<p>Running this system for four hours at night would provide 870 watts of
heating, which is probably plenty.  It could perhaps be charged over a
longer period of time during the day; if it only had a single hour to
charge in, it would need 3.5 kWt of sunlight; with a 50%-efficient
glazed flat-plate collector, that’s about 7 m².</p>
<p>The standard chimney draft calculation is</p>
<pre><code>Q = C A √(2 g H ΔT/T)
</code></pre>
<p>where Q is the draft flow rate, A is the cross-sectional area of the
chimney, C is a discharge coefficient of about 0.7, g is the
gravitational acceleration, H is the height, ΔT is the temperature
difference across the chimney wall, and T is the temperature outside.</p>
<p>Let’s say A = 0.01 m², H = 3 m, T = 288 K, ΔT = 5 K; then our flow
rate is 7ℓ/s, at which rate sucking all 64kℓ of air through the system
would take about 2½ hours, which is a bit too slow.  Correcting to
0.05m², we suck all the room’s air through the heater every 30
minutes, which is acceptable; this amounts to a round chimney duct of
some 250 mm in diameter.</p>
<p>44 kg of Glauber’s salt at the wholesale price of US$130/tonne would
cost US$5.72, currently about AR$80.</p>
<p>The 30 liters would need to have plumbing run through it rather
thoroughly in order to be able to freeze all of the salt during the
heat-evolution part of the cycle.  Wikipedia says that sodium chloride
has a thermal conductivity of 6.5 W/m/K at 289 K, but I’m not sure how
to apply that information to figure out how closely the pipes need to
be spaced.</p>
<p>Well, kind of.  Let’s say the pipes are spaced 50 mm apart, so the
heat has to travel 25 mm from a pipe to reach the last liquid salt.
If you slice 30 ℓ into 50 mm slices, the surface area of the slices is
0.6 m², or 1.2 m² on both sides.  The coolant is presumably halfway
between the air temperature, which might be 18°, and the salt’s
freezing temperature, which might be 22°, so you have a gradient of
only 2 K on average over those 25 mm: 80 K/m; multiplying the surface
area in, you get 96 K m.  That’s 624 W, which is probably acceptable.
If the pipe spacing were smaller, you would have proportionally more
layers and less distance to the last liquid, so the power goes as the
inverse square of the pipe spacing.</p>
<p>Spacing zero-thickness pipes 50 mm apart throughout a 30 ℓ volume in a
square pattern would require 12 m of pipes.  (I’m not sure how much it
affects the surface area of the last or nearly last liquid salt, or
whether that matters.)  You can do slightly better by using a
hexagonal pattern, but then again, you will do slightly worse because
the coils have to bend in order to fill the whole space.  So this is
probably about right.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if it matters to the heat transfer into the salt whether
you run the pipes in parallel or purely in series.</p>
<p>12 m of 5mm-diameter pipe holds 236mℓ of coolant, almost exactly one
US cup, which is a comfortingly small number for the most hazardous
part of the system.  If it had the specific heat of water, with that
same 2° ΔT, it would transfer about 2.0 kJ of heat each circuit; this
is too small, because at 870 W, it would have to make a circuit of the
entire reservoir every 2.3 seconds, 5.3 meters per second.  That’s far
too fast, but it might be bearable if you can run a lot of pipes in
parallel instead of in series.  Just in case, though, it’s probably
better to think in terms of 10mm-diameter pipe, 940mℓ of coolant,
7.9 kJ, and 9.1 seconds of reservoir transit time.</p>
<p>We probably need turbulent flow for maximum heat transfer power, so we
want the Reynolds number in the pipes to be over 4000; but not too
much over 4000, because we lose efficiency.  If Re = vD/ν, solving for
v, we get v = ν Re / D.  If D = 10mm, ν = 1 cSt = 1 mm²/s, and Re =
4000, then v = 0.4 m/s; at 9.1 seconds of reservoir transit time, this
suggests we’d need to split the reservoir coolant into branches of
about 3.6 m each.</p>
<p>400 mm/s seems like a lot to expect out of a thermosiphon.  How can we
fix that?  If the pipes were thinner, we would need an even higher
velocity to hit Re = 4000, which seems counterintuitive; for example,
at 5mm, we need 0.8 m/s.  But that really is the way it works: thicker
pipes, where viscosity matters less, are more prone to turbulence.  So
apparently the cure is to use thicker pipes still in order to get
turbulent flow at a lower speed.</p>
<p>Let’s say we go to 20mm diameter, at which point we can afford 36
seconds of reservoir transit time, because the coolant holds 32 kJ,
because there are 3.8 liters of it.  Now we get turbulent flow at 0.2
m/s, at which speed we would transit all 12 meters of pipe serially in
60 seconds, so we still do better if we split the pipe into two
parallel runs.</p>
<p>How much pressure do we need to get to 0.2 m/s in 12 meters of 20mm
pipe, though?</p>
<p>The Darcy-Weisbach equation says</p>
<pre><code>Δp = f L ρ v² / (2 D)
</code></pre>
<p>where f is the Darcy friction factor, L is the length of the pipe, ρ
is the density of the liquid, v is the velocity as before, and D is
the diameter as before.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have a Moody diagram handy to figure out what f
should be.  The Haaland equation, a simple approximation to the
recurrent Colebrook equation, says:</p>
<pre><code>1/√f = -1.8 log₁₀ ((ε/D/3.7)¹·¹¹ + 6.9/Re)
</code></pre>
<p>where ε is the surface roughness and D is the diameter, as before.
The relative roughness ε/D here should be about 0.01 to 0.001, so that
part of the sum could work out to be as high as .0014, or much lower;
6.9/4000 is about .0017.  So our logarithm here is about -2.5 to -2.8,
so 1/√f ≈ 4.5 to 5, so f should be in the neighborhood of 0.04 or
0.05.  [Later I checked this against a Moody chart and, yes, .045 to
.055.] </p>
<p>The original Colebrook equation says</p>
<pre><code>1/√f = -2 log₁₀ (ε/D/3.7 + 2.51/(Re√f))
</code></pre>
<p>Just checking here, Re√f ≈ 800, ε/D/3.7 ≈ .0027, 2.51/800 ≈ .0031, the
logarithm is about -2.2, and yes, that means 1/√f ≈ 4.5.</p>
<p>Back to the Darcy-Weisbach equation, we have f = 0.04, L = 12 m, ρ = 1
g/cc, v = 0.2 m/s, D = 20 mm, which works out to 480 Pa of head loss.
Or only 240 Pa if we split it in half.  That’s 0.03 psi, which kind of
sounds reasonable, but it’s 24.5 mm of water head, which seems like it
might be hard to get out of a thermosiphon.</p>
<p>This all depends on the thermal coefficient of expansion of water,
which notoriously falls to zero at 4°, then goes negative.  Mixing
ethanol into the water might help with this, both because it serves as
antifreeze and because its own TCE is very large, much larger than
water’s.  Wikipedia [[Thermal expansion]] claims that water’s
volumetric coefficient is 207 ppm/K at 20°; if we have a 2 K
difference between the hot side and the cold side of the thermosiphon,
then we have 414 ppm.  That would mean we needed 59 meters of height
to get our thermosiphon to siphon at 240 Pa with only 2 K difference.</p>
<p>So, no, you won’t get turbulent flow through the heat exchanger from
the thermosiphon.  That’s too much to ask from a poor little bedroom
thermosiphon.</p>
<p>What will happen in reality if you have, say, 1 m of thermosiphon
height?  (We’re running out of height here in the bedroom...)</p>
<p>414 ppm of a meter is 414 microns, which works out to about 4 Pa.
Let’s solve Darcy-Weisbach for v:</p>
<pre><code>Δp = f L ρ v² / (2 D)
Δp 2 D / f L ρ = v²
v = √(Δp 2 D / f L ρ)
</code></pre>
<p>So in this case we have Δp = 4 Pa, D = 20 mm, f we don’t know but for
laminar flow it’s 64/Re, L = 6 m, ρ = 1 g/cc.  But wait, actually L
depends on how many pipes we put in parallel through the reservoir; it
might be 500mm if we put 24 parallel pipes there instead of two.  Or
250mm if we put 48 pipes in.  We were only going with two in order to
try to get turbulent flow.</p>
<p>I think that shows that we can get almost arbitrarily high heat
transfer powers out of almost arbitrarily low coolant volumes by
putting the coolant through lots of pipes in parallel.  But I’m not
going to finish the calculations tonight.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
