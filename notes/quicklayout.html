(3 minutes)</div><p>I want to explore how to do text layout and rendering at 100fps on one
core, in particular for a kind of greenfield computing system.  A few
different obstacles present themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>I probably need to hack up something involving SDL in C or something
  similar in order to see if I’ve succeeded.</li>
<li>I don’t know what text layout is.  Are we talking about displaying
  one line on top of another?  Word wrap?  TeX-style hboxes, vboxes,
  and stretchy glue?  Tk-style packing on different sides of nested
  boxes?  The CSS box model?  Arbitrary Linogram-style linear
  constraint systems?  Arbitrary constraint or optimization systems?</li>
<li>How much do I need to lay out other than the stuff that appears on
  the screen?  If I can get away with only doing layout for what I am
  actually rendering, then the 100fps constraint is not nearly as
  difficult as if I need to do layout for a bunch of earlier and later
  text as well in order to figure out how wide my column is and where
  to start.</li>
<li>What font do I use?  Font and text rendering might take a
  significant amount of computation time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've done a couple of things like this in the past.
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dofonts">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dofonts</a> and
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dofonts-1k">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dofonts-1k</a> are fixed-width font
renderers in JS, the second in under 1 kilobyte of DHTML, including
the font.
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/netbook-misc-devel/propfontrender.py">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/netbook-misc-devel/propfontrender.py</a>
is a proportional pixel-font renderer in Python.  It’s about 4
kilobytes of Python.  All three have their own fonts and do letter
wrap but not word wrap.
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/inexorable-misc/wordwrap.py">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/inexorable-misc/wordwrap.py</a> is a
word-wrap algorithm in 16 lines of Python.
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/netbook-misc-devel/telegram.py">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/netbook-misc-devel/telegram.py</a> has a
couple of different word-wrap algorithms, one of which is 12 lines.  I
haven’t done much in the way of boxes-and-glue layout.</p>
<p>There are a few different first things I could do on this.  I could
hack together a thing with C and SDL that generates bitmaps (without
text in them) and puts them on the screen.  I could hack together a
thing in Python or JS that lays out boxes with some kind of
boxes-and-glue model.  I could write a thing in Python or JS that
converts a boxes-and-glue spec into a sparse matrix of linear
constraints, and use (or write) a solver for it.</p>
<p>A fun example to try doing layout on would be some equations and
program code.</p>
<p>Ultimately the objective is to run a thing in C that I can benchmark
to see how far I am from 100fps and what the critical path is.</p>
<p>Okay, now I am rendering 12 megabytes per second of input text (250
megapixels of output) on my netbook, which would be 120 kilobytes of
text or 2.5 megapixels at 100fps.  On my laptop I can do 70 megabytes
per second of input text on one core.  This is with the code in
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/propfont.c">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/propfont.c</a>.  This is still far
from memcpy-limited, so I can probably do better.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
