<h2>The Olivetti Programma 101 in 1964 and its VWXZ keys</h2>
<p>I was reading about the Olivetti Programma 101 desktop computer today.
It cost US$3200 when it came out in 1964; they sold forty thousand of
them.  It could be used as a printing calculator (LED displays were
still in the future) and you could load a 120-instruction program from
a magnetic card.  Its magnetostrictive delay-line memory was somewhat
anemic at some 240 bytes, circulating with a bit over 2 milliseconds
of cycle time.  It’s one of the reasonable contenders for the title of
“first personal computer”.</p>
<p>The thing that struck me as interesting about this machine was that
four of the buttons (labeled V, W, X, and Z) were “start program”
buttons: they jumped to four of the thirty-two available labels.  So
you could write an interactive program that enhanced the calculator’s
capabilities with four new functions invoked with these keys.  When
the calculator finished feeding the magnetic card through the reader,
it would come to rest atop these keys, so it could bear human-readable
labels for them, explaining what the newly-loaded program had
programmed them to do.</p>
<h2>The keyboard <em>is</em> the instruction set</h2>
<p>RPN calculators, of which I assume the Programma was one, enjoy a
pleasantly simple way of programming them: the sequence of
computational steps to execute is the same as the sequence of
keystrokes to do the same computation interactively, and parameter
passing and result return is implicit.  The difference is just that in
“program” mode, the program steps are added to a program instead of
being executed.  (The user experience might arguably be better if you
did that <em>as well as</em> executing them, rather than <em>instead of</em>
executing them, but for it to be an actual improvement over the
traditional HP experience, that probably requires enough screen real
estate to simultaneously display the program steps being recorded and
the example values.)</p>
<p>This means, in effect, that your CPU instruction set is simultaneously
your user interface, which suggests that you might have instructions
for such odd keystrokes as “multiply the current top of stack by 10
and add 5”.  These are obviously far easier to implement as code than
as transistors, and as a result machines like the HP 9100A were
heavily microcoded, to the point that they had to invent a new kind of
ROM to store the calculator’s microcode.</p>
<p>The VWXZ approach, however, suggests an alternative to microcoding:
implement most or all keys as procedure calls rather than a CPU
instruction.  Better yet, implement them as CPU instructions that call
particular subroutines.  Then, you can avoid microcode and the need to
have two levels of programmability in your computer.  If you can spare
the RAM space for a sort of “interrupt vector” for these keys, then
you can make those keys and those instructions reprogrammable.</p>
<p>(If you can do this and also write some kind of idle-time handler that
runs when the computer is waiting for an instruction from the keyboard
and doesn’t get one, you can incrementally extend the computer’s
instruction set into an arbitrary application.)</p>
<h2>How teensy can you make the machine?</h2>
<p>We probably can’t make do with 32 instructions and keys on the
keyboard.  A modern “four-function” calculator has the digits, “.”,
“=”, +, -, ×, ÷, MR/C, M+, M-, ON/C, CE, +/-, √, and %, a total of 24
keys; you probably need at least those instructions or their stack
equivalents for a usable calculator, plus more than 8 instructions
that aren’t one of those keys.  So you probably need at least 64
keys and instructions, which is what the HP 9100A had.</p>
<p>How much space do you need for a program address?  The HP 9100A needed
a 32-kibibit ROM for its microcode, which is also how much RAM the
late-1970s personal computers needed for a BASIC interpreter; the
9100A also could hold 14 6-bit instructions per register, of which it
had 23 implemented as core memory, for a total of 23·14·6 = 1932 more
bits.  This was sufficiently limiting that they started shipping an HP
9100B within the year with double the RAM, 3864 bits
<a href="http://www.hp9825.com/html/the_9100_part_2.html">http://www.hp9825.com/html/the_9100_part_2.html</a>.  The earlier
Olivetti had 240 bytes of delay-line memory, which I suspect were
6-bit bytes; this gives a similar number of 1440 bits.</p>
<p>Let’s figure that stack-machine code will probably be a bit more
compact than the 9100A’s microcode, especially with magic
procedure-call instructions, but not all that much, maybe a factor of
2 or 3.  Then you need something like ten kibibits of program memory,
a bit over 1700 instructions.  You could impose, say, a four-
instruction alignment requirement on the vectors for the keys, which
would cut the vector size down to 9 bits.  So vectors for all 64
possible instructions would require only 576 bits, 6% of total memory.
Of course you need hard-wired functions for some instructions.</p>
<p>You can probably make do with half of the program memory space being
ROM.</p>
<p>So how is this shaping up?  We have an interactively usable, fully
programmable computer whose memory space consists of 512 24-bit words,
of which half are ROM and half are RAM, for a total of 6144 bits of
RAM, 59% more than the HP 9100B.  16 of the 256 words of RAM contain
32 instruction addresses (plus six leftover bits) that define the
meanings of 32 of the 64 possible six-bit instructions (and keys); the
other 32 instructions are hard-wired, perhaps taken from the F18a
core.  Those 240 words of RAM can contain 960 instructions, which can
invoke routines in the other 1024 instructions stored in ROM.  These
are stack-machine instructions, so you have to spend about half of them
on stack manipulation to make up for not having operand fields,
so this is roughly comparable to 1000
machine instructions for the 386 or SPARC
(500 in RAM, 500 in ROM): barely enough for a simple
compiler or assembler, plenty for a video game, and probably not
enough for a working TCP/IP stack.</p>
<p>(It’s a great deal more than the 1024 bits of RAM in the Atari 2600 or
the 1152 bits of RAM in an F18a core, but less than the 16384 bits of
RAM in an ATMega328 Arduino, and dramatically less than its 262144
bits of Flash.)</p>
<p>But these 6144 bits of RAM, if implemented as electronic static RAM,
will need 12288 transistors — very likely more than the entire
processor, maybe even if it’s bit-parallel and includes a multiplier.
If you could get that memory complexity down a bit, you would have a
computer that could scale to much more complex tasks.  But this is
probably enough to bootstrap with.</p>
<p>If you’re building the CPU out of mechanical logic, six 16-position
sliders give you a 24-bit word of RAM.  All 256 words, then, can be
stored in 1536 such sliders.  This is more complicated than a Curta
calculator or a pocket watch, but not in the same world of difficulty
as many mechanical machines that already physically exist.  In fact,
it’s probably a lot less demanding than the Jaquet-Droz automata.</p>
<h2>Comparison to the GreenArrays F18A</h2>
<p>The F18A has a ten-item parameter stack and IIRC a nine-item control
stack; more deeply nested code will not be able to return.  In its
case, since they’re 18 bits wide, they amount to 342 bits.  On this
hypothetical machine, your parameter stack would be 24 bits, but the
return stack could be narrower, as little as 11 bits if you didn’t
want to use it for loop counters; so you could still fit ten
parameters and nine return addresses into 350 bits, which is 5.7% of
the size of the RAM and therefore probably a good investment.</p>
<p>(The F18A also has some named memory pointer registers, one of which
is also used for multiplication, and a few other miscellaneous
features.)</p>
<h2>Arithmetic overflow and usability</h2>
<p>My experience with integer math in computer programs is that I have to
think about overflow incessantly with 8-bit variables, frequently with
16-bit variables, and almost never with 32-bit variables.  I have no
experience programming with 24-bit variables, but it seems like they
would probably be pretty easy.  Maybe I should be thinking about
floating point.</p>
<p>So the experience of bootstrapping this machine is probably that the
bare CPU gives you a 24-bit integer hexadecimal or octal arithmetic
calculator with addition, subtraction, and maybe multiplication, and
then you can write programs for division, square roots, logarithms,
transcendental functions, and whatnot.  Or you can instead write
programs that don’t care about transcendental functions and instead do
other things, like assemblers and BASIC interpreters, so you can
bootstrap to higher levels of abstraction.</p>
<h2>Modeless machine-code programming by example</h2>
<p>You could maybe eliminate the distinction between compiling and
interpreting modes by always recording the user’s keystrokes into some
memory buffer or other, thus always preserving the option of executing
them later.  (See <a href="../notes/cpu-with-knobs.html">A two-operand calculator supporting programming by demonstration</a> for more elaboration on this
theme, in a non-stack-machine context.)</p>
<h2>Display refresh, task segments, and multithreading</h2>
<p>If you’re executing machine code interactively to do calculations, you
probably want to see the values you’re operating on.  If the CPU has
registers (for example, a top-of-operand-stack and
next-on-operand-stack register), you probably want to see those
registers rather than, say, some memory location.  But more advanced
applications might want to display something custom, which might not
be numbers.  One way to do this would be for hardware to copy these
registers onto the display every, say, 15 or 20 milliseconds; if the
system that does this raises an interrupt a little earlier, then a
custom interrupt handler could arrange to set those registers to the
desired display value for a few dozen microseconds.  Another way would
be to update the display explicitly rather than implicitly, possibly
also from a timer interrupt handler.</p>
<p>This ties in with how the machine’s control flow weaves together
keyboard response, background-task service, and interruption of
accidental infinite loops.  A standard single-threaded computer runs a
top-level infinite event loop with its PC either at a halt instruction
or running some background task most of the time; when you press a
key, an interrupt is raised, the background task is suspended (or the
halt is raised), and the PC moves into the keyboard interrupt handler;
this buffers a keystroke and perhaps sets a flag or two, and upon
return, the main event loop takes note of the keystroke (sooner or
later) and acts upon it, perhaps invoking other subroutines.</p>
<p>Here we’re proposing that the PC normally be pointing <em>to the
keyboard</em>, such that when the CPU attempts to fetch an instruction,
the fetch blocks until a key is pressed; possibly a timer interrupt
might interrupt the blocked fetch from time to time, running some
background task, before resuming the blocked fetch; when the keystroke
executes, it may call some other subroutine, pushing the address of
the keyboard onto the stack for a while until the subroutine finishes
and the CPU awaits the next keystroke.</p>
<p>One consequence of this is that you need some way to keep the PC from
incrementing out of the keyboard space.  This could be done with
saturating arithmetic (placing the keyboard at the end of the address
space), an equivalent special case in the PC increment logic at some
other arbitrary address, or in a non-special-case way by limiting the
width of the PC increment logic.  For example, you could simply omit
the carry out of the 7th bit of the PC (and everything beyond), such
that every 128 memory words formed a separate “task segment” — if
control falls off the end of one, it just wraps back to its beginning.
Then you memory-map the keyboard to an entire task segment.  (I think
I got this solution from the GreenArrays chips, but of course an 8086
will do much the same thing — IP is a 16-bit register and doesn't
overflow into CS; if you execute off the end of a 64K code segment, it
will wrap back to the beginning.)</p>
<p>However, in this model, quite aside from how it may or may not handle
PC incrementation, two problems are not entirely resolved.  First, how
do you recover control if you accidentally invoke an infinite loop
which never returns into the keyboard address space?  Second, how can
a best-effort background task (as opposed to an isochronous task like
updating the display or incrementing an RTC) yield its time slice to
interactive computation?  After all, from the point of view of an
interrupt handler, the difference between being invoked when the
machine is idle and while it’s running some computation is just a
matter of whether it’s returning to the keyboard’s address or
somewhere else; it would be ugly to have it introspect that in order
to decide whether to return before doing its quantum of work.</p>
<p>I’m not yet convinced there’s a clean solution to those problems
within the keyboard-is-instruction-set, no-monitor-program-needed
constraint.</p>
<h2>The 8080 RST instruction and keyboard bucky bits</h2>
<p>Each instruction on the Intel 8080 was one byte, not counting possible
operand bytes following the opcode byte in the instruction stream, so
there were only 256 possible instructions.  8 of these precious slots
were given over to an “RST” instruction, glossed “restart”, which
included a 3-bit operand field “nnn”; in octal, it had the opcode
03N3.  These called a subroutine at address 000 0N0 (again, in octal),
and the machine’s hardware interrupt, as I understand it, invoked the
eighth of these eight subroutines in the same way as if an RST 7
instruction had been issued.</p>
<p>Since they called a subroutine in the usual way, pushing the PC on the
stack, the code thus invoked could RET to the program that had invoked
the RST instruction (or that happened to be running when the hardware
interrupt arose), which would then continue its execution as if
nothing untoward had happened.  In essence, the eight RST instructions
provided eight programmable opcodes, vectored to subroutines in RAM or
ROM.</p>
<p>The question arises: if some of your opcodes are such vectorable
subroutine calls, and you’re relying on this for your user interface,
what is the proper number of them to have?  The Olivetti Programma
101’s four programmable keys is probably too few, as is the 8080’s
eight RST opcode bytes.  You usually want to have more than eight
actions available to the user at any given time when they are using an
application, especially if they are going to be composing text.  And
it’s reasonable to think that high-level application code might
consist largely of calls to existing subroutines, although some amount
of immediate data is surely needed; being able to vector a significant
chunk of the instruction set to such subroutines might be a really
cool way to extend the instruction set in an application-specific way,
taking language-oriented programming down to the machine-code level.</p>
<p>One constraint here is the physical keyboard size.  The keyboard I’m
typing this on has 88 keys, like a piano.  (It’s a “Genius” “Luxemate
100” USB keyboard chosen because it was cheap and small enough to
easily fit into my backpack, despite having kind of a shitty feel and
a non-coiling cord.)  A minimal typewriter-style keyboard probably has
around 50 keys, as does the “Cifra SC-9100” scientific calculator I
profiled in <a href="../notes/scicalc-usability.html">Usability of scientific calculators</a>.  A keyboard with 256 or 512 keys
would be unwieldy.  Even the 101-key keyboards that are common on PCs
nowadays are unwieldy; you can’t reach most of their keys without
moving your hands.  The Android 4 on-screen keyboard on the phone I
have here has only 34 keys, and it requires constant mode-switching
and autocorrect to approximate usability.  Termux, a Unix CLI
environment for Android, adds 17 more keys, bringing the total to 51,
and does reach a more reasonable level of usability.</p>
<p>StoneKnifeForth, which is an i386 compiler that compiles itself into a
Linux ELF executable in two pages of source code (or 7 pages counting
comments), consists of 50 subroutines and variables.  More elaborate
software modules need more, but probably it’s only rarely useful to
have many times more subroutines accessible than that.</p>
<p>So, an interesting design alternative: have an 8-bit instruction set
of which 64 bytes — perhaps the ones corresponding to ASCII digits and
lowercase — are directly generated by the keyboard and vectored like
the 8080’s RST instructions are vectored:</p>
<pre><code>  +  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f
0x20   ! " # $ % &amp; ' ( ) * + , - . /
0x30 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; &lt; = &gt; ?
0x60 ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o
0x70 p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~ DEL
</code></pre>
<p>This omits uppercase letters, @, [, \, ], ^, _, and the control
characters other than DEL; none of these are essential for arithmetic,
and this was probably a deliberate design decision on the part of the
ASCII committee: a single contiguous 32-character chunk of the code
space is adequate for FORTRAN, except for the alphabet.</p>
<p>In addition to these 64 keys, corresponding directly to bytes that
invoke subroutine calls in the CPU, you can have two “bucky keys” to
generate the rest of the possible 8-bit bytes.  One of them (“Meta”)
should obviously set the high bit, while the other one probably needs
to act like Shift for the lowercase letters, which is to say that it
maps 0x61 to 0x41, 0x70 to 0x50, and so on.  The simplest thing for
this “Shift” to do would be to clear the 0x20 bit, which would map the
digits and most punctuation to control characters.  In particular,
backspace would be shift-“(“, tab would be shift-“)”, CR would be
shift-“-”, and LF would be shift-“*”.  This may be too outré to use
in practice, although at least DEL is on a key of its own.</p>
<p>Traditional keyboards, as represented by libvte and xterm anyway,
ignore Ctrl for pretty much everything in the 0x20 and 0x30 rows,
except that Ctrl-/ yields ^_, US.</p>
<p>The idea is that, even if the majority of the keys on the keyboard
correspond to vectored-subroutine instructions, some key combinations
would instead correspond to hardwired instructions that would allow
you to regain control and rebootstrap the system even if the
subroutines attached to your normal keys got horked.</p>
<p>(Consider instead the approach of providing “Shift” and “Ctrl” keys
that individually do what you would expect: shift-a is A, ctrl-j is
SOH, shift-j is J, ctrl-j is LF.  So shift must map 0x60 to 0x40 and
0x70 to 0x50, while ctrl maps 0x60 to 0x00 and 0x70 to 0x10.  But
technically that leaves open the shift mapping and the ctrl mapping
for 0x20 and 0x30, as well as the ctrl-shift mapping for everything.
For example, you could have shift map 0x20 and 0x30 to 0xa0 and 0xb0,
ctrl-shift map 0x20 and 0x30 to 0x80 and 0x90 and map 0x60 and 0x70 to
0xc0 and 0xd0, and ctrl map 0x20 and 0x30 to 0xe0 and 0xf0.  There’s
probably a viable option in this space that can be achieved with a few
logic gates, but for now I will leave the option open.  Furthermore,
for now I won’t consider the possibility of a second bucky bit for a
Meta key, or a third bucky bit for key release events, although
detecting long key presses is clearly necessary for many important
applications, such as Tetris.  These suggest nine- or ten-bit
instruction “bytes”, which would be mostly vectored subroutines.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
