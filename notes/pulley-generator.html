(2 minutes)</div><p>Could you use a low-friction pulley system to directly drive a tiny
micro-DC motor as a micro-generator from a hanging weight?  A typical
US$3 micro-DC motor can handle about 1–2W of power and produce .49
mN·m of torque, which at a wheel radius of 5mm, is 9.8mN, the Earth
weight of 10g.  If your weight is, say, 10kg, you need a 1000:1 pulley
system; if it is raised through 2m of distance, a simple
block-and-tackle would mean you need 500 pulleys at the top, 500
below, and 1000 iterations of thread running between them, for a total
of 2000 meters of fine thread.  (The thread would ideally be
impractically fine: 28 microns of most materials would be sufficient,
for a total cross-sectional area of 2.4 mm², and much less of
high-strength materials.)</p>
<p>To avoid this massive number of parts and threads, it’s probably
better to use a multi-stage system: five sequential 4:1 reductions,
for example, using gears or pulleys or whatever.  A regular 40/3
cotton thread at 4 grams per denier should be able to support 2.7 kg,
so maybe 4 to 16 threads running between 4 to 16 pulleys, followed by
a 64:1 to 256:1 reduction gearbox or belt drive.  (A 32:1 belt-drive
reduction could perhaps be done in a single stage, reducing losses,
with a 32-cm wheel and a 1-cm wheel; two 16:1 stages would provide
256:1.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/pricing.html">Pricing</a> (89 notes)
