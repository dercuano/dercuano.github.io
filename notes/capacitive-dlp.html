(1 minute)</div><p>I was writing in <a href="../notes/paper-foil-relays.html">Paper/foil relays</a> about macroscopic
electrostatic relays made from paper and graphite.  Metal foil is
another potential material for such devices, which deflect an
insulator bearing conductive contacts using the electrostatic force on
a conductive plate mounted on the insulator.  Metal foil can also be
mirror-reflective, which means that by deflecting it in this way, you
can also redirect light.  Indeed, as described in <a href="../notes/caustic-business-card.html">Caustic business card</a>, even submicron deflection of the foil surface
can be sufficient to produce visible reflection effects nearby.  You
could produce such deflections fairly quickly and with fairly low
voltages.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
