(1 minute)</div><p>The Codex Arundel is a codex of manuscripts from Leonardo da Vinci,
made of 283 sheets of paper, each with a recto and a verso side.  The
British Library has scanned it at 8579×6250 pixels, divided into
256-pixel-square tiles with one pixel of overlap, each about 12
kilobytes, fetchable using wget.  This works out to 34×25 tiles per
side of a page, so the total number of tiles is (* 34 25 283 2) =
481,100, and the total weight of the work should be about 5.8
gigabytes.</p>
<p>Initially each of the 566 images loads as an image of about 1800×800,
about 2.7% of the total size.  It would make some sense to fetch these
low-resolution images first (totaling 160 megabytes) before making the
possibly doomed effort to fetch the whole dataset.</p>
