(2 minutes)</div><p>I was reading Raphael Finkel’s book “Advanced Programming Language
Design”, and he mentions a language somebody named Finkel invented in
the 1970s called AL.  AL had dimensional analysis built in, with four
base dimensions: ‘time’, ‘distance’, ‘angle’, and ‘mass’.</p>
<p>(As Finkel says, this is the kind of “type safety” that’s really
needed in everyday calculations.  His language did it statically, but
you can do it dynamically too, as units(1) does.)</p>
<p>He points out that ‘angle’ really shouldn’t be included since radians
are really dimensionless, which leaves us with ‘time’, ‘distance’, and
‘mass’.  But no ‘speed’, ‘force’ or ‘energy’.</p>
<p>However, they can be derived from the base units; speed is a ratio
distance/time — e.g., m/s.  Acceleration is speed/time, or m/s², and
force can be thought of as mass * acceleration, or kg*m/s².  Finally,
energy is force * distance, so you can express it in units of
kg*m²/s².  This is in fact how units(1) represents it.</p>
<p>But do we really need all three of ‘time’, ‘distance’, and ‘mass’?
The speed of light provides a natural conversion factor between time
and distance, and mass can be equivalently measured as energy,
according to the well-known formula E = mc².  So speed is really just
a dimensionless quantity, and acceleration is the reciprocal of a time
interval, namely the time to reach the speed of light at that constant
acceleration; so its units are really 1/s.  So force can really be
measured merely with kg/s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this doesn’t really help us get rid of mass: energy is
now expressed in kg*s/s, or merely kg.  So our two relativity-based
equivalences (mass as energy, and time as distance) turned out to be
merely two facets of the same equivalence.</p>
<p>But I suspect that in everyday calculations, the equivalence of mass
and energy is rarely useful; it’s far more likely to hide errors than
to reduce the amount of work necessary.  With time, distance, and
mass, the only incommensurable quantities I commonly run into with
commensurable units are:</p>
<ul>
<li>torque and energy;</li>
<li>various dimensionless quantities;</li>
<li>perhaps pressure and stress;</li>
<li>stress and young’s modulus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collapsing mass with energy and time with distance creates many more
“units collisions”.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
