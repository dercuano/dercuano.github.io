<p>There are lots of ways to heat things up to, for example, fire
ceramics.  Setting things on fire is probably the most fun way, but
it’s inefficient and hard to control.  You can also concentrate
sunlight, absorb microwaves, or run electricity through refractory
wires.</p>
<p>Suppose we reduce the kiln problem to make it easier: we have no
convection, and we just want to heat the kiln to 660°, the melting
point of aluminum, using one of the three non-fire methods.  And let’s
say we’re satisfied with a kiln about the size of a sake cup: 50mm
across, 60mm tall, 118mℓ.  How much insulation do we need?</p>
<p>(Note that in the sunlight case, you also need a sufficient solar
concentration factor, which works out to be 42 suns, 4.2 million lux.)</p>
<p>Well, of course, that depends on our power budget.  At 2500 watts the
problem is easy; at 2 watts the problem is hard.  As a reasonable
medium, let’s take 500 watts, which is 2 amps here in Argentina, less
than a toaster, hair dryer, or microwave oven, and about half a square
meter of sunlight.</p>
<p>With such a small kiln, we aren’t going to get a very good
approximation by pretending the thermal gradient is constant across
our insulating wall, but let’s do it anyway.</p>
<p>Our top and bottom walls are 2·π·(25mm)² ≈ 4000 mm²; our outer wall is
2π·25mm·60mm ≈ 9400 mm²; total is 13400 mm².  Our total thermal flux
is 500 W/(11400 mm²) ≈ 37 kW/m².  Over a difference of 640 kelvins,
that’s about 58 W/m²/K.  Expressing this as an insulation value
(R-value) instead, we have 0.017 m² K/W.  Loose-fill vermiculite is
17 m·K/W (according to <a href="../notes/regenerator-gas-kiln.html">Regenerator gas kiln</a>, though I don’t
know where it got that figure) so this requires about 1.2mm of
vermiculite.  Other insulators are in the ballpark.</p>
<p>So actually the constant-thermal-gradient approximation is going to be
pretty good.  I’d go with making it 10 mm or 20 mm of insulation
anyway, just in case, and maybe doubling the linear size of the kiln.</p>
<p>500 watts into 118 mℓ works out to a bit over 4 W/mℓ, which is
adequate for a few kelvins per second of temperature rise, if somehow
the whole microkiln is full of solid and yet thermally homogeneous.
Since that would reach full firing temperature in a few minutes, it
seems like a more than adequate specific power.</p>
<p>In the sunlight case, say you go with a solar concentration factor of,
say, 100, just to be safe, and you also go for a whole square meter,
to get a kilowatt.  Now you are faced with the problem that to squeeze
the whole square meter into the kiln aperture, which ideally faces
directly downwards, you must exceed this solar concentration factor;
the kiln aperture can’t be more than a 500th of a square meter at that
kiln size.  This is another reason to want to increase the size of the
kiln, and by more than a factor of 2.</p>
<p>So, revised design parameters: internal volume is a cylinder 150 mm
across and 100 mm tall.  Now we have 1.8 ℓ of volume, 0.018 m² of
surface area on the bottom to cut a sun hole in, and 0.059 m² of total
internal surface area to lose heat through by conduction.  We use 20mm
of insulating refractory for the walls and floor, which is kind of
crappy as insulators go, so maybe its insulation value is only
8 m·K/W; this works out to 0.37 W/K, which means that at 640 K of
inside-outside temperature difference we need 236 W of power input to
maintain temperature.  But we actually have 400 W of power, a
comfortable safety margin, which works out to 230 mW/mℓ, which would
heat water by about four kelvins a minute if the thing were full of
water, but in the more reasonable case where it contains like 200
grams of stuff, we get 40 kelvins a minute, which gets us to full
firing temperature (disregarding heat loss through the insulation!) in
15 minutes.</p>
<p>(Hmm, Henan Sinocean says <a href="http://www.firebrick-refractory.com/Products/Pro_285.html">their high-alumina insulating firebrick</a>
conducts 0.18 to 0.5 W/m/K, which I guess is insulating at 2 to 5.6
m·K/W, at a density of 0.3 g/cc for the best insulation up to 1 g/cc
for the worst.  These numbers are very high for insulating substances,
barely better than ordinary bricks, but they are only a little worse
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_thermal_conductivities">the Sheffield Pottery insulating firebrick numbers in
Wikipedia</a> and the <a href="http://www.bryantrefractory.com/uploads/products/20_9.pdf">BNZ Materials insulating firebrick
brochure</a>, and I probably can’t do better, though I might do worse.
So I might need 40mm of insulation instead of 20mm.)</p>
<p>400 watts of sunlight is 0.4 m²; a solar concentration factor of 100
(theoretically capable of reaching 900°) then requires a hole of
0.004 m², which is nearly a quarter of the floor area, which is still
probably okay.  A solar concentration factor of 100 could also be
thought of, in imaging optics, as 10× magnification, or, in antenna
design, as 20dBi.  Both of these are eminently achievable.  You could
even reach that level with a trough reflector, though it wouldn’t be
the easiest way.</p>

<p><a href="http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-622365277-kanthal-alambre-para-resistencias-020-030-040-050-_JM">Ten meters of Kanthal costs AR$70</a>, whether it’s 0.2 mm, 0.3, 0.4,
or 0.5, and it’s good to 1250° — not ideal for a pottery kiln, but it
would do.  It’s not clear which Kanthal this is; there are various
grades of Kanthal; <a href="http://www.kanthal.com/en/products/material-datasheets/wire/resistance-heating-wire-and-resistance-wire/kanthal-af/">one is Kanthal AF</a>, which is good to 1300° and
has a resistivity of 1.39 Ω mm²/m, but doesn’t come in such narrow
gauges.</p>
<p>How do I figure out how much wire I need?  In theory you can get an
arbitrarily large amount of power out of a fixed voltage source by
putting an arbitrarily small resistance across it, since P = E²/R.
However, in this case the crucial fact is not really the resistivity
of the wire — as I thought it was — but its surface area!  It needs
enough surface area to emit the desired amount of power at its safe
temperature — at these temperatures, almost entirely as radiant heat.</p>
<p>That’s why the Kanthal data page gives its fully-oxidized emissivity:
0.7.  So how much wire surface area do I need to emit 400 watts with
emissivity 0.7 at, say, 1100°?  0.7 σ T⁴ = 141kW/m², so I need
2800 mm² (0.0028 m²), about 5% of the total inner wall area of the
microkiln.</p>
<p>That’s somewhat alarming!  But, it turns out, not fatal.</p>
<p>Ten meters of 0.5 mm diameter Kanthal has almost 7900 mm² of surface
area, and so thus, emitting at 1100°, it emits 1108 watts; at 1200°,
it emits 1470 W.  So really four meters of it (AR$28) should be
adequate.  (I’m a little skeptical that the price is actually correct,
since all the other prices seem to be much higher.)</p>
<p>(Is it bad that I’m ignoring the radiant heat absorbed by the wire?  I
think it’s okay, since it’s hypothetically so much hotter than
everything else.)</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> the engineering question of making the resistance low
enough to get enough power out, without making it so low you draw too
much power.  In this case we want about 2 amps at 220 volts, which
requires 110Ω.  Four meters of 0.5 mm wire should be about
10 · 1.39 Ω / (π (¼mm)²), which is close — it’s 28 ohms.  The easy
thing to do is just go ahead and use a longer wire: at 7Ω/m, you need
15.5 meters.  Or a narrower one: ten meters of the 0.4 mm wire should
be just right, and has 12566 mm² of surface area.</p>
<p>At 150 mm diameter, that’s about 20 turns of a spiral around, which
puts the turns about 5 mm apart up the walls if I don’t coil them.  Or
I could coil them and use, say, four turns.</p>
<p>The volume of refractory is, say, the difference between a 230mm
diameter, 180mm height cylinder, and the 150mm diameter, 100 mm
cylinder space within: 7478 mℓ - 1767 mℓ = 5711 mℓ.  If we take a
middle-of-the-road figure of 0.7 g/cc for the refractory, it’s 4 kg of
clay.</p>
<p>To control the temperature, we need a thermocouple, probably AR$200,
probably type K.</p>
<p>What would this microkiln design look like if I wanted to include
safety margins to ensure that it would heat up and wouldn’t burn out?
After all, many unexpected things will no doubt occur — perhaps the
brick walls will leak, the Kanthal may be a counterfeit that burns out
at 1100° or has the wrong resistivity, the bricks may conduct more
than expected, and so forth.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what I would do to give it a <em>temperature</em> safety margin
so that it wouldn't burn up if it hit 1400°, which is a temperature
I’m extremely interested in.  Except to make it purely solar, I guess,
or arc-driven.
The issue is the maximum service temperature of the wire.  Kanthal A-1
is supposedly good to 1400°, and Kanthal APM is supposedly good to
1425°.  <a href="http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-624923350-kanthal-a1-26-awg-importado-lo-mejor-setups-usa--_JM">Kanthal A-1 is available on MercadoLibre, but at a 15× higher
