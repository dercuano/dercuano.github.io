(2 minutes)</div><p>I thought it would be fun to hand-draw a font on paper and scan the
paper, but producing a TrueType font from this in the usual way then
requires a certain amount of manual work, converting it to Béziers and
whatnot.  But, in a sense, you don’t really need all that manual work;
the input is pixels, and the output is also pixels, and the output is
a sort of pasteup of the input.</p>
<p>Minimally you do need some way to identify the location and
orientation and size of each character in the font on the page, which
is best done with some kind of interactive UI.  And you might want to
separately indicate the character cell and the bounds of the drawn
character — either because, in your drawing, some descender or
something impinged upon the character cell undesirably, or because you
have some kind of swash protruding.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the UX details of such an interface for now, there’s the
question of how to do the compositing of the different characters to
produce the rendered image.  Assuming you’re drawing on white paper,
you’d like to threshold the background paper to pure white, and treat
that as transparent.  So if you have overlapping bits of letterforms,
you’d like to composite them in something like logical-AND fashion:</p>
<pre><code>| A | B | A &amp; B |
| 0 | 0 |     0 |
| 0 | 1 |     0 |
| 1 | 0 |     0 |
| 1 | 1 |     1 |
</code></pre>
<p>Now, it might be a reasonable thing to do to actually do this in
binary, using oversampling.  (Maybe you do 2× oversampling in both X
and Y, so that each 32-bit word represents the top or bottom half of
16 different pixels; once you’re done with compositing using &amp;, you
can use parallel population-count on the subpixels to decide on the
grayscale value.  The apparent efficiencies of this approach, with an
average of 8 antialiased pixels per word instead of 1 or 4, are
somewhat compromised by the amount of bit-shifting required.)
Alternatively, though, you could use grayscale or even RGB
representations directly.  And in that case, clearly the compositing
operation you want is pointwise <em>multiplication</em> followed by rescaling
the result.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
