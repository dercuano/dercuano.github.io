(1 minute)</div><p>In Dan Bernstein's grant proposal to the NSF from 2001,
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/papers/nfscircuit.pdf">Circuits for Integer Factorization:
A proposal</a>,
he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A philosophical note</strong>.  I always thought that common
general-purpose computers were the pinnacle of realistic computational
power.  Special-purpose computer architectures, such as Lehmer's
bicycle chain sieve or Pomerance's Cracker or Shamir's TWINKLE, were
at best a constant factor faster.  Quantum computers are
asymptotically faster for many computations, but it is unclear whether
they can actually be built.</p>
<p>I also thought that parallel computing reduced the <em>time</em>, not the
<em>cost</em>, of computations.  Ten processors might perform a computation
in one tenth the time of a single processor, but they are ten times as
expensive, so the cost of the conmputation remains the same.</p>
<p>I was wrong.  Schimmler's machine, with m² processors, can be built
for m^{2+o(1)} dollars, just like a single-processor computer with
m^{2+o(1)} bits of memory.  It can sort m² numbers in time m^{1+o(1)},
while the single-processor machine needs time m^{2+o(1)}.  The cost of
the computation has dropped from m^{4+o(1)} to m^{3+o(1)}.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a hard time believing this,
but Bernstein is pretty reliable;
maybe I should go back 
and read more about Schimmler's machine.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
