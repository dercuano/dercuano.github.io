<hr />
<p>In the spirit of Hamming’s admonition to look for attacks on the most
important problems in your field, I propose a project.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about a kind of Unixy system for distributed,
high-performance, fault-tolerant, incremental, reproducible computing,
scalable to exabyte datasets.  It consists of a transactional
deterministic virtual machine, a content-addressed blob store, and a
cache management system.</p>
<p>Tentatively I’ve been calling it Kogluktualuk.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to generalize build systems like the NixOS build
system or apenwarr/Bernstein <code>redo</code> to use them for general-purpose
computing; given some kind of specification of a deterministic
computation that includes all of its input data, you can re-execute
the transaction later on and get bit-identical results, as long as you
either have stored or can recompute all of that input data.</p>
<p>(I say “transaction”, despite the false implication that there is an
underlying mutable data store being mutated by the transactions.
Kogluktualuk transactions do not mutate state, and they do not have
any access to mutable state; they merely generate output from input.)</p>
<p>For example, if “5B2uheZVEd5u61Nc5” is the secure hash of some
specification of a deterministic transaction — maybe a command line
like</p>
<pre><code>in_namespace "4dkcSzVpvmtcgCcUo" do /bin/sort /data/july-trades
</code></pre>
<p>then perhaps execute("5B2uheZVEd5u61Nc5") will produce an output
dataset with the hash “5GWFsognLrfv9tqin”; and if so, then it will
<em>always</em> produce “5GWFsognLrfv9tqin”, and never some other output
dataset.</p>
<p>If each blob of input data is specified either by a secure hash, or by
a secure hash of a script (and input data) that tells how to compute
it, you can be sure that it will be bit-identical if you re-execute
the transaction, and so the output data can be cached.  This means
that if the same computed data is required twice, it can be
opportunistically cached, and it’s safe to store the cache on
inexpensive, unreliable storage; and it is possible to detect and
correct incorrect transactions by reproducing the transaction, for
example on a different machine.</p>
<p>Running a transaction that has more than one input blob that is
identified by the transaction to produce it (rather than directly by
its content hash) offers opportunities for deterministic concurrency
and distribution.</p>
<p>For example, in the above transaction, perhaps the namespace
“4dkcSzVpvmtcgCcUo” includes input specifications something like the
following:</p>
<pre><code>/data/july-trades blob 3yCXJMme1nn3mthVP
/bin/sort         do /bin/ejs /src/sort.js
/bin/ejs          do /bin/jsinterp /src/ejs.js /src/ejs.js
/bin/jsinterp     do /bin/cc /src/jsinterp.c
/bin/cc           do /bin/slowcc /src/cc.c
/bin/slowcc       do /bin/as /src/slowcc.s
/bin/as           blob 2r3g5UzEREHrbCyeg
</code></pre>
<p>This allows the fetching of <code>/data/july-trades</code> from a remote blob
store to happen in parallel with, if necessary, the recompilation of
/bin/sort.  Normally, of course, there will be a cached version of
/bin/sort; it won’t be necessary to bootstrap the entire universe from
source code to sort a data blob.</p>
<p>Also, though, if /data/july-trades is large, /bin/sort can split it
into a number of smaller blobs, then map a name to the sorted version
of each smaller blob:</p>
<pre><code>/tmp/xaa.sorted  do /bin/sort /tmp/xaa
/tmp/xab.sorted  do /bin/sort /tmp/xab
/tmp/xac.sorted  do /bin/sort /tmp/xac
</code></pre>
<p>Then, it can merge those sorted chunk blobs to generate its output
blob.  These separate sorting operations can run in parallel, and
potentially on different machines, in isolated namespaces of their
own; this introduces no nondeterminism into the computation of the
transaction, because accessing the sorted smaller blob invisibly
blocks until it is complete.  (Or, at least, enough of it is available
to satisfy the read request.)</p>
<p>Once the transaction is complete, the entire modified namespace can
evaporate, leaving only a precipitated output blob.</p>
<p>It’s desirable both to generate the dependency graphs of the
computation dynamically, as in the above example, and to statically
audit that all necessary data for a transaction is present.  We can
obtain both of these properties at once with this filesystem-like
level of indirection; processes running inside of a computation are
not permitted to request arbitrary hashes — only those hashes
statically mapped into their filesystem namespace at startup.</p>
<p>The cache management system is responsible for deciding which
deterministically computed output blobs to retain in the
content-addressed blob store.  Doing this optimally is of course
impossible, but doing it adequately should be feasible, since it can
see the structure of the global transaction graph and how long each
transaction took.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>The grain size of the separate nodes in this computational graph can
be quite small before it starts to cost significant efficiency,
perhaps 128 kibibytes and a few million instructions, particularly
with efficient fork(), reasonably simple virtual memory mappings,
and/or compiler-enforced security.</p>
<p>The VM code (for example, the blob of /bin/sort) produced by the
various compilers can be AOT-compiled to native code for particular
platforms, and perhaps this can also be stored in the cache.  Under
some circumstances it might make sense to recompile this native code
with greater optimization over time.</p>
<h2>Incrementality</h2>
<p>I said that Kogluktualuk is “incremental”.  The way to get an
incremental recomputation is to generate a new namespace that shares
most of its mappings with an existing namespace, and then run a
transaction in the new namespace that has previously run in the old
namespace; if the computation decomposes into many subtransactions as
suggested above, then only the subtransactions whose input data has
changed will need to be rerun.</p>
<p>In the case of the sort example above, unfortunately, that includes
the entire merge phase, a problem which could be reduced by passing a
partitioning of the keyspace to the smaller-blob-sorting
subtransactions, which could then produce as output not a single blob
but a large number of blobs, one for each partition of the keyspace.
Then you could split the merge phase into many independent merge
transactions, perhaps only some of which would need to be rerun.</p>
<h2>Dynamic dependency information</h2>
<p>Getting this kind of incrementality conveniently requires extracting
dynamic dependency information from the transactions as they run, like
the Vesta SCM, Composable Memory Transactions, a serializable SQL
transaction, or <code>redo</code>; the static dependency information is
potentially very imprecise.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps the sort transaction above didn’t happen to
access /bin/grep, even though perhaps it is mapped; it would be useful
if that allowed us to keep using the cached output of the sort
transaction, even in a new namespace with a new mapping for /bin/grep.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the independent-merge-phase example above, it would be
convenient if we could use the dynamic behavior of the merge phase to
determine which partitions each merge transaction depended on.
Perhaps this one:</p>
<pre><code>/output/sorted.ZION-ZNGA  do /bin/merge /tmp/*.sorted.ZION-ZNGA
</code></pre>
<p>didn’t happen to access /tmp/xac.sorted.XOOM-Z, even though it was
mapped into its namespace; therefore a re-execution with a different
/tmp/xax.sorted.XOOM-Z shouldn’t have to re-execute the merge.</p>
<p>At this point, we have reproduced the sort-by-MapReduce from the
original MapReduce paper.</p>
<h2>How far can this approach go?  Can you run your windowing system in it?</h2>
<p>It might be feasible to use this approach even down to the level of
handling mouse events; maybe moving the mouse generates a new
namespace which differs in that /dev/mouse now says “228,301\n”
instead of “205,301\n”, and the resulting incremental recomputation is
capable of reusing almost all of the previous computation of the
screen image to display, writing an /output/framebuffer with the new
screen contents, which might be identical except for a mouse pointer
and some mouseover highlight colors.</p>
<p>(You might want to write an /output/uistate that becomes the
/input/uistate for the next UI transaction, too, and you might want to
spawn the framebuffer update off in a subtransaction in case it isn’t
needed.)</p>
<p>I’m not sure taking it this far is a good idea, for a couple of
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It seems important to be able to guarantee responsivity for the user
  interface.  This seems incompatible with depending entirely on
  nondeterministic caching for performance; if you decided to update
  /src/cc.c with a better-optimizing version, it would be unpleasant
  to have your next display frame delay three hours while the entire
  system was potentially recompiled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems important to be able to display the state of transactions
  in progress in the user interface, which seems sort of incompatible
  with the strong guarantee of determinism.  But maybe the
  relationship between the user interface transaction and other
  transactions can be special.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems like the user interface is a place where you need to be
  able to put in new hashes in order to fetch them from the cache, but
  we previously said that’s a thing transactions can’t do, because it
  could allow them to depend on data that isn’t statically mapped into
  their namespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it seems like if you could make it work, you could get
transparent persistence and migratability of your desktop environment,
plus the ability to roll back to previous checkpoints.  You only need
to make sure that all of your mouse movements and keystrokes and
whatever other events can affect your UI (completion of other
transactions, maybe, or the passage of time) are safely recorded,
either that or /input/uistate.  Every point in time in your user
interface has a hash, with which you can retrieve it and then explore
other execution paths.</p>
<h2>Overall significance</h2>
<p>Kogluktualuk is a major advance in computing systems in terms of
efficiency, simplicity, scientific reproducibility, digital
preservation, practical software freedom, practical parallel
computation, and security.</p>
<p>Reproducibility is a crucial requirement for scientific work, and
digital preservation is a crucial requirement for historical work.  It
is often infeasible to determine what factors a computational result
depends on.  Kogluktualuk computations are reproducible forever, as
long as their source data is preserved, and it automatically
determines what that data is, so that you can preserve it.</p>
<p>For free software to be more than a theoretical construct, it needs to
be possible in practice to recompile the software we are using.  This
is often unnecessarily difficult in current practice.  Kogluktualuk,
like Nix, automates this, so that you are guaranteed to be able to
recompile anything you can run, except for a tiny bootstrap stub.</p>
<p>It is often difficult in practice to take advantage of the available
parallel computational resources, for reasons including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>heterogeneity,</li>
<li>host exposure to attacks by untrusted code,</li>
<li>private data exposure to untrusted hosts,</li>
<li>exposure to untrusted hosts introducing malicious data,</li>
<li>the increasing likelihood of hardware faults as scale increases,</li>
<li>the excessive performance overhead of systems like Hadoop, and</li>
<li>awkward programming interfaces and user interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kogluktualuk improves the situation as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>paper over heterogeneity with a uniform virtual machine at an
  acceptable performance cost,</li>
<li>isolate untrusted code within sandboxes so it can’t attack the host,</li>
<li>have (I hope) very low performance overhead,</li>
<li>automatically detect and recover some some kinds of hardware faults,
  and be configurable to detect and recover from all hardware faults,
  at a heavy performance cost,</li>
<li>have the possibility of detecting and defeating malicious data
  introduction attacks, and</li>
<li>have (I hope) convenient interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it does not protect against the disclosure of private data to
untrusted hosts.</p>
<p>Occasionally free-software communities have been exposed to
trojaned-binary attacks, including from SourceForge, in which the
compiled binary has malicious code inserted into it that is not
present in the source code.  The most extreme form of this attack,
demonstrated by Ken Thompson and previously hypothesized during the
Multics security audit, involves inserting self-reproducing backdoor
code into the compiler binary, so that even recompiling the compiler
from source will not solve the problem.  Currently, if any Debian
Developer’s development machine is compromised, the attacker can
nearly undetectably compromise binaries built on that machine by
inserting malicious code into them, and they will later be distributed
to all Debian users who install that package.</p>
<p>The defense against these binary-poisoning attacks is reproducible
builds, pioneered by the Tor project and now widely adopted, including
by nearly all Debian packages.  Kogluktualuk makes all builds
reproducible, and it can be used to automatically detect such attacks.</p>
<p>In most existing computing systems, all computations have full access
to read and write every file accessible by the user that launches
them, as well as sending that data over the internet and manipulating
and measuring the CPU load in order to communicate data through covert
channels.  In Kogluktualuk, each computation only has access to the
data it is explicitly provided, and almost no computations have access
to the clock or to the ability to pause themselves at will.  This
dramatically reduces users’ vulnerability to malicious code.</p>
<p>Incrementalization of computation can often provide enormous
performance increases, often three or more orders of magnitude; in the
form of <code>make</code>, this was crucial, for example, to enabling the
original development of UNIX in a high-level language on shared
0.4-MIPS computers in the 1970s.  Current work in automatic
incrementalization, under the name “self-adjusting computation”, is
producing very promising results, but involves a slowdown of a factor
of about five when the computation does not benefit from
incrementality.  Kogluktualuk should provide most of the performance
benefit of full incrementality with no detectable overhead in the
non-incremental case.</p>
<p>I’ve written before about the inefficiencies and bugs due to the
numerous ad-hoc levels of caching in our existing computer systems.
Kogluktualuk’s unified caching system obviates every level of caching
of greater granularity than a few million instructions, and it has the
necessary global information to optimize caching globally.  Even
without any incrementality or parallelization benefit, this should
produce better-performing computer systems, and they should be much
simpler.</p>
<h2>Unresolved questions</h2>
<p>What does the user interface look like?</p>
<p>How do we index the computation cache so that it depends only on the
dynamic dependencies of a computation, yet is fast to retrieve from?
Maybe it would be better to spawn subtransactions in a very restricted
namespace with only the things they depend on, even if that requires
duplicating the information of which things they depend on in their
caller?</p>
<p>What should the virtual machine look like?  In particular, how should
it handle floating-point math, and should it be vector-oriented in
order to get better performance from available GPU (SIMT) and SIMD
(e.g. SSE) resources?</p>
<p>How low can we get the overhead of forking off a subtransaction?  Am I
being too optimistic to think that 128 kiB and a few million
instructions is big enough to amortize that overhead into
insignificance?  Or am I even being pessimistic?  Does it depend on
whether the subtransaction is going to get run on a different cluster
node?</p>
<p>What about data that can potentially be computed in more than one way,
depending on what data is available in cache?  For example, in an OLAP
system, you might want to see total sales by region (4 rows); if you
have an existing materialized view of total sales by region and
product category (40 rows) or total sales by region and customer type
(16 rows), you can calculate the desired result very quickly, much
more quickly than if you have to trawl over the entire dataset of,
say, 50,000,000 rows.  But maybe you only have one of those two views
already computed, and it would be nice to use the one that is.  Is
there a way to fit this into the Kogluktualuk paradigm?</p>
<p>Guaranteeing responsiveness probably requires updating some cached
items preemptively, rather than waiting for them to be needed.</p>
<p>What’s the story on publicly-accessible caches?  If you choose to
trust a publicly-accessible binary cache for your Nix packages, you
can avoid having to recompile anything yourself.  But with
Kogluktualuk, you might be at risk not only of getting malicious code
from that cache, but also of sending that cache the hashes of private
data in order to find out whether they are present there.  You could
reduce this risk with something like Bloom filters or compressed
Golomb rulers; is that enough, and if not, how can this risk be
eliminated or made acceptable?</p>
<p>Anytime algorithms, which can be stopped at any point when time is
running out, are important for real-time computation, for example in
robotics and in some user interfaces, because they can guarantee
real-time responsiveness without the heavy restrictions that are
needed to deterministically bound the halting time of an algorithm.
Many mathematical optimization metaheuristics automatically produce
anytime algorithms.  Can they be fit into Kogluktualuk’s framework?</p>
<p>Truly random numbers are important for security.  Enormously many
secret keys have been compromised by compromised sources of
randomness, including the Debian OpenSSL debacle and the Dual EC DRBG
backdoor.  One of the problems introduced by transparent
checkpoint-and-restart systems like those in VirtualBox is that they
can result in reuse of randomness, which can compromise that
randomness.  (One-time pads and DSA have notoriously bad problems
here, but RSA keys with common moduli, for example, have also been
broken en masse.)  Kogluktualuk seems to allow checkpoint-and-restart
functionality without this problem, because the granularity of the
checkpoint is transactional, and you can probably avoid allowing the
truly random data to escape a transaction.  Does that really work?</p>
<p>What about resources like RAM?  What do you do if a transaction wants
to allocate ten gigabytes of RAM?  Could that provide a covert
signaling channel for exfiltrating private information to other
transactions?  Is there a way to ensure that some (or most?)
transactions are small and light enough to run on small embedded
processors?</p>
<p>Is there a way to get out of writing a compiler for a virtual machine
instruction set, at least for prototyping Kogluktualuk?</p>
<p>Should we store everything in the same blob store — non-derived and
thus irreplaceable source data, transaction outputs, native code for a
particular processor, the cache database?  Relatedly, how does
Kogluktualuk relate to version control with Git?</p>
<p>In the cluster case, is the blob store implemented as a DHT, or what?</p>
<p>What interface does a transaction use to tell Kogluktualuk what its
outputs are?</p>
<p>Is it really practical to do pipelining by having a pipeline of
transactions that each read from the previous transaction’s output,
without having each one pause until the previous one is done?  Is
there a way we can usually avoid storing the data that flowed through
the pipeline?</p>
<p>How do we modularize namespaces so that we can make a new namespace
that differs from an existing one by changing one file (like
/dev/mouse or /src/grep.c), without generating many megabytes of data
traffic?</p>
<p>What exactly are the algorithms the cache service uses to figure out
what to evict from cache?</p>
<p>In a cluster implementation of Kogluktualuk, how do we decide which
transactions to run on which nodes?  Does the hierarchical transaction
structure provide enough information about the communication patterns
to do a good job of this?  If large blobs (like my example
/data/july-trades above) are sharded across nodes, how much of that do
we expose to the transactions running on top in order to allow them to
optimally divide up their subtransactions, and how do those
subtransactions end up on the best node — do we migrate or restart
them on a new node if they start accessing large data blocks, or what?</p>
<p>How do we deal with laggard nodes in a cluster implementation?</p>
<p>How do you fit reactive computation into this framework, if at
all — how do you do, for example, a chat system?  (Is there anything
interesting in Urbit’s implementation of chat?)</p>
<p>For things like what people use SPARK for, can we get adequate
performance with, say, binary floating-point data in one column per
file?  (Kogluktualuk is a lot like SPARK.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
