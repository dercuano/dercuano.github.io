<p>XXX tone down the arrogant pedant attitude</p>
<p>(Edited and considerably expanded from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20906267">my comments on the orange
website</a>.)</p>
<p>What does it mean for something to be a “programming language”?
It might seem like a trivial discussion of semantics, but as it turns out,
it’s important to care for semantics in order to have a conversation
that conveys information, which is necessary for having culture.</p>
<p>Moreover, the real question here is not one of word definitions, but
one of ontology: what kinds of categories exist in the real world?  If
we attempt to reason with incoherent categories, such as “non-elephant
mammals plus mosquitoes”, we cripple our reasoning.  Reasoning with
such categories, we are likely to believe that mosquitoes probably
bear live young and produce milk, even if we haven’t been able to
observe these phenomena yet, and be unable to use observations of
elephants to reject false hypotheses about mammals.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, after thousands of years of effort, the humans
finally succeeded in formalizing the notion of an <em>logical procedure</em>
or <em>algorithm</em> in the construct of a <em>computer program</em>, and the
implications of this discovery touch on some of the most profound
questions about the limits of the knowable, the foundations of
mathematics, and even the nature of the physical universe; and
subsequent experiments rapidly disproved many long-held philosophical
notions about the nature of human thought.  The concept of a
<em>programming language</em> is emerging as fundamental to this far-reaching
intellectual breakthrough.</p>
<p>Dismayingly, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-top-programming-languages-2019">a recent article in IEEE Spectrum</a>
incorrectly described HTML as a
programming language, so it seems to me important to clear up the
confusion.</p>
<h2>Popular confusion about programming languages</h2>
<p>One person eloquently defended the popular confusion as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People don’t care for semantics. If you write it and it causes a PC
to do something (even if it’s just to show a website), it’s a
programming language. Doesn’t need to have branching, variables,
etc... (not to mention that HTML includes JS and CSS) <code>print "hello
world"</code>, <code>&lt;b&gt;hello world&lt;/b&gt;</code>, same difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to amount to the position “my ignorance is as good as your
knowledge”.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this proposed definition of programming languages
includes CSV, JPEG, Word, and URLs.  Does that mean that
anyone who snaps a photo on Instagram is a programmer?  This does not
seem to be in accordance with the usual meaning of the word
“programmer”.  Is it “programming” to write a dunning letter in Word?
It seems to me like a qualitatively different activity.</p>
<p>Upon being presented with this argument, the misguided-egalitarian
admirer of foolishness responded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet people don’t call them “programming languages”, while they
do call HTML that — so that even if HTML is not a programming
language, there’s still a not formally expressed difference that
people can intuitively grasp with those other things...</p>
<p>You can’t program most things in SQL either (not without some modern
extensions that make it Turing complete), but it is still considered
a programming language...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is it that really distinguishes an ontologically coherent
category of “programming languages” from other things, and why are the
ignorant so frequently confused into thinking HTML is a programming
language?  What is this “not formally expressed difference” that
“people can intuitively grasp”?  And how much <em>can</em> you program in
SQL, anyway?</p>
<h2>The deep essence of programming languages</h2>
<p><em>Programming languages</em> are all more or less equivalent; although they
have a variety of paradigms, and although they are supplied with a
variety of I/O facilities, you can program more or less precisely the
same set of <em>computations</em> in all of them.  This is called
“Turing-completeness”.</p>
<p>Consider the differences between C, Forth, Smalltalk, Prolog,
Fractran, Lisp, Brainfuck, Haskell, VHDL, amd64 machine code,
Malbolge, Scratch, Octave, Python, and R:
some of these do not even have branching or loops or variables, but
they are all programming languages; none of them can compute anything
that any of the others cannot.</p>
<p>The exception might be things like Turner’s “Total Functional
Programming”, which excludes nonterminating computations without, he
hopes, excluding much of practical interest; Excel, excluding the
macro language, also has this limitation, but in Excel it is more
onerous.</p>
<p>By contrast, you can’t compute so much as a polynomial or NAND in
HTML. That is to say, you can’t program at all in HTML. So HTML is not
a programming language.  The same is true of CSV, JPEG, URLs, and Word
documents (except insofar as Word documents might include macros).</p>
<p>You might say that HTML includes JS, but this is wrong.
English does not include Latin, although, e.g.†, phrases like “<em>inter
alia</em>” and “<em>et cetera</em>” can be used in English, and it’s not uncommon
for an English sentence to quote a Latin motto. Similarly, HTML does
not include JS and CSS, just as it does not include the URL
syntax, and Python does not include SQL or HTML; they are six
separate languages.</p>
<p>† <em>exempli gratia</em></p>
<h3>An example of a borderline case: tabulating polynomials in SQL</h3>
<p>It’s fairly uncommon for people to call SQL
a “programming language”, but you actually can program quite a bit
with SQL; even without the recursive common table expressions alluded to
above by the promoter of vulgar misconceptions,
you can do surprisingly complex computations with it, and
even define functions in the form of views, as long as they are
finite. Certainly neither NAND nor evaluating polynomials poses any
difficulty for SQL. In fact, here’s an example of <em>arbitrary</em>
polynomial evaluation in SQL which works in MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres,
Oracle, and SQL Server:</p>
<pre><code>select x, sum(a * power(x, e)) from data group by x;
</code></pre>
<p>In SQLite, you easily can evaluate a <em>particular</em> polynomial, or,
with a bit more hassle, any polynomial up to some finite degree, but
evaluating an <em>arbitrary</em> polynomial would seem to be out of reach
without using recursive CTEs.  Here’s an example of how to do this
for polynomials up to the fourth degree without recursive CTEs:</p>
<pre><code>select x, sum(a * case e when 4 then x*x*x*x
                         when 3 then x*x*x
                         when 2 then x*x
                         when 1 then x
                         when 0 then 1 end) from data group by x;
</code></pre>
<p>The identifier <code>data</code> provides the polynomial to evaluate and the
points at which to evaluate it; this can be a table or, in most
dialects of SQL, provided directly inline.  In SQLite, for example, in
this case evaluating 5<em>x</em>⁴ + 2<em>x</em> + 5 at the points 0, 1, 2, and 3:</p>
<pre><code>select x, sum(a * case e when 4 then x*x*x*x
                         when 3 then x*x*x
                         when 2 then x*x
                         when 1 then x
                         when 0 then 1 end)
from (select 3 as x union select 0 union select 1 union select 2) xt,
     (select 4 as e, 5 as a union
      select 0, 5 union
      select 1, 2) t
group by x;
</code></pre>
<p>This syntax works in other database engines, but in, for example,
Postgres, you can instead simply say</p>
<pre><code>select x, sum(a * power(x, e))
from (select 3 as x union values (0), (1), (2)) xt,
     (select 4 as e, 5 as a union values (0, 5), (1, 2)) t
group by x;
</code></pre>
<p>MySQL (5.5.62, at least) has <code>power</code> but requires the more verbose
literal data syntax:</p>
<pre><code>select x, sum(a * power(x, e))
from (select 3 as x union select 0 union select 1 union select 2) xt,
     (select 4 as e, 5 as a union
      select 0, 5 union
      select 1, 2) t
group by x;
</code></pre>
<p>Note, though, that even the Postgres version of this is somewhat
repetitive; to evaluate the polynomial at 100 points, we would have to
put 100 numbers and 192 more words into the source code.  While this
is not as bad as HTML, where we would have to evaluate the polynomial
ahead of time (for example, with pencil and paper, or with SQL, or
with an actual programming language) it still means that there are
things that are easier to program in languages such as Fractran or
Malbolge than in SQL — without recursive CTEs, that is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With</em> recursive CTEs, you can do it compactly, though fairly
awkwardly, because recursive CTEs <em>do</em> make SQL Turing-complete:</p>
<pre><code>with recursive redonditos as (select 0 as x union
                              select x+1 from redonditos where x &lt; 99)
select x, sum(a * power(x, e))
from (select 4 as e, 5 as a union values (0, 5), (1, 2)) t, redonditos
group by x;
</code></pre>
<p>This works in Postgres (9.5.14) and, with the change explained
earlier, in SQLite 3.  MySQL doesn’t support CTEs, at least as of
5.5.62.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excel without macros, Coq, and GNU MathProg are other languages that
can compute large classes of interesting functions but are not
Turing-complete.</p>
<h3>What kinds of generalizations are valid about programming languages?</h3>
<p>The first and most important fact about programming languages is the
Turing Tarpit Principle: they are all equivalent, in the sense that
<em>any of them can compute any algorithm</em>, which is to say, anything any
of the others can compute; but that does not mean that it is equally
easy in all of them.  (“In the Turing Tarpit,” observes Fred Brooks,
all computable functions are “possible, but nothing of interest is
easy.”  “Turing Tarpit” languages like Malbolge perversely elevate
this to a design goal, and so it took several years for someone to
figure out how to write a working loop in Malbolge.)</p>
<p>In particular, the Halting Problem applies to all of them: you cannot
always compute whether a program in them will continue to loop forever
on a given input, or whether it will eventually terminate.  Turing
gave an airtight but somewhat lengthy and mindbending proof of this in
1936.</p>
<h4>The Collatz conjecture in Python; does this program halt?</h4>
<p>But a very simple argument that shows that this is at least very
difficult is searching for counterexamples to the Collatz conjecture.
In Python:</p>
<pre><code>cn = lambda n: 3*n + 1 if n % 2 == 1 else n // 2
(x, n, m, p) = (1, 1, 1, 0)
while True:
    if m == 1 or cn(m) == 1:
        print("{} → 1 in {} steps".format(x, 2*p if m == 1 else 2*p+1))
        (x, n, m, p) = (x+1, x+1, x+1, 0)
    else:
        (n, m, p) = (cn(n), cn(cn(m)), p+1)
        if n == m:
            print("{} loops without reaching 1".format(x))
            exit()
</code></pre>
<p>This produces lines such as the following:</p>
<pre><code>1 → 1 in 0 steps
2 → 1 in 1 steps
3 → 1 in 7 steps
4 → 1 in 2 steps
5 → 1 in 5 steps
6 → 1 in 8 steps
7 → 1 in 16 steps
8 → 1 in 3 steps
9 → 1 in 19 steps
10 → 1 in 6 steps
</code></pre>
<p>The Collatz conjecture says that this sequence, where the successor of
a number <em>n</em> is 3<em>n</em> + 1 for odd <em>n</em> and ½<em>n</em> for even <em>n</em>, reaches 1
if you start at any positive <em>n</em>.  Lothar Collatz proposed this in
1937, but nobody has found a proof of it yet, nor a disproof.  If the
conjecture is true, then the program above will run forever,
continuously printing lines of text, if it isn’t halted externally.
If it is false because there exists a Collatz cycle that doesn’t
include 1, the program will halt by invoking <code>exit()</code>.  If it is false
because it finds a Collatz sequence that increases without bound, it
will instead run forever without printing anything, if it doesn’t run
out of memory first.</p>
<p>Nobody knows which of these three is the case, despite some 80 years
of effort from many of the most famous mathematicians and physicists;
at least one book has been published on the subject.  (It is entitled
<em>The Ultimate Challenge</em>.)  That is, 80 years of research by many
people has not been sufficient to predict the behavior of the 11 lines
of code above.  And you can translate that code into <em>any programming
language</em>.  (However, it is known that if there is a counterexample to
the Collatz conjecture, it is larger than 87 × 2⁶⁰, so your
translation may involve multiple-precision arithmetic and therefore be
several pages of code.  Python has arbitrary-precision arithmetic
built in.)</p>
<h4>The Collatz conjecture in non-Turing-complete languages</h4>
<p>You cannot translate it into CSV, JPEG, HTML, URLs, Excel without
macros, SQL without recursive CTEs, Coq, MathProg, or Turner’s Total
Functional Programming.  However, you can translate <em>the computation
within the loop</em> into most of these, at least with numbers limited to
some finite size (such as 128 bits or 256 bits); that is, you can
translate this part:</p>
<pre><code>cn = lambda n: 3*n + 1 if n % 2 == 1 else n // 2
if m == 1 or cn(m) == 1:
    print("{} → 1 in {} steps".format(x, 2*p if m == 1 else 2*p+1))
    (x, n, m, p) = (x+1, x+1, x+1, 0)
else:
    (n, m, p) = (cn(n), cn(cn(m)), p+1)
    if n == m:
        print("{} loops without reaching 1".format(x))
        exit()
</code></pre>
<p>For example, here is a fairly horrific but apparently correct†
translation into SQL (without recursive CTEs), tested in SQLite3 and
Postgres:</p>
<pre><code>select case when nextx then x + 1 else x end as x,
       case when nextx then x + 1
            else (case n % 2 when 1 then 3*n + 1
                                    else n / 2 end)
       end as n,
       case when nextx then x + 1
            else (case newm % 2 when 1 then 3*newm + 1
                                       else newm / 2 end)
       end as m,
       case when nextx then 0 else p+1 end as p,
       case when nextx then 0=1 else n = newm end as exit
from (select (m = 1 or newm = 1) as nextx, x, n, m, p, newm
      from (select x, n, m, p,
            case m % 2 when 1 then 3*m + 1
                              else m / 2 end as newm
            from (select 16 as x, 4 as n, 1 as m, 2 as p) state) a) b;
</code></pre>
<p>From there it is a matter of finding some external way to initialize
the computation and repeat it until it results in your translation of
<code>exit()</code>.  (And, as Turing argued, this is a generalized property of
all programs, not just this Collatz program — as long as you have
infinite memory, any of them can be rendered into an even more limited
form where each execution step is just a lookup in a finite table of
next actions.)</p>
<p>However, even in this limited form, you cannot translate the Collatz
program into HTML, CSV, JPEG, or an URL.  So, in that way, things like
Excel without macros and SQL without recursive CTEs are still
<em>programming languages</em>, even though they aren’t Turing-complete,
while things like HTML are not.</p>
<p>† Implementing multiple-precision arithmetic in SQL is left as an
exercise to the reader.  Maybe you can use <code>DECIMAL</code> — in Postgres,
<code>select power(2::decimal(30), 64) - (power(2::decimal(30), 64) - 1)</code>
works correctly, but that syntax is a Postgres extension to SQL.</p>
<h4>The Collatz program in SQL with recursive CTEs</h4>
<p>In Postgres 9.5.14 the query</p>
<pre><code>with recursive collatz as 
   (select 1 as x, 1 as n, 1 as m, 0 as p, 0=1 as exit union
    select case when nextx then x + 1 else x end as x,
           case when nextx then x + 1
                           else (case n % 2 when 1 then 3*n + 1
                                                   else n / 2 end)
           end as n,
           case when nextx then x + 1
                           else (case newm % 2 when 1 then 3*newm + 1
                                                      else newm / 2 end)
           end as m,
           case when nextx then 0 else p+1 end as p,
           case when nextx then 0 = 1 else n = newm end as exit
    from (select (m = 1 or newm = 1) as nextx, x, n, m, p, newm
          from (select x, n, m, p,
                case m % 2 when 1 then 3*m + 1 else m / 2 end as newm
                from collatz where not exit) a) b
    where x &lt; 100)
select * from collatz;
</code></pre>
<p>appears to work, producing 1634 rows in 23 ms.</p>
<p>In SQLite 3.11.0, subqueries cannot refer to recursive CTEs, and it's
not obvious to me how to reformulate this query to eliminate the
subqueries.</p>
<h4>Rice’s Theorem</h4>
<p>We could describe the above program as computing a partial function of
the integers, namely how many Collatz iterations it takes to reach 1 from each
integer.  It’s a <em>partial function</em> in that the program might fail to
produce an answer for a given input if that Collatz sequence increases
without bound.  Rice’s Theorem extends Turing’s proof of the Halting
Problem’s incomputability to say that there is no algorithm to prove
any nontrivial property of the partial function computed by given
Turing machines, and thus by given programs in any Turing-complete
programming language.  The definition of “nontrivial” is amazingly
wide.</p>
<h4>Computational complexity</h4>
<p>There is additionally an issue related to <em>computational complexity</em>:
in programming languages it is easy to write a program that will take
a very long time to run, even if it terminates.</p>
<h4>The conclusion: programming languages mean trouble</h4>
<p>This means that it is very easy to, in some sense, get ourselves in
trouble in any programming language — to produce a program intended to
do something in particular, but not be able to tell whether the
program does in fact always do that.  This leads to the
widely-remarked-on phenomenon of buggy software.</p>
<h3>Does this mean programmers are awesome and Web designers are not?</h3>
<p>No.  If we can extract any value judgment from this, it is rather the
opposite: it means that programmers are constantly tripping over their
own feet attempting to accomplish even seemingly-trivial tasks in
their programs.  This is the motivation behind the design of
non-Turing-complete languages like Coq, GNU MathProg, URLs, HTML,
Excel, and SQL (at least until recently): by steering clear of Rice’s
Theorem, we can ensure that our constructs behave in predictable ways,
can be analyzed in certain ways, and can be changed in predictable
ways.  In the history of the WWW, this was called the “Principle of
Least Power”; HTML was deliberately designed to not be a programming
language due to experience with using programming languages like
PostScript and T<sub>E</sub>X to represent documents.</p>
<p>In building any system, you should do as little as possible in
programming languages and as much as possible in passive data formats
like HTML.</p>
<p>The ongoing struggle to navigate between the Scylla of programming by
copy-pasting boilerplate and the Charybdis of Rice’s Theorem has given
rise to a fruitful and active area of research that continually
expands the set of borderline “programming language” cases; the SQL
example above shows one of the most successful cases.  However, HTML
is nowhere near that borderline.  It is a format for passive documents
consisting of marked-up text.</p>
<h2>Perhaps some of the ignorant confuse HTML with programming languages because it’s written in plain ASCII text</h2>
<p>I have occasionally heard people
saying HTML is a programming language. But they’re just
wrong. Presumably most people at some point thought the world was
flat; we shouldn’t attempt to explain away their error by saying that
they meant something different by “world” or “flat” than we do. Some
people think vaccines cause autism; this isn’t actually because
they’re using the word “vaccine” or “autism” in a different sense than
we are. They’re just wrong. (As for the people who think organic food
contains no chemicals, I’m not sure; I think some of them are just
wrong, while others are in fact just using a nonstandard definition of
“chemical”, meaning something like “pure chemical” or “industrially
produced chemical”.)</p>
<p>In the same way, people are just wrong if they think HTML belongs to
the set that includes C, Forth, Smalltalk, Prolog, Fractran, Lisp,
Brainfuck, Haskell, VHDL, amd64 machine code, Malbolge, Scratch,
Octave, Python, and R, rather than to the set that includes CSV, JPEG,
Word, and URLs. Similarly, bash clearly belongs to the former set, and
Excel (without macros) and SQL arguably do.</p>
<p>In a lot of cases, they seem to be reasoning based on shallow surface
features like the use of plain ASCII text files. (You can see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20906702">several
examples of this even in the original thread discussing the issue
on the orange website</a>.)  This is similar to
the neural network that learned to recognize photos of tanks based on
whether the photos had been taken on a sunny day or a cloudy day, or
the people who think I’m “hacking into systems” when they see me using
a terminal emulator — an understandable error from the ignorant and
foolish, but not one we should allow to confuse our own thinking.</p>
<p>After all, to an illiterate person, a page full of random letters and
spaces looks much the same as a page of a novel or a page from a legal
brief, and quite visibly different from, for example, a painting of
the Virgin Mary or a pornographic sculpture.  We would not therefore
assert that the legal brief is “fiction”, nor the page of random
letters “legalese”.  But an unlettered peasant might make such an
error, just as they might assert that the Earth is flat.</p>
<p>This, I think, is the “not formally expressed difference” that “people
can intuitively grasp”: if you don’t know how to read it, an editor
window full of HTML looks similar to an editor window full of JS, and
different from an editor window with a Microsoft Word document in it,
because the font has a fixed width and all the letters are the same
font size.  That’s what people intuitively grasp.</p>
<p>The surprise is to find that the editors of IEEE Spectrum have fallen
to such abysmal levels of ignorance.</p>
<h2>Is it bad to be ignorant?</h2>
<p>It is <em>unfortunate</em> to be ignorant, not <em>reproachable</em>.  Reproaching
someone for their ignorance is contemptible, like reproaching poor
people for their poverty or sick people for their sickness.  But to
<em>spread</em> ignorance is to impede others from escaping that unfortunate
situation, and that <em>is</em> reproachable.  It is malfeasance as surely as
robbery or deliberately infecting people with diseases.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/facepalm.html">Facepalm</a> (24 notes)
