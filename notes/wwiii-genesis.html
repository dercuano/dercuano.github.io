<li><a href="http://cluborlov.blogspot.com.ar/2014/10/putin-to-western-elites-play-time-is.html">in mid-2014 old Vlad said a third world war was imminent</a>
  because of the collapse of the institutions that had prevented it
  since 1945, and that precision-guided munitions were as dangerous as
  nuclear weapons;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/12006485/Pope-claims-Christmas-is-a-charade-due-to-continued-war-across-the-world.html">in late 2015 old Frank said that Christmas was a charade</a>
  because the world was at war and on a path to more war;</li>
<li>last week Daesh, who Russia is currently bombing in Syria and
  feuding with the US about, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/10/11/isis-used-an-armed-drone-to-kill-two-kurdish-fighters-and-wound-french-troops-report-says/">sent a mass-market precision-guided
  munition</a> against the peshmerga and, although it didn't work
  properly, it killed two of them anyway;</li>
<li>Turkey, a NATO member since 1952 and the one with the second largest
  military (and 90 nuclear weapons which theoretically belong to the
  US), is <a href="http://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-iraq-tensions/3545478.html">refusing to withdraw its troops from Iraqi territory</a>;
  today old Recep is insulted Iraq's prime minister, and he's
  demanding that the US deliver up old Fethullah because they say he
  was plotting the coup that was recently attempted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, not shown in these links, largely as a result of the ongoing war
in Syria and Iraq and its refugees, Turkey is suffering an
unprecedented crackdown on human rights, and Europe and the US are
experiencing levels of xenophobia unprecedented since the lead up to
WWII, resulting in a resurgent fascist movement, which incidentally
Russia blames for the most recent coup in Ukraine and used as
justification for reannexing Crimea, and which got their candidate
nominated as the US Republican Party's presidential candidate. And the
European Union is splitting apart. Also, two nuclear powers are
fighting in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>On top of all this, related to old Vlad's point about PGMs but not
fully explained in it, war tactics have changed so much since the last
war between great powers that it is inevitable that some great-power
militaries have doctrines that are likely to just get their people
slaughtered, as happened to the Iraqi army in the US invasions, or
more evocatively the futile bayonet charges in the Russo-Japanese war
and World War I. That means that nobody can predict what the outcome
of a possible conflict will be, which increases the chances that both
sides think they can win it.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/history.html">History</a> (71 notes)
