<blockquote>
<p>It's 2025. I want a bicycle to use to visit my friend Yésica in La
Plata, a city near Buenos Aires, where I live.  I type "recumbent
touring bicycle" into a model search engine and get a page full of
pictures of different models.  I click on one of them, a model
called the Matagallos, and adjust the parameters on the resulting
page: my inseam is 95 centimeters, I weigh 100 kilograms, I will be
carrying 50kg of luggage with me on the trip, I prefer dull brick
red to the default bright blue, and because I'm pretty strong and
not in a hurry for this trip, I prefer lower material cost to lower
weight.  My computer consults databases of parts available nearby to
fulfill the model's requirements; only 1.8mm spokes of dubious
metallurgical quality are conveniently in stock near where I live in
Argentina, so it ups the spoke count on the wheels from 36 to 48 to
compensate.</p>
<p>I review the model from different sides on my screen, using a
finite-element simulation to simulate how it will travel over bumps
and potholes, and find a problem: because this model was originally
developed for lighter riders, when the rider-weight parameter is set
all the way up to 100 kilograms, it happens to work out with an
unreasonably low ground clearance — I'll be bumping my ass on the
ground.  I call my friend Violeta for help, sending her a link to
the model.  She shows me how to adjust the formula for one of the
strut lengths to add a ground-clearance constraint, and then we test
the modified model to ensure that the results are reasonable across
the range of parameters.</p>
<p>Having validated her modification, I thank her and write up a couple
of sentences explaining the problem and the solution, and publish
the modification so that other people can try it out.  After making
a couple of cosmetic modifications (I want the struts all to look
like bones, and I don't want to display the model name, because the
police near here are nicknamed "gallos", and I don't want them to
feel threatened), I look at a list of prices and delivery times from
manufacturing services in my neighborhood.  I choose one that's 400
meters away and offers me US$102 with a delivery date of three hours
in the future.</p>
<p>I click the "submit" button, confirm the transaction on a handheld
smart card, and switch back to chatting with Violeta about the
vacation she's planning to take with her husband next month,
visiting Arecibo in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Three and a half hours later, my doorbell rings, and there's a truck
with my bicycle, assembled by robots from whatever materials and
parts happened to be on hand, using more or less traditional
processes of drawing, forging, cutting, drilling, lashing, gluing,
nailing, and welding.  By chance, a substantial part of this
particular bicycle is made of wood recovered from discarded pallets.
I key in the delivery PIN to get the truck to release the bicycle,
lift the bicycle off the truck, and press the "accept" button on the
truck, so that it can move on to its next stop.  Mine are the first
human hands that have touched it.</p>
<p>My ride to La Plata is uneventful — the full-body fairing keeps the
rain off me, and the speakers have amazing bass — and the bicycle
mostly performs well, but I notice a grinding noise coming from the
front wheel.  As I pedal, I search for "grinding noise matagallos
front wheel" in a search engine, and it turns out somebody else had
the same problem last year.  They figured out that the problem was
an over-tightened wheel bearing, and explain how to check, so I stop
to check.  Turns out my Matagallos got assembled with a cartridge
bearing, so it can't be tightened or loosened at all, but it seems
to have some kind of sand in it.  I do a search for "sand bearing"
and the number of the manufacturing service, and it turns out that
several other people using them have had the same problem, in
products as diverse as drills, fans, and food processors, although
I'm the only one to run into it with a bicycle.</p>
<p>Once I arrive in La Plata, I stop by a manufacturing service that
I'd contracted with on the way; they have a new front wheel ready
and waiting, and in a couple of minutes install it on the bicycle,
taking the defective wheel as partial payment of US$5.  Since I've
reported the bearing grit problem to the service near my house, they
accepted the blame and paid the remainder of the cost, US$3.  I
leave them a good review, explaining the problem and resolution, and
tag the other people who had reported grit problems so they'll see
it.</p>
<p>At Yésica's house, she and I pick a couple of interesting recipes
off a recipe blog, tone down the spiciness for her Argentine palate,
and submit it to the robot chef around the corner, paying it US$1
for the service.  Half an hour later, a bell rings to notify us that
the food is ready; we stroll around the corner to pick it up and
bring it back home.</p>
<p>Waking up in Yésica's bed in the morning, I'm pleasantly surprised
to find that my (Violeta's) improvement has been accepted into the
mainline Matagallos model, and I'm now listed as one of its
contributors.  The maintainer accepts my argument that the credit
belongs to her, not me, and replaces my name with hers.  I publish a
short experience report, describing the performance of the
Matagallos on the pothole-laden road from Buenos Aires to La Plata.</p>
<p>But now it's time for me to get to work.  A few blocks away, a
couple I don't know are seeking a mediator for an unspecified
marital conflict related to their autistic child, and as I happened
to be in town and with good reviews for similar mediations from some
of my friends, they requested that I meet with them.  I consult
their reputation — they seem to be trustworthy — so I accept their
proposal of a US$800 fee for an hour and bike on over to their house.</p>
<p>There are some things that robots still can't do, you see, and those
things have gotten more expensive.</p>
<p>Before I return home by bus, I sell my new bike as scrap to a local
manufacturing service for US$97.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The above scenario is based on some things Richard Stallman wrote,
but it isn't an attempt to represent his point of view.  Violeta is a
real person, but Yésica is not.)</p>
<p>XXX why did you sell the bicycle?</p>
<h1>Commons-based peer production</h1>
<p>In the last couple of decades, we've seen a really remarkable shift in
production from the market economy into ad-hoc volunteer networks
engaging in something Yochai Benkler calls "commons-based peer
production": people contributing resources on a voluntary basis to a
common product that everyone can use without restriction.  Examples of
such products are Wikipedia; Stack Overflow's collection of technical
questions and answers; the worldwide repository of data available
through BitTorrent; the worldwide tourist lodging system CouchSurfing;
the FreeBSD system that is the basis of Apple's MacOS and iOS
operating systems; the WebKit browser engine that drives Chrome,
Safari, the Android browser, and the iOS browser (known as Mobile
Safari); and arguably the collection of videos on YouTube, the social
graph and other information on Facebook, the corpus of photos on
Flickr, and the contents of other such "user-generated content" sites.</p>
<p>I say "arguably" because these proprietary sites aren't governed by
the same liberal commons-protecting licenses that enable the
communities I listed earlier, so I'm not sure if they fit Benkler's
definition, but much of the same dynamics seem to apply.  Whether you
upload zero, one, or a thousand photos to Flickr, you can still look
at the commons of all the photos on the site, produced by your peers.
(I'm embarrassed to admit I haven't managed to make it through
Benkler's book yet, so I'm not totally sure where he draws the line
around "commons-based peer production".)</p>
<p>This is a remarkable phenomenon.  One after another, we see
market-economic projects collapsing when they have to compete with
commons-based peer production, much as the Soviet Union eventually
collapsed economically when its system of production could not compete
with the capitalist bloc.</p>
<p>Apple had 20 years of experience as one of the most innovative and
often financially successful producers of computer software, employing
many of the best programmers in the world, when it decided to cancel
its in-house next-generation operating system project and switch to
NeXTStep, much of which is free software.  Apple's own internal
software development project simply could not compete with the
commons-based peer production of FreeBSD — although so far its user
interface seems to be holding its own against Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, similarly, completely crushed Encyclopedia Britannica,
Microsoft Encarta, and the other lesser-known commercial
encyclopedias.</p>
<p>Never before has capitalism found itself face-to-face with a system it
can't compete with economically.  The only feasible response, taken by
Wikia, YouTube, Facebook, and so on, seems to be to try to build a
"commons" that in reality is privately owned by you, so everybody else
does the work of constructing the economically valuable product, while
you take home the profits.  People seem to be starting to realize that
this is not such a hot idea, but it's going to be a while before we
can fix the problem.  But that's not what I want to talk about now.</p>
<p>You can also argue that this trend is unjust, because it takes
economic rewards away from creative people or from the majority of the
population, which is also a really interesting discussion to have, but
that's also not the discussion I want to have in this post.  Bookmark
the idea for later, because I want to talk about it in a later post.</p>
<h1>How far can commons-based peer production go?</h1>
<p>It's reasonable to ask how far this trend of replacing market economic
production with commons-based peer production can go, assuming it's
not already played out.  Wikipedia, for example, has replaced the
encyclopedia market, but there still seem to be lots of other books
out there.  A lot of the fiction books can maybe be replaced by fanfic
sites; Wikipedia and the WikiBooks project of the Wikimedia foundation
are working to replace other nonfiction books, as is Stack Exchange
(the family of sites including Stack Overflow); BitTorrent and YouTube
are replacing TV to some extent; Android is largely replacing
Microsoft Windows; but what about the implications for things that
aren't pure information?  Physical things like recumbent bicycles,
chairs, highways, swimming pools, clothing, food, housing, clean
water, headphones, and antibiotics?</p>
<h2>Let's investigate how physical things are created</h2>
<p>Well, those physical things are all produced by the following
unreasonably general process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>raw materials</strong> are</li>
<li>combined and modified by <strong>energy</strong> under the control of</li>
<li><strong>existing durable physical things</strong>, which are guided by</li>
<li>a <strong>design</strong> or plan which is chosen ahead of time,</li>
<li>then adapted according to <strong>feedback</strong> from the production process,
   to a greater or lesser extent; we could call this "improvisation".</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of a bicycle, for example, the raw materials include
wheels, a frame, a seat, and a chain; the energy moves the parts into
place relative to each other and tightens the nuts needed to hold them
together; the existing durable physical things probably include some
wrenches and a chain tool; the design consists mostly of the
mechanic's choice of which of these raw materials to use; and feedback
is used, perhaps, to discover that the chain chosen was too short and
needs to be lengthened by adding some links, or to replace the desired
double-walled aluminum front wheel with the single-walled steel front
wheel that happens to be in stock.</p>
<p>But each of these "raw" materials is itself a physical object, and is
produced in the same way.  The frame is made from raw materials of
metal tubing, consumable welding electrodes, paint, headset bearings,
brakes, the pedal assembly (I forget what this is called in English;
in Spanish it's the "caja pedalera"); the energy needed to combine
them includes the energy to cut the tubing, melt the welding rods,
aerosolize the paint, and tighten the pedal assembly and headset
bearings; the existing durable physical things include the paint
sprayer, the arc welding buzzbox, and some more wrenches; the design
describes, among other things, exactly how long each piece of tubing
should be, which alloy it should consist of, the shape of the cuts to
make, and how much metal to deposit in welding; and the adaptation in
response to feedback may involve, for example, re-welding spots on the
weld that melted through the first time.</p>
<p>If you carry out the recursion all the way, you find that the raw
materials for a bicycle consist of most of the 89 or so natural
elements: the tires are made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen,
and sulfur, for example, while a steel tube may be made of iron,
carbon, chromium, molybdenum, nickel, and silicon, and an acrylic
fairing is just carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.  The existing durable
physical things necessary to process these raw elements into a bicycle
currently include blast furnaces, zone melting facilities, hydrocarbon
cracking towers, other chemical process plants (including their
catalysts), welders, cutting tools, and so on, each of which uses
energy in its own way, although largely to heat things up, cool them
down, or move them around.  (We can imagine machinery that used a
narrower range of processes and of materials, but making an acceptable
bicycle entirely out of them seems like it will be a big challenge.)
The design covers everything from the crystal structure of the wheel
hub to the overall bicycle weight.</p>
<p>A sandwich is made of the same raw materials, although in somewhat
different proportions, but much of the design is provided by genetic
material, and much of the energy is provided by the sun through
photosynthesis.  Plant growth is really interesting because, although
it's a fully automatic process, the final design of the plant can be
extremely varied as a result of adaptation to its environment
("feedback" or "improvisation" in the framework above), both in its
physical form and in its chemical content.  The same variety of beans
can taste quite different depending on how much you water them and
what kind of soil they grow in.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of looking at things this way is that almost
none of these raw materials are typically depleted.  Helium can be
depleted by escaping the atmosphere, and a few of the natural elements
(like radium and radon) decay into other natural elements, but they're
being constantly produced by thorium and uranium, which are decaying
but not at an appreciable rate.  And since bicycles and sandwiches are
made of the same elements, you can recycle bicycles into sandwiches,
or sandwiches into bicycles.</p>
<p>This framework even applies to, for example, manufacturing a copy of
Firefox.  The raw materials are a small area of ferromagnetic oxide on
a spinning disk platter; a small amount of energy is used to magnetize
them in a particular sequence, under the control of the disk head and,
eventually, a whole computer; the design is the bits of Firefox that
have been downloaded over the web and reside in memory, awaiting being
written to the disk; and there's a certain amount of feedback involved
in choosing which disk sectors to write.  This may sound absurd, but
the process is essentially the same as printing a book on your laser
printer, except that the raw materials are a little harder to recycle.</p>
<p>Traditionally, in a manufactured product, the raw materials were drawn
from a relatively small set of natural materials and refined alloys,
perhaps a few hundred for most products; the energy was provided by
human muscles; the existing durable physical things were
general-purpose tools; the design was produced, or perhaps remembered,
by an master craftsman; and feedback was also exercised by the
craftsman.</p>
<p>In this framework, then, the First Industrial Revolution was, more or
less, simply a result of replacing the source of energy with a more
inexpensive source of energy: coal producing steam.  The Second
Industrial Revolution, centered on mass production, was more or less a
matter of reducing the need for feedback to a minimum, largely
provided by the introduction of many specialized existing durable
physical things ("tools") but also by improved measurements that
reduced the variation between objects, and a much wider variety of raw
materials.  The Japanese dominance of manufacturing was largely
because they reincorporated ubiquitous feedback, but at a different
scale — the workers worked to use feedback to optimize the process,
not to fix an individual produced artifact.</p>
<p>So of these five factors of production, all five were originally very
expensive; making #2 cheaper created the British Empire; shifting some
cost from #5 to #3 created the Second Industrial Revolution and the
American Century; and making #5 cheaper instead of eliminating it
created the richest country in the world, at least if you measure by
life expectancy.</p>
<p>So, within this framework, here's what I predict will happen to the
cost of manufacturing in the next few years:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Raw materials, in the sense of elements, are becoming progressively
   more available, because people keep mining them and not putting the
   scarce ones back in the ground.  Even when they do put scarce ones
   back in the ground — for example, the indium in indium tin oxide
   coatings on discarded LCDs, or the cadmium in nickel-cadmium
   batteries — they mostly put them into specific small locations,
   where they should be recoverable later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy is already really cheap, as it has been for a century, but
   it's going to get a lot cheaper soon, because as of 2013,
   photovoltaic power plants have gotten cheaper than fossil-fuel
   plants in sunny parts of the world.  Without subsidies.  And a
   substantial part of their remaining cost comes from the energy
   needed to make them.  Almost none of it comes from the cost of the
   elemental raw materials, primarily silicon and aluminum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing durable physical things have their cost determined by the
   cost of manufacturing them, so they fall out of the analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designing things is still really hard, but designs are just
   informational goods, and it turns out that commons-based peer
   production completely kicks the ass of the market at that.
   Sometimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminating feedback was the core of the Second Industrial
   Revolution because feedback required human attention.  But
   computers are feedback machines, and now they're really cheap!
   Industrial process control was a major use of minicomputers
   starting in the 1970s, and computer-based automation
   (computer-based in order to handle feedback) has been the key to
   the dramatic increase in manufacturing productivity per
   manufacturing worker over the last 30 years.  We can predict that
   this trend will continue, and as a result many of our Fordist
   instincts about how to optimize productivity will turn out to be
   wrong.  (I say this despite the fact that Toffler-style "mass
   customization" has been a highly-hyped business failure for nearly
   30 years now.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So it seems likely that the main cost of manufacturing in the near
future will be raw materials and energy, with some sort of multiplier
for the durable tooling needed; but only insofar as we can sustain
commons-based peer production for manufacturable designs.</p>
<h2>Commons-based peer production will take over most of manufacturing from markets</h2>
<p>That is, within a few years, by far the most expensive part of
manufacturing a bicycle, or nearly anything else we manufacture, will
be designing it.  And that design effort will probably be mostly done
through commons-based peer production, not through a market, because
market economies are generally unable to reach a level of productivity
sufficient to compete with commons-based peer production in areas
where we have figured out how to do commons-based peer production.</p>
<h1>What could prevent this?</h1>
<p>The distributional equality issues I mentioned in passing previously
are a big problem.  They could keep us locked in an outdated
20th-century industrial production model.</p>
<p>There's the usual problem of diffusion of complex innovations:
manufacturing services like the ones I envision above are only useful
if there's a sufficient volume of automatically-manufacturable
parametric models, people who know how to tweak them for their needs,
and software for creating, modifying, and evaluating them; and each of
these other three things depends in the same way on the other three.
So diffusion could take some time.</p>
<p>Environmental collapse, or other forms of societal collapse, could cut
off long-distance communication, which would effectively decimate the
people you could collaborate on models with.  It could also cut off
the long-distance trade needed for the mass-produced "processed"
materials that can't yet be produced locally, such as integrated
circuits.</p>
<p>Robotic automated custom manufacturing could remain dramatically more
expensive than mass production.  We see this, for example, in
integrated circuit manufacturing: IC customization is certainly
possible, using lasers, electron-beam etching, or "programming"
(i.e. blowing fuses), and in fact I think most ICs undergo at least
one of these processes, but the vast majority of the IC manufacturing
process is done with X-ray lithography, the most mass of all
mass-production processes, which commonly produces trillions of
identical parts (such as Flash memory cells) in a single operation.
And semiconductor manufacturing is one of the most highly automated of
all current industrial processes.</p>
<p>Purely competitive concerns could result in people sabotaging each
other's productive capacities.  Israel might have a strong motive to
destroy any general-purpose manufacturing service in Palestianian-
controlled parts of the West Bank, for example, while the Palestinians
might have a strong motive to do the same for general-purpose
manufacturing services in Israeli settlements in the West Bank.  Taken
to the extreme, we could see assassinations of researchers, like those
carried out by the Mossad against Iranian scientists, those carried
out by the Unabomber, and the famous assassination of Gerald Bull.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/history.html">History</a> (71 notes)
