<p>As I was walking out my door earlier tonight to get an empanada, I
noticed that the keys had left a mark by brushing against the paint on
the door, and I thought, wow, I can make pretty intricate patterns in
brass entirely by accident this way.  Wouldn't it be awesome if we
could somehow just <em>draw</em> a computer as a two-dimensional pattern on
paper and have it work?</p>
<p>And it occurred to me that it <em>is</em> actually practical to simply draw a
state transition table and have a simple electromechanical machine
implement the state machine you specified.  Here's the idea.</p>
<h2>The idea (here)</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to implement an arbitrary finite-state machine with a
minimum number of "active" electronic elements (things like vacuum
tubes or transistors).  Here's an interesting approach, sort of
inspired by Shamir's TWINKLE.</p>
<p>You maintain your current N-bit state in N flip-flops with
complementary Q and /Q outputs; typically each flip-flop requires one
or two vacuum tubes, or a locking relay, or two to six transistors,
depending on your logic family and other details.  You hook up the Q
and /Q outputs to lamps: these days, you would surely use laser diodes
or other LEDs, but in the 1940s timeframe where this scenario makes
the most sense, you'd have to use something else, maybe neon lamps.
The lamps give you a matrix of N rows of two lamps, one of which is on
at any given time.</p>
<p>A reasonable value for N here might be 3 to 20.</p>
<p>Now you put these lamps close to a strip of paper.  The lamps reflect
diffusely off the paper and illuminate the environment.  If there are
dark blots on the paper under an illuminated lamp, that will diminish
the overall illumination reflected from the lamps.</p>
<p>With a lens per lamp --- not necessarily a very good lens --- you can
do this trick with the lamps some distance from the paper.  The idea
is that each lamp just illuminates a corresponding spot on the paper.</p>
<p>Suppose the paper is a vertical strip, divided into rows of two
squares, one square for each lamp; and just as one of the two lamps in
each row is lit, one of the two squares in each row is light, while
the other one is dark.  Now the illumination reflected from each row
is the XOR or XNOR of a bit of our state and the corresponding bit on
the paper.  If we slide the paper vertically, the illumination will
fluctuate with time as the Hamming distance between the current state
and the selected subset of the bit pattern on the paper varies.</p>
<p>Now, instead of sliding bits of paper around, we can wrap this strip
of paper around a rotating drum.  As the drum rotates, the number of
matching bits on these two tracks of the drum will vary, and so will
the reflected light.  It will reach a minimum when every lamp is
illuminating a black area.</p>
<p>How small is that minimum?  Asphalt has a visible-light albedo of
0.04; I think carbon black is a little darker than that.  Polished
aluminum has a reflectance of about 0.95, although I think it gets a
little worse when unpolished.  But basically we can have a contrast
ratio of about 20 or 25 between black and white on paper without doing
anything exotic.  That means that if you have 5 bits and all 5 of them
match, you'll have about 0.04 × 5 = 0.2 of the light from one bit;
while if only 4 match, you'll have 0.04 × 4 + 0.95 × 1 = 1.11 of the
light from one bit, about 4½ times as much.  So this is an easily
detectable event: the ratio between a perfect match and a near match
is about a factor of 4.  You should be able to detect this event with
a photodiode or even an electric eye.</p>
<p>Suppose that an adjacent track of the drum carries another pattern of
bright and dark squares, containing desired new states for your
flip-flops.  If you have more lamps and photodetectors close to it,
one per bit, they can read the pattern without leaking much light into
the environment.</p>
<p>Now, as the drum turns, the apparatus searches for a matching state on
the drum; when the reflected light level falls to a minimum, it knows
it has found it, and it loads the specified new state into the
flip-flops from the other track.  It's probably desirable for the
"pattern" bits being matched on the track to be somewhat short, so
that the new-state bits are well centered under their detectors by the
time the detector fires, as follows:</p>
<pre><code> Q /Q  newstate
--     ##
   --
   --  ##
--     ##
</code></pre>
<p>You probably do need a mechanism that prevents a misaligned match:
say, N-1 bits of one pattern and 1 bit of the following one.  One way
is to have an extra framing "bit" that is always illuminated on both
sides, marking the paper dark on both tracks:</p>
<pre><code> Q /Q  newstate
--     ##
   --
   --  ##
--     ##
-----
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could just space the rows unevenly, or even leave a
fractional-row-sized space between patterns.</p>
<p>The (N+1)×3 arrangement described above is just one of many
possibilities.  You could just as well put all the bits on one track,
and the lamps in a line; or you could put each bit in a separate
track, producing 3N tracks and one bit-height per pattern, which is
probably the highest-performance option; here we have three
transitions:</p>
<pre><code>Q1 /Q1 Q2 /Q2 Q3 /Q3 Q4 /Q4 Q1' Q2' Q3' Q4'
--        --  --     --     ##  ##  ##
--        --  --         -- ##  ##  ##  ##
--        --     --      -- ##  ##
</code></pre>
<p>Simple latches, without edge-triggering, probably suffice for the
flip-flops, because each transition will be either to the same state
or to a different state.  If it's to the same state, it's idempotent,
so it's harmless to execute it continuously until the marks pass; and
if it's to a different state, then it will execute until the lamps
display enough of the new state that the light level rises above the
level that triggers the state-transitioning logic.  You just have to
be careful that the transition is sufficiently well-established that
all the bits have changed as they should, and none is left in a
metastable state.</p>
<h2>Further variations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The natural approach to arranging the patterns on the drum is just
  to put them in numerical sequence, evenly spaced around the drum, so
  that you execute about two transitions per revolution.  But you can
  also repeat them so that some transitions have the opportunity to
  execute many times, and so that transitions that happen in sequence
  are placed in sequence, and of course you can repeat the entire
  sequence of transitions.  Furthermore, you can use the drum position
  as an additional, less flexible state variable, so that the entire
  state machine cycles through different transition graphs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, one or more of the bits used to select the pattern can
  actually be an input, rather than a stored bit.  You probably want
  to make sure the input doesn't change while you're using it to
  choose your next state; you can sample-and-hold it, or use an actual
  edge-triggered flip-flop, if it can change state arbitrarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's possible to encode "don't care" bits by coloring both sides of
  the pattern bit, potentially reducing the number of patterns
  dramatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have both "new Qi" and "new /Qi" bits on the paper, you may
  be able to simplify the transitioning logic to simply illuminating
  them when the reflected "pattern" light falls below the threshold.
  That is, the nonlinear element that switches between retaining the
  existing state and adopting a new one can be simply the power supply
  of the lamps illuminating these bits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have both "new Qi" and "new /Qi" bits as described above, you
  have the additional option of <em>not</em> switching some bits, allowing
  them to retain a memory independent of the state transition being
  executed; this can allow a dramatic reduction in the number of
  transitions by, among other things, allowing you to preserve "don't
  care" bits, and allowing different subsets of the state
  independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your state variables don't need to be binary --- they can have more
  than two stable states.  Indeed, ternary variables will give you
  slightly more states for patterns of the same size, and may be more
  convenient to work with; and quaternary variables (one-hot out of
  four) will give you patterns of the same size, but half the lamps
  illuminated, and so they may be easier to do the threshold logic
  with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use a tape or disc rather than a drum for a more compact
  machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a better contrast ratio and fewer materials, you can use punched
  or drilled holes rather than marks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could use the state where all of the bits are <em>reflected</em> (or
  transmitted) instead of all <em>absorbed</em> as the trigger state, but I
  figured that was probably harder, since the difference between
  almost-all-bits-reflected and all-bits-reflected will be, say, 10%
  to 33%, which will be harder to discriminate reliably than the 350%
  or more between almost-all-bits-absorbed and all-bits-absorbed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than using diffuse reflection and absorption, you could use
  specular reflection of collimated light and diffuse reflection.  For
  example, if you're using something like a hard disk platter, a
  scratched or etched spot in its surface will scatter light at
  random, while an untouched spot will produce a collimated reflected
  beam from a collimated incident beam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have an additional hardware budget, you could of course
  replace the pattern tracks and the light detector with a counter
  circuit and digital comparator, leaving only the new-state tracks
  and a timing mark for restarting the counter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do the whole thing in a hard vacuum, you could use electron
  beams instead of light, which might make it faster, depending on
  your light source.  You'd have to use an unlubricated bearing to
  spin the drum if you were doing this on Earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course you can connect some of your state bits to control some
  other device, such as a memory, which would then provide some of the
  input bits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What this gets you</h2>
<p>If N=4 plus one bit of input, this should give you an arbitrary
sixteen-state state machine for the cost of somewhere around five to
forty active elements, depending on what they are; and its speed
should be limited to something like one transition per sixteen times
its lamps' response time.  That is, if your indicator lamps respond in
100ns, you should be able to do an arbitrary transition in 1600ns.
This is dependent on actually testing a pattern every 100ns; at
5400rpm and a radius of 4cm, your patterns will need to be about 2
microns across, which means your lamps' illumination spots will need
to be about that size too, and you might need to make sure they were
aligned to within that precision, too.  200 microns is probably more
practical if you want to be able to construct the thing without
resorting to a microscope, and you can probably spin a 40-cm-radius
drum at 5400rpm, practically speaking, giving you a microsecond per
candidate phase transition.</p>
<p>The great disadvantage of this approach is that the state machine's
real-time performance is fairly poor, so it can't interface directly
with things like delay lines unless they're very slow indeed.</p>
<h3>A potential 1920s realization using only neon glow lamps</h3>
<p>I think that if you accept some further slowdown, although not quite
to the level of magnetic relay logic, you can build it with a couple
of 1920s neon glow lamps for each flip-flop.  I haven't really played
with the things, but I think that this topology gives you a flip-flop:</p>
<pre><code>                          A
                          |
                _( NE-2 )_|__/\/\/\__
               / (  L1  )      R1    \
VCC           /                       \__
+___/\/\/\___/                        / |
      R3     \                       /  |
              \__( NE-2 )____/\/\/\_/   |
                 (  L2  ) |    R2      _|_
                          |            /// GND
                          B
</code></pre>
<p>If "VCC" is above the striking voltage of the lamps (say 110 volts),
then either L1 or L2 will ionize and start to conduct at about three
milliamps; at this point the voltage across it will drop, to about 70
volts IIRC, and if enough of the remainder is dropped across R3, the
other lamp will not ionize.  You can measure the voltage at points A
and B to see which lamp is conducting; the other one will be at zero
volts.  And if you apply a sufficient positive voltage at A (anything
from about 50 volts up to not too far above "VCC"), you can get L1 to
stop conducting if it's conducting beforehand, ensuring that L2 is
conducting afterwards; and likewise for B.</p>
<p>This might avoid the need for separate indicator lamps, but NE-2s are
pretty small, dim, and red, so your light detector has to be pretty
good.  However, there are other neon glow lamps that work the same way
that produce more light.  In extreme steampunky cases, you could
perhaps even use a carbon arc lamp, which displays more or less the
same bistable negative-resistance behavior that neon glow lamps do, so
much so that the Pearson arc oscillator used it to power an RF
oscillator circuit.</p>
<p>This flip-flop can be extended to multiple branches; as I sort of
mentioned before, three alternatives gives you slightly better
efficiency than two; six lamps in two three-branch circuits of this
type can encode nine alternatives, compared to eight if they're
grouped into three two-branch circuits.</p>
<p>So how do you connect a high voltage to A or B when one of the
next-state bits gets illuminated?  In today's world you'd probably
amplify a signal from a photodiode to trigger a triac or SCR or
something.  But using neon lamps?  They're slightly light-sensitive,
and in their negative-resistance region, capable of amplification, so
theoretically this ought to be possible, but I don't know enough of
the details.</p>
<p>You do have the advantage that the light from the "new state" bits can
be as strong as you like (although only 20 or 25 times stronger than
their dark counterparts), since you're just turning the light source
off when you're not transitioning to a new state, so let's suppose
that we can do it with three resistors and two neon lamps for each of
A and B.  That means each of our N=4 bits of state consists of 6 lamps
and 9 resistors, for a total of 24 lamps and 36 resistors; our bit of
input requires perhaps two lamps and two or three resistors.</p>
<p>That leaves only the problem of detecting the darkness that triggers
the transition and firing up the transition circuits.  I'll guess
arbitrarily that that will need five more lamps and eight more
resistors, for a total of 29 lamps and 44 resistors.</p>
<p>It's also feasible to use electromechanical relays, of course.  Modern
mercury-wetted reed relays can run up to 40kHz.  But they can't detect
light; for that you need an electric-eye vacuum tube at least, if not
an avalanche gas tube.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
