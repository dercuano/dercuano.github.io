(2 minutes)</div><p>An observation from Unix is that it's often more convenient to
structure a computation as a set of concurrent processes, each
applying some simple transformation to one or more data streams, than
to force everything into a single thread.</p>
<p>I'm observing this right now in a $work project that is scraping data
from a server, respecting API rate limits, where the explicit state
machine that handles API errors is gradually getting more and more
complicated.  In a well-structured program, this state machine would
be written as a composition of primitive actions using sequences,
conditionals, and iteration, with the state of the state machine
encoded in the program counter; but since each API response from the
server is handled by a callback function, this is not straightforward.</p>
<p>A simple way to handle this is to spawn off a separate thread that has
a blocking proxy object for the API.  When it calls a method on the
blocking proxy object, this sends a message to the server (via the
callback thread if necessary) and waits until the callback thread gets
a response, either success, error, or if necessary, a timeout.  Then I
can write my retry and looping logic in this other thread using normal
structured control flow and block-structured local variables, instead
of a passel of boolean variables and suchlike.</p>
<p>This would work well on this project, where I have just one thread —
although I'm probably not going to do it, because I don't expect to
modify that code enough more to justify such a rewrite — but there are
some practical memory difficulties with large numbers of threads.</p>
