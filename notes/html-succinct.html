<p>HTML is more succinct for things in its intended domain than
S-expressions, but still has better error-detection and correction
capabilities.</p>
<p>S-expression fans like to say that HTML, SGML, and XML are just
bastardized S-expression languages.  SGML partisans often respond that
matching end-tags allow for better error-reporting and correction.
But for typical HTML content --- mostly running text with a little bit
of interspersed markup --- S-expressions are not only harder to
correct, but also more verbose.</p>
<p>Consider this partial paragraph from the Ur-Scheme web page
<a href="http://pobox.com/~kragen/sw/urscheme">http://pobox.com/~kragen/sw/urscheme</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reasonably fast.&lt;/b&gt; It &lt;b&gt;generates reasonably fast
code&lt;/b&gt; &amp;mdash; when compiled with itself, it runs 2½ times
faster (in user CPU time) than when it's compiled with &lt;a
href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/"
&gt;Chicken&lt;/a&gt;, 1½ times faster than when it's compiled with...&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, in traditional HTML, I could have left out the quotes around the
URL and the ending <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag.  Consider this S-expression version:</p>
<pre><code>(li (b "Reasonably fast.") " It " (b "generates reasonably fast
code") " " mdash " when compiled with itself, it runs 2½ times
faster (in user CPU time) than when it's compiled with "
(a :href "http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/"
"Chicken") ", 1½ times faster than when it's compiled with...")
</code></pre>
<p>Most of the markup constructs take up more characters here:</p>
<pre><code>LI: '&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;'    (end tag could be omitted in traditional HTML)
    '(li "")'
B:  '&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;'
    '(b "") '
B:  '&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;'      (the second one)
    '" (b "") "'
--- '&amp;mdash;'
    '" mdash "'
A:  '&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'  (quotes could traditionally be omitted)
    '" (a :href "" "") "'
</code></pre>
<p>If you look at this in a fixed-width font, you'll see that the number
of markup characters is detectably smaller in the S-expression
serialization of the structure, with the exception of the first two.
I maintain that this is typical of the bulk of HTML, especially if you
weight it by how often people write it instead of how often it gets
sent to browsers.  You can come up with examples where that is not the
case:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;
             &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../../style.css" /&gt;
             &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="..." /&gt;
             &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;...&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>vs.</p>
<pre><code>(html (head (title "...") (link :rel "stylesheet" :href "../../style.css")
            (meta :http-equiv "Content-Type" :content "...")
            (style :type "text/css" "...")))
</code></pre>
<p>but those structure-heavy, text-light examples with long-winded tag
names are relatively rare for people to read and write.</p>
<p>Of course, the cost of terser syntax is often that errors are hard to
diagnose.  Ada's <code>end loop</code>, <code>end if</code>, <code>end record</code>, and so on mean
that if you leave out an <code>end</code> delimiter, the compiler will usually be
able to tell you which one you left out.  At the opposite end of the
spectrum, S-expression languages in which all the various kinds of
<code>end</code> are spelled as <code>)</code> can only tell you when they get to the end of
the program or to something that doesn't make sense in the current
context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not a phenomenon limited to end-delimiters.  In
programming languages, there are many other examples of verbosity
that helps to diagnose errors; for example, explicit type
declarations, mandatory delimiter characters (in cases where the
syntax would be no more ambiguous if they were removed from the
grammar), sequences of single-line comments, and the conventional
parenthesization of the arguments of fixed-arity functions ("ratio
square sin x square sin y" is perfectly unambiguous, after all,
and Forth, PostScript, Logo, and REBOL use more or less that
syntax.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in the case of HTML, the terser syntax does not make errors
harder to diagnose; in fact, the HTML syntax permits better
error-detection and even error-correction, because all of the end-tags
are explicitly labeled.  (It differs from SGML in this regard; in
SGML, you can write <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b/Reasonably fast./ It ...&lt;/&gt;</code> and eliminate
the redundant end-tags altogether.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/syntax.html">Syntax</a> (28 notes)
