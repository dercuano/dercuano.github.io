(8 minutes)</div><p>I wrote a thing a while back called "synthgramelodia", which randomly
synthesizes melodies from a grammar, many of which are listenable.
Its homepage, which is currently just a list of outputs, is at
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/synthgramelodia">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/synthgramelodia</a>.  I should probably
at least put the software there.</p>
<p>I think it's probably possible and worthwhile to use this same grammar
for interactive improvisational composition, but I don't feel up to
actually implementing it at the moment.  (I'm horizontal with what I
think is a flu.)  But I think I can explain the idea.</p>
<p>Synthgramelodia uses a tiny six-production grammar of melodies which
is capable, in theory, of expressing basically any chromatic melody
using the Chinese equal-temperament scale and the binary note values
used in mainstream Western music today; but it's intended to be biased
towards things that will sound "nice", so that the result will often
be listenable, and it uses a DAG to promote repetition of motifs with
some variation.</p>
<p>The grammar can be expressed as follows in a single line:</p>
<pre><code>m ::= "." | [a-z] | _&lt;m&gt; | +&lt;m&gt; | (&lt;m&gt; &lt;m&gt;) | (&lt;m&gt; ^ &lt;m&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>The two fundamental atomic melodies of the grammar are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>Rest</strong>, written <code>.</code>, which is a silence lasting one beat, and</li>
<li>a <strong>NoteScore</strong>, written with a letter <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, etc., to indicate
  which of the synthesizer's various "instruments" to play.  A NoteScore
  by itself represents the instrument being played for a single beat at
  220Hz, which is A3 or A below middle C.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of these, there are four compound melody types which modify one
or more melodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>Transpose</strong>, written <code>_x</code>, where <code>x</code> is the melody being
  transposed; it represents the same melody as <code>x</code>, except lower in
  pitch by a perfect fifth.</li>
<li>a <strong>Louder</strong>, written <code>+x</code>, where <code>x</code> is the melody being amplified;
  it represents the same melody as <code>x</code>, except louder in volume by 3
  dB;</li>
<li>a <strong>Sequence</strong>, written <code>(x y)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are two melodies
  being concatenated, which consists of first the notes of <code>x</code> and
  then the notes of <code>y</code>; if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are of different lengths, the
  shorter one is slowed down to equal the longer one in length.  Also,
  <code>y</code> is reduced in volume by 2 dB.</li>
<li>a <strong>Parallel</strong>, written <code>(x ^ y)</code> where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are two melodies
  being played simultaneously; <code>y</code> is raised in pitch by an octave,
  while the bass line <code>x</code> is left unchanged, and if they are of
  different lengths, the longer of the two is accelerated in order to
  be of the same length as the shorter.</li>
</ul>
<p>(At some point, I replaced the stretching of the shorter melody with
repetition, which I don't think improved it.)</p>
<p>Synthgramelodia builds up random melody DAGs using these productions
or node types in a bottom-up fashion that tends to reuse the same node
in many parts of the tree, with the result that you tend to hear the
same motif at diferent speeds and transposed to different pitches,
although not using different instruments.</p>
<p>It should be apparent that you can raise a melody's pitch arbitrarily
high by paralleling it with a bass line consisting of a rest several
times, lower it arbitrarily low by transposing it several times, reach
any chromatic pitch by combining these two, amplify it arbitrarily by
loudering it many times, accelerate it arbitrarily by concatenating it
with many rests (or with itself) and then paralleling it with a single
rest, and slow it down arbitrarily to an arbitrarily slow speed by
concatenating it with a long sequence of rests, although at the cost
of embedding it in a longer silence.</p>
<p>It should also be apparent that the only reachable pitches are in the
chromatic scale, the only reachable melody lengths are powers of 2,
and all integer numbers of decibels are reachable amplitudes.</p>
<p>(It might make more sense to reverse the speedup/slowdown semantics of
Parallel and Sequence, so that you can slow things down arbitrarily by
paralleling them with a long silence, while speeding them up would
just require concatenating them with a single rest; or maybe make a
separate node type for speeding things up.)</p>
<p>Given all this, it also seems clear that you should be able to write
an expression (infix or Forthlike) to generate a "gramelodia", perhaps
even synthesizing it in real time as you improvise.  I suspect that
some kind of Forth-like interface, like GlitchMachine, is probably the
best way to edit this; it gives you a linear thing you can edit which
is essentially immune to syntax errors.</p>
<p>Constructing arbitrary DAGs on a Forth stack might seem
tricky. Arbitrary trees are of course straightforward: the postorder
traversal of the tree forms the Forth-style command sequence, and
you're done.  Some DAGs can of course be constructed with nothing more
than "dup", but you need some amount of stack manipulation to
construct things like <code>(a b) (a c)</code>.</p>
<p>If we consider a Forth two-stack machine as a sort of Turing machine
that can insert and delete cells on its tape, we can see that the four
operations <code>dup</code>, <code>r&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;r</code>, and <code>shift</code> are sufficient to shuttle nodes
around in order to construct arbitrary DAGs. With the operand stack on
the left, the auxiliary ("return") stack on the right, and
top-of-stack outlined with parens, these operations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dup</code>: "... (a) ..." → "... a (a) ..."</li>
<li><code>&gt;r</code>: "... b (a) ..." → "... (b) a ..."</li>
<li><code>r&gt;</code>: "... (b) a ..." → "... b (a) ..."</li>
<li><code>shift</code>: "...(a) b ..." → "... b (a) ..."</li>
</ul>
<p>The sequence of cells on the tape, omitting duplication, remains
unchanged except by <code>shift</code>, which moves the current top-of-stack to
the right on the tape, which can be repeated until it reaches the
position it needs to combine with whatever it needs to combine with;
<code>&gt;r</code> and <code>r&gt;</code> move the head left or right on the tape; and <code>dup</code> is
what you do to use a node in two places.  (Arguably the duplicate
ought to be on the auxiliary stack to the right, not the main stack to
the left.)</p>
<p>I've made several attempts to reduce this to three operations, but
none has yet been successful.  There's probably something hiding just
out of sight; but, for example, with just <code>r!</code>, <code>shift</code>, and <code>r&gt;</code>,
there's no way to write <code>swap</code>, which is a problem in the presence of
non-commutative operations like the gramelodia melody combinations;
and if you integrate <code>dup</code> into one of the other operations, you
probably need to add <code>drop</code> as well.</p>
<p>You could imagine a live display not only of the melody, but also the
sheet music, the DAG, sheet music for individual DAG nodes, an infix
version of it, and a highlight on each of these indicating where your
editing cursor is in the Forth sequence; and also keys to jump your
cursor to the construction of one or the other top stack items at that
point in execution, so you can navigate the DAG structurally.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
