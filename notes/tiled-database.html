<p>So I was talking to someone today about a network monitoring database
problem I'd run into previously.  A lot of network monitoring systems
store many gigabytes of historical data about, say, bandwidth used per
device, in order to support queries later on.  Common queries include
things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>what was the bandwidth used on device X in every five-minute
  interval over the last week?</li>
<li>what was the aggregate bandwidth used by each of the devices in
  such-and-such a group?</li>
<li>what were the five devices that used the most bandwidth over
  such-and-such a period?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's nice to have queries like these be answered very quickly, but
existing tools like Postgres and RRDTool don't seem to perform very
well.</p>
<p>To be concrete, suppose that you have 100 000 devices, and you poll
each one for input bytes, output bytes, input packets, output packets,
input errors, and output errors once every minute.  Each of these
numbers may get too big to record in 32 bits, so it's good to use 64.
So that's 8 * 6 * 100 000 = 4.8 megabytes per minute, or 7 gigabytes
per day, or 200 gigabytes per month.</p>
<h2>Disk Model</h2>
<p>My standard model of a disk is that a disk is something that takes
8-10ms to start reading or writing at a random spot, and then reads or
writes at 40MB/sec as long as it's reading or writing sequentially.
Some disks (or disk arrays) are five times faster (bandwidth-wise) and
some are five times slower, and most have faster seeks under some
special circumstances, but that's generally the right ballpark.</p>
<p>An interesting number that comes out of this is the bandwidth-delay
product, which is about 10ms * 40MB/s = 400kB.  If you're alternating
between reading or writing a chunk of some fixed size, and seeking to
a new location, this is the chunk size at which you spend only half of
your time seeking.  Reading or writing in chunks much smaller than
this means the disk spends most of its time seeking; reading or
writing in chunks much larger means the disk spends most of its time
transferring data.</p>
<p>Bandwidth varies between disks more than seek time, so bandwidth-delay
products vary quite a bit.</p>
<h2>Approaches to Solving It</h2>
<p>The usual way of dealing with this is to use RRDTool, which stores
each counter for each device in a separate file, and thins out old
data so as to keep a fixed upper limit on the total number of samples
in any one file.  RRDTool makes queries about one or a small number of
devices quite fast, but updating of a large number of counters is
slow, since each one is in a different file.</p>
<p>Because the data is so large, it's a bit expensive to keep it all in
RAM, so it would be nice if both updates and queries had reasonable
locality of reference.  If you're updating 7 gigabytes of RRDTool
files (11520 bytes per counter, to store 1-minute data for a day), you
pretty much have to read and then write 7 gigabytes of data, which is
going to take at least three minutes on a single disk; but we're
hypothesizing that the actual amount of new data being written is
maybe 4.8 megabytes.  So the RRDTool approach imposes largish costs on
mass updates due to poor locality of reference.</p>
<p>You could go to the other extreme and optimize for writes: write all
the new counter data in one big 5-meg blob.  But then reading the 1440
one-minute samples for a single counter over a day's time requires
1440 disk reads, 5 megabytes apart, and perhaps 10 seconds.  This is
not acceptable either.</p>
<h2>My Proposed Solution: Tiling</h2>
<p>This points at a solution I had suggested in "r-tree indices for
database table clustered indices",
http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2004-January/000748.html
which is to sort of divide the data into "tiles" of, say, 64 minutes
by 1024 counters, each occupying a contiguous half-megabyte.  We can
assume (for now) that getting from any tile to any other tile requires
a random disk seek.  So if you're recording six new 64-bit readings
for each of 100 000 devices, those 600 000 readings get broken up into
600 groups of 1024, and each of those 600 groups gets written into a
separate tile.  If each requires a separate seek, this should take
about six seconds instead of six minutes.  And if you're reading the
1440 one-minute samples for a single counter over a day's time, those
will be spread across 23 tiles, so will require about 1/2 second.</p>
<p>That's an improvement, but there are several more directions of
optimization possible: side files, tile ordering, thinned data, and
grouping counters by type.</p>
<h2>Side Files</h2>
<p>First, we can initially append updates to a "side file" instead of
sending them directly into their final locations, then eventually copy
the data to the tiles where it will ultimately live.  To start with,
every query must read the entire side file, so you don't want it to
get too big, and it cuts the theoretical write bandwidth of the
database by a factor of three or four, since every update must first
be written to the side file (with metadata), then read from the side
file and written again to a new location.</p>
<p>But now writing 600 000 readings --- 5 megabytes without the metadata
that tells what they are, and perhaps 10 megabytes with it --- takes a
quarter of a second instead of six seconds, which seems like it's
better than an order of magnitude speedup.  However, the eventual
writes to the tiles will still take time, but as explained below, we
can accumulate several updates for each tile, and deliver them in the
same number of seeks.</p>
<p>If we batch up four updates in the side file before flushing them out
to the tiles, the side file will get to 40MB, which is maybe one
second of disk bandwidth.  Copying it to the 600 tiles will take a
second and a half of bandwidth and 600 seeks, so about 7-8 seconds to
do the copying and 8-9 seconds in all --- about 30% of the total disk
traffic the four updates would need without the side file.  (This
copying can be done incrementally rather than all at once, which
allows you to batch up eight updates in the side file at a constant
size of 40MB, or four at a constant size of 20MB.  That's assuming
it's practical to reorder stuff in the side file as some of it gets
flushed out.)</p>
<p>A 40MB side file would take about a second to read off the disk, and
in the absence of any disk buffering, every query would require that
additional second.  (The assumption is that since it's ordered by the
time at which the updates were made, queries won't have particularly
good locality of reference.)  This would be a good reason to keep the
side file small.</p>
<p>But, actually, you can probably keep the side file in RAM until it's a
quarter of a gigabyte or more, which in this scenario would allow it
to batch up roughly 500 full tiles --- and that's getting close to the
point of diminishing returns, where maintaining a bigger side file
doesn't actually save you any more disk seeks.  Keeping the side file
in RAM means that your queries don't suffer from this additional
second of disk access time, although they may still have to access the
data.</p>
<p>So, in this limit, if you buffer up all the new readings in memory,
while also appending them to a side file (in case of a crash), and
then writing them out to 600 new tiles when those tiles are full, then
every 64 minutes, you write out 600 megabytes of data to the side file
(sequentially --- about 15 seconds) and 300 megabytes of new tiles
(with seeks in between, so 3 seconds of seeks and 7 seconds of data
traffic, for 10 seconds of disk traffic).  That's 25 seconds, or a
little under half a second of disk traffic per update.</p>
<p>So the very approximate time taken for an update, including the
amortized time to eventually write it to the tiles:
<em> Without side files: 6 seconds
</em> With a 40MB batchy side file: 2 seconds
<em> With a 40MB streaming side file: 1 second
</em> With an in-memory batchy 300MB side file: 0.5 seconds</p>
<h2>Tile Ordering</h2>
<p>So far, we've proceeded on the pessimistic assumption that all the
tiles were a whole random seek apart.  But, actually, they have to be
laid out on disk in some sequence or other, so some of them will
actually be sequential with one another.  For example, we could lay
out most or all of the tiles for a particular group of counters
(mostly) sequentially on disk, while tiles for different times are
laid out in different parts of the disk.</p>
<p>This doesn't make anything worse than our previous assumptions, but it
can make them better.  In particular, the 23 tiles in which a single
counter can be found throughout a single day will generally be a
single 10-megabyte read rather than 23 half-megabyte reads, so will
take 1/4 second instead of 1/2 second to read.  An entire week will
take almost 2 seconds.</p>
<p>This optimization can't help by more than about a factor of 2 over the
above design because I picked the tile size to guarantee that we don't
spend more than half of our time seeking in the worst case.  If you
make the tiles a bit smaller, you can improve the results for reading
in the direction the tiles are contiguous in, at the expense of reads
and writes in the other direction.  For example, if we make our tiles
32 minutes by 512 counters, then they will be an eighth of a megabyte
each, and reading the 1440 points for a single counter over a day will
require reading 45 tiles totaling 6 contiguous megabytes, or about
0.16s, rather than 0.25.  But reading a full column (say, to find out
which devices used the most bandwidth over a certain period of time)
would then require reading 1200 discontiguous tiles, for 1200 disk
seeks (about 10 seconds) and 150 megabytes (about 4 seconds), for a
total of about 14 seconds, rather than 600 disk seeks and 300
megabytes, for a total of about 12 seconds.  (See below about grouping
counters by type to improve this.)</p>
<h2>Thinned Data</h2>
<p>You probably want to add additional tiles containing subsets of the
data --- perhaps a data point for each counter every five minutes, or
every half-hour, or every hour, or every day.  If you want to graph
the performance of a particular network device for an entire month,
you probably don't want more than 1000 or 2000 data points, and a data
point for every 20 minutes adds up to 2000 data points in a month.</p>
<p>This way, you can have, say, 2016 points of five-minute data for a
week, in a sequence of 32 contiguous tiles --- 16 megabytes, or 0.4
seconds of disk traffic --- so that you can generate weekly graphs
quickly.  Monthly or yearly graphs are an even bigger savings.</p>
<p>The thinned data will be small compared to the full-size dataset, so
its size probably isn't that important.</p>
<p>RRDTool erases the full-resolution data after making up thinned
versions, so that the database always remains the same size.</p>
<h2>Grouping Counters By Type</h2>
<p>In the section about tile ordering above, I mentioned that figuring
out which devices used the most bandwidth over a certain period of
time would require a really unreasonable query time, since it requires
reading all the tiles for two particular times --- the beginning and
the end of that period.  There are about 600 tiles covering each of
those times, totaling about 600 megabytes, which takes 15 seconds of
disk I/O, plus 1200 disk seeks (10 seconds more), if you need to
read them all.</p>
<p>But the reason we have 600 000 counters is that we're recording 6
different counters per device.  Most queries, like the one suggested
above, probably only touch one or two of the counters --- so if each
tile only contains one kind of counter, we can improve this
substantially.</p>
<p>If the desired results are available in a single counter type, we only
need 200 tiles.  Furthermore, if we have a thinned data set that
happens to place the ends of the period in question in the same column
of tiles, then we only need 100 tiles.  This means we only need to
read 50 megabytes of data and seek 100 times, so we can do the query
in a little over 2 seconds instead of 25.</p>
<p>Queries that need data from every type of counter are very rare.</p>
<h2>Delta-Compression</h2>
<p>As proposed above, each counter has 64 values in a particular tile,
which total 512 bytes if they're 8 bytes each.  But most of the time,
we can probably get away with an 8-byte initial value and a sequence
of changes from the previous value, each of which will usually be 8,
16, or 32 bits.  (0 is probably the most common value.)  If they're 16
bits on average, then we could fit about four times as many values
into the same half-megabyte block, which means that everything needs a
lot less I/O bandwidth and many fewer seeks.</p>
<p>In particular:
- we only need 1.2 megabytes per minute of writes, or 1.7 GB per day,
  or 51 GB per month;
- each tile can hold 128 minutes of 2048 counters;
- the updates for each timestamp get written to 300 tiles;
- the 1440 one-minute samples for a single counter are spread over 12
  tiles, which can be read in 0.11 seconds if they're contiguous;
- the 300 tiles currently being updated can live in an in-memory side
  file of 150 megabytes maximum or 75 megabytes steady-state (assuming
  steady-state is possible); this is assuming we keep things
  compressed in RAM as well;
- writing out those 300 tiles (every 128 minutes) takes 4 seconds of
  write bandwidth and 3 seconds of seeks, or about 0.05 seconds
  (amortized) per update, plus the time to write to the disk version
  of the side file, which may still be bulky.
- thinned data will probably comprise a larger fraction of the file,
  since its deltas will be larger;
- reading 100 000 counters at each of two timestamps will probably
  require reading 50 tiles, which will be 25 megabytes of data, so it
  should be possible to find out which devices used the most bandwidth
  over some arbitrary period in under a second of disk time.</p>
<h2>Further Redundancy</h2>
<p>If you could afford it, then instead of tiling, you could just store
the data twice --- once such that all the data for each counter is
mostly contiguous on disk (i.e. broken up into chunks mostly bigger
than the bandwidth-delay product), and again such that all the data
for each timestamp is mostly contiguous on disk.  Side files would
batch updates as before to allow efficient updates.</p>
<p>This would allow queries that only care about a few timestamps or a
few counters to run with very little I/O, and delta-compression of
counter data might be feasible for the contiguous-by-counter data; it
probably isn't feasible for the contiguous-by-timestamp data.</p>
<h2>Network Bandwidth Requirements</h2>
<p>If you were doing this monitoring using SNMPv2, you could probably do
a bulk-get from each of, say, 10 000 devices, once a minute, and get
back a 1000-byte-or-so response from each one.  That's 10 megabytes
per minute, or 1.3 megabits per second in each direction.  You can get
that kind of performance from ARCNet, or 1978-era Ethernet, or
802.11b, or old 4Mbps Token Ring cards that cost US$5 on eBay in 1997.
I'm assuming you can poll switches or routers or something, one per
ten devices, rather than having to talk to all 100 000 network devices
directly.</p>
<p>An SNMP library that can handle talking to 10 000 agents within a
minute --- perhaps 200 or 300 at any given time, if you have a
reasonable timeout --- may be a little more difficult to come by.
It's not technically very difficult to do, but you have to design your
SNMP library to do it, and not require a separate thread for each
concurrent request.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>It should be inexpensive to log and query several vital statistics of
each device on a large corporate network with a single five-year-old
laptop, maintaining historical data with hourly granularity
indefinitely, using the following techniques.</p>
<p>Batch updates in memory, logging them in a file, flushing them to disk
when necessary.</p>
<p>Each datum is addressed by a tuple (countertype, deviceid, timestamp).
I recommend storing data in physically contiguous tiles of around half
a meg (times or divided by four) addressed by tuples (tilerow,
tilecol), where tilerow is a function of countertype and deviceid and
tilecol is a function of timestamp, such that data from different
countertypes are assigned to different tilerows, and each tilecol
corresponds to a contiguous interval of timestamps adjacent to the
intervals its neighboring tilecols correspond to.  Then, tiles of the
same tilerow and consecutive tilecols should be stored consecutively
on disk most of the time.</p>
<p>Variable-length delta-compression of the data for a particular counter
within each tile should provide very substantial benefits in
responsiveness.</p>
<p>Data must be stored redundantly in two ways:
- the file of logged updates eventually becomes redundant with the
  data stored in the tiles;
- thinned-out data tiles contain selected timestamps from other tiles
  to facilitate queries that cover longer time intervals.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
