(10 minutes)</div><p>I was reading about Observablehq last night.  They’ve layered a
dependency and auto-recalculation system on top of JS, so that any
cell of your code is re-executed when its dependencies change, without
requiring you to explicitly reinvoke it.</p>
<p>I should probably dig into what Observable can do, or actually I
should work on some DSP code I’ve been procrastinating on, but instead
I am going to go off and natter about vaguely related stuff.</p>
<p>By executing the sequence of code in a cell, such a system can
discover which inputs it’s currently reading from and which outputs
it’s currently writing to, although both of these could change
depending on the values of those inputs.  Observable in particular
determines the outputs statically and doesn’t let different cells
write to the same variable.</p>
<p>Suppose in such a system you have a cell that computes</p>
<pre><code>r = (x**2 + y**2)**0.5
</code></pre>
<p>You can interpret this in the standard way, as a “statement”, which is
to say an instruction, which, when executed, reads single values from
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, do a computation, and write the single result to <code>r</code>.
Numpy extends this, following APL, by allowing <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, or both, to
contain <em>values</em> which are arrays of <em>numbers</em>.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x
array([-1.  , -0.75, -0.5 , -0.25,  0.  ,  0.25,  0.5 ,  0.75,  1.  ])
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
array([ 1.73205081,  1.85404962,  1.93649167,  1.98431348,  2.        ,
        1.98431348,  1.93649167,  1.85404962,  1.73205081])
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = (x**2 + y**2)**0.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; r
array([ 2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.])
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = (x**2 + y**2)**0.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; r
array([ 1.41421356,  1.25      ,  1.11803399,  1.03077641,  1.        ,
        1.03077641,  1.11803399,  1.25      ,  1.41421356])
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to allowing <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to either not vary or to vary
<em>together</em>, we can also have them vary <em>independently</em>, producing a
<em>matrix</em> of results for <code>r</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; y = x.reshape((9, 1))
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
array([[-1.  ],
       [-0.75],
       [-0.5 ],
       [-0.25],
       [ 0.  ],
       [ 0.25],
       [ 0.5 ],
       [ 0.75],
       [ 1.  ]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = (x**2 + y**2)**0.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; r
array([[ 1.41421356,  1.25      ,  1.11803399,  1.03077641,  1.        ,

<p>As I wrote in <a href="../notes/principled-apl.html">A principled rethinking of array languages like APL</a> and <a href="../notes/matrix-multiply.html">Index set inference or domain inference for programming with indexed families</a>, you could think
of the broadcasting rule for these simple elementwise operators as a
logical interpretation: <em>if</em> x = -0.75 <em>and</em> y = -1, <em>in that case</em> r
= 1.25; but <em>if</em> y = 0, <em>in that case</em> r = 0.75; and so on.  And given
a reactive observable dataflow transaction system like Observablehq,
you could in fact evaluate it that way — if you change the value of
<code>y</code> from -1 to 0 without changing <code>x</code>, <code>r</code> will react by changing its
value from 1.25 to 0.75.</p>
<h2>A FIR filter example</h2>
<p>How about a FIR filter?</p>
<pre><code>y = sum(w[i] * x[-i] for i in range(len(w)))
</code></pre>
<p>This is a valid Python statement, applying the time-domain FIR kernel
<code>w</code> to the last few values of the list or array <code>x</code>.  If you run it
every time you append a new value to <code>x</code>, it will put successive
samples of the FIR filter result into <code>y</code>.  You have to be careful to
not run it before <code>x</code> has enough values in it, and you probably want
to do something with the result in <code>y</code> before it gets overwritten by
the next execution, because the result is a function of a time-varying
state of the system.</p>
<p>Suppose instead that you want to compute the entire FIR-filtered
signal rather than just a point on it.  You can do such a computation
in Numpy in at least four different ways.  The way you would actually
use in practice is the <code>convolve</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>y = numpy.convolve(w, x, 'valid')
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately this doesn’t throw any light on how to solve the
problem; it just delegates it to a library function, which, as it
turns out, delegates to the <code>multiarray.correlate</code> function, which is
written in C and presumably does a nested loop.</p>
<p>The other two straightforward ways involve an interpreted loop in
Python (which is why you wouldn’t want to use them in practice) which
invokes an inner loop via a Numpy SIMD operation.  You could have the
implicit inner loop compute a single point of <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>y = [(w[::-1] * x[i:i+len(w)]).sum() for i in range(len(x) - len(w) + 1)]
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could have the implicit inner loop calculate the contribution
of a single sample of <code>x</code> to all the samples of <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>y = numpy.zeros(len(x) + len(w))
for i in range(len(x)):
    y[i:i+len(w)] += x[i] * w
y = y[len(w)-1:1-len(w)]
</code></pre>
<p>The fourth approach is to transform both <code>x</code> and <code>w</code> into the complex
Fourier domain, multiply the complex phasors there elementwise, and
transform back into the spatial domain.  This involves some subtle
issues of numerical precision, and it’s profoundly nonobvious, but for
large signal vectors, it is by far the fastest method.  Implicitly in
the above, <code>w</code> is not longer than <code>x</code>, and in that case it looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>wf = numpy.fft.fft(numpy.concatenate((w, numpy.zeros(len(x) - len(w)))))
y = numpy.fft.ifft(wf * numpy.fft.fft(x))[len(w)-1:]
</code></pre>
<p>How about in the “logical” view?  <code>w * x</code> is a perfectly reasonable
expression; if <code>w</code> has 5 possible values and <code>x</code> has 11, then it <code>w *
x</code> has 55 possibilities, reasonably represented as a matrix (the outer
product of <code>w</code> and <code>x</code>, considered as vectors).  It’s indexed by the
Cartesian product of <code>w</code>’s index set and <code>x</code>’s index set.  The <code>y</code>
computed above is just a sum over some of those values; the summation
introduces a dummy variable that ranges over the valid indices of <code>w</code>.</p>
<p>The conventional mathematical notation for this is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>yₙ</em> = Σ<em>ᵢwᵢxₙ₋ᵢ</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where the dummy variable <em>i</em> implicitly takes all the values that it
would be coherent for it to take.  This is somewhat ambiguous and
often disambiguated by contextual information: if <em>xᵢ</em> only exists
when <em>i</em> ≥ 0, for example, does <em>y</em>₀ exist, being simply <em>w</em>₀<em>x</em>₀?
And resolving that ambiguity is what the <code>'valid'</code> in the above Numpy
expression is for.</p>
<p>Typically we think of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> here as being indexed by
(discretized) time, but of course nothing in the math requires that;
for math, the time is just another meaningless variable.</p>
<p>In the “logical” view, this introduction of the dummy variable <em>i</em>
means that <em>any</em> value of <em>y</em> depends on <em>every</em> value of <em>w</em>.  In the
sort of ambient-indexing environment I was thinking of there, Σ
considers a multiplicity of possible worlds with different values of
<em>w</em>; in this case, we also want to use the <em>index</em> into <em>w</em> to reindex
<em>time itself</em> (ominous music with minor chords!) so we can access
values of <em>x</em> from other points in time.  A reasonable way to write
this in ASCII might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>y = sum(w.i, w * x[t = t-w.i])
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>sum</code> takes two arguments: the index to sum over and the
expression to evaluate in a possible world for <em>all</em> of the possible
values of the index.  <code>w.i</code> is the index set of <code>w</code>; as <code>sum</code>’s first
argument, it’s being used as <em>a reference to an index</em> that needs to
have its index set inspected and iterated over, while within the
expression, it’s being used as <em>a reference to a particular value of
that index</em>, a mere rvalue.  <code>x</code> is being indexed by the specification
<code>[t = t-w.i]</code>; this indexing creates another possible world in which
to evaluate <code>x</code>, in which the index <code>t</code> (which, perhaps, might be
<code>x.i</code> or a part of <code>x.i</code>) has a different value from its value in the
outer environment.  The expression <code>t-w.i</code> is evaluated in that outer
environment, taking the ambient value of <code>t</code> and subtracting the
current value of <code>w.i</code> from it.  The indexing expression hides the
outer ambient value of <code>t</code> from <code>x</code>, replacing it with the fake value.</p>
<p>This implies that <code>t</code> and <code>w.i</code> are of some types such that it makes
sense to subtract them; they are not, for example, merely categorical
or ordinal.  They could, however, be vectors of the same
dimensionality, such as 2-vectors, in which case the same expression
above serves for convolving images as well as time-series signals.</p>
<p>However, the fact that we’re iterating over all the possible values of
<code>w.i</code> means that it cannot be a <em>continuous</em> dimension, although its
values could be values of a continuous type.  It must be discrete so
that it can have a finite number of possible values!</p>
<p>The same ambiguity about out-of-range values is present.  If one of
the <code>x[t = t-w.i]</code> values happens to not exist, for a given ambient
value of <code>t</code>, does that mean the entire sum fails to exist, and thus
<code>y</code> has no value at that point?  Or does it merely mean we sum over a
smaller number of values?</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/dsp.html">Digital signal processing (DSP)</a> (60 notes)
