<p>A fox was hunting and had just caught a rabbit, and just after he
began eating his dinner, a wolf appeared behind him.</p>
<p>“Hello,” said the wolf, “I wanted to talk to you about economics.
Have you heard how specialization improves productivity and brings
prosperity to everyone?”</p>
<p>“No,” said the fox.</p>
<p>“If we each specialize in the area where we have the most comparative
advantage, we can get better at it and be more productive.  Shall we
try it?” said the wolf.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said the fox.</p>
<p>“I see you’re very good at hunting, so I think it would be great if
you specialized in hunting, and I’ll just specialize in allocating the
resources that result from your work,” said the wolf.  And so he ate
the rest of the rabbit the fox had caught.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the fox, “I’m not sure I like this kind of prosperity.
But I guess I can have a couple of specializations, right, as long as
they don’t conflict with yours?”</p>
<p>The wolf assented.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll specialize in urination.”</p>
<p>The next week, the wolf died of an exploded bladder.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/politics.html">Politics</a> (39 notes)
