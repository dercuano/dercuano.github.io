(1 minute)</div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dobU-b0_L1I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dobU-b0_L1I</a> explains that the Saleae
24MHz logic analyzer and its clones are basically a 48MHz Cypress
EZ-USB chip hooked up to the USB bus and some I/O pins, but <em>with the
program loaded each time you plug it in</em>.  The 8051 doesn’t have a
Flash or MRAM for its program.  So you can use it, for example, in the
way they have designed it, to stream parallel data over USB at its
maximum sampling rate.</p>
<p>Sigrok comes with an open-source firmware for the Cypress FX2 chips
called fx2lafw: FX2 logic analyzer firmware.</p>
<p>But you could also download a different program into the peripheral
when you plug it in, a program to make it do anything else at all, as
long as it’s plugged in.  You could use it to read sensors, control
GPIO pins, whatever.  And these chips have a <em>lot</em> of pins.</p>
<p>(He does in fact suggest using the Cypress breakout board for exactly
this.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
