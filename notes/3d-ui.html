(10 minutes)</div><p>One way you could simplify computing systems is by having fewer
redundant kinds of graphics.  Typical computing systems have many
different systems for windowing, drawing text, specifying fonts,
making translucent windows, representing vector graphics, drawing and
representing 3D graphics, zoomable graphics like maps, and doing text
layout, among other things.  For example, you might have VT-100
emulation, Xlib, PDF, Quartz, SVG, <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, HTML with the CSS box
model, PostScript, OpenGL, POVRay, H.264, MPEG-4, PNG, GIF, and JPEG,
all on the same machine.  Each typically has different tradeoffs
related to performance, flexibility, and visual quality, but most of
them just suck on all axes.</p>
<p>What if we had a graphics system that was both sufficiently expressive
to cover nearly all of these applications, but also sufficiently
performant to run in real time, while having a sufficiently simple
implementation as to be understandable by a single person?  Dan
Amelang’s Gezira and Nile are an influential effort in this direction
(for the aspect of graphics that involves rendering to pixels,
anyway), but they’re resolutely two-dimensional.</p>
<h2>Immediate-mode versus structured-mode</h2>
<p>In my view, immediate-mode graphics APIs like <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and
PostScript have more predictable performance and substantially simpler
code than structured-mode graphics systems like SVG.</p>
<h2>File formats</h2>
<p>File formats and graphics APIs are intimately related.  At the
simplest level, you can treat a file format as a “graphics API” in the
sense that you can draw stuff by piping a stream of bytes to a decoder
for that format; but the relationship goes the other direction too.</p>
<p>Of course, structured-mode graphics systems have this nailed down: all
they have to do is serialize the in-memory object graph using a
generic serialization system, and they’re done.  Direct-mode APIs are
more complicated.</p>
<p>A “recording” of a sequence of direct-mode drawing operations can be
“played back” by reinvoking the same operations in a new context, so a
drawing API is in some sense capable of being serialized as a file
format.  This is the idea behind, for example, the WMF “Windows
Metafile” vector format, which is just a serialized sequence of
Windows GDI drawing operations.  However, file formats and drawing
APIs have some divergent needs.</p>
<p>First, graphics file formats typically benefit from having some kind
of non-sequential access, for example for drawing particular areas,
particular layers, or particular pages.  Typical ways of selecting the
graphics of interest doing this include bounding boxes, quadtrees, k-d
trees, BSP-trees, and bitmaps of grids.</p>
<p>Second, programs using drawing APIs often want to make decisions about
what to draw based on conditions that hold in a particular case.  For
example, level-of-detail rendering is the name for a family of
techniques that render images in more detail when you are zoomed in to
see them, consuming more time, including things as simple as
approximating Bézier curves with a larger number of straight lines;
and of course programs often use bounding boxes to avoid spending time
drawing objects that are offscreen or invisible because of some other
clipping or occlusion.</p>
<p>You could imagine running such a program under some kind of
backtracking replay system that inspects it to see what environmental
conditions it’s testing, snapshotting it at each test and later
re-executing the conditionally-skipped parts, in order to derive the
first of these things from the second.  But that’s not going to be
universally applicable and anyway it’s kind of rocket science.</p>
<p>A less-transparent, lower-tech approach would involve executing
level-of-detail-conditional or bounding-box-conditional code in a
fashion like how IMGUI libraries handle the logic for menus and
windows that aren’t currently being displayed:</p>
<pre><code>if (bbox_visible(x0, y0, x1, y1)) {
    render_foo();
    render_bar();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; baz_count; i++) {
        render-baz(bazzes[i]);
    }
    end_bbox();
}
</code></pre>
<p>With this approach, interactive drawing can avoid rendering things
inside the given bounding box if it is outside the display bounds,
simply by returning false from <code>bbox_visible</code>, and metafile rendering
can always return true from <code>bbox_visible</code>, but nest the objects thus
constructed inside a bbox.  Optionally, metafile rendering code could
return false when you're inside a sufficiently small bbox, in order to
support programs that want to do infinite level-of-detail rendering.</p>
<p>(My entire premise here is that we should forget about 2D graphics and
just do 3D graphics, leaving 2D graphics as a special case where
you’re using an orthographic projection or something.  So really these
would be bounding volumes, not 2-D bounding boxes.)</p>
<p>Third, both direct-mode and structured-mode drawing systems are
capable of returning general information to the program that’s doing
the drawing, not just pointwise questions like “is this layer visible”
or “is this bounding volume visible”.  This is hazardous to file</p>
<h2>Tiny POVRay code</h2>
<p>POVRay is among the most flexible of these graphics systems.  For
example, <a href="https://mscharrer.net/povray/rays/">https://mscharrer.net/povray/rays/</a> is an animation of manta
rays swimming in a hazy ocean, made from these 464 fairly obfuscated
bytes of POV-Ray code, written by Jeff Reifel in 2008:</p>
<pre><code>#local
C=clock*pi;#macro
B(N,F)sphere{0F/7
1scale
1-pow(I.5)translate-I*F*x
rotate
y*N*90rotate-N*x*pow(5I)*10*sin(I*2-C*8+i)scale.2+x*.8translate-x}#end#local

rotate&lt;-90cos(i*3)*-45i*pi*36&gt;translate&lt;sin(i)+2*sin(2*i)5+cos(i)-2*cos(2*i)3*sin(3*i)+7&gt;*2rotate

i=i+pi/8;#end
light_source{&lt;0,60,99&gt;1spotlight}media{intervals
6scattering{2rgb&lt;.1.2,1&gt;/99}}
</code></pre>
<p>However, rendering the 300-frame looped animation on that page
involved casting 685 million rays and took fifty thousand CPU seconds,
two or three minutes per frame.  That’s only about 2 million rays per
frame or 14000 rays per CPU-second.</p>
<p>What if your drawing primitives were sufficiently powerful to allow
you to get graphical effects in such a tiny amount of code?  It’d be a
little bigger without the minification, but not that much.  My POVRay
is pretty rusty, but I think it is supposed to read as follows:</p>
<pre><code>#local C=clock*pi;

#macro B(N,F)
    sphere {
        0F/7
        1
        scale 1 - pow(I, .5)
            translate -I*F*x
                rotate y*N*90
                    rotate -N * x * pow(5I) * 10 * sin(I*2 - C*8 + i)
                        scale .2+x*.8
                            translate -x
    }
#end

#local i=C;

#while (i &lt; 2*pi+C)
    #local I=0;
    blob { 
        #while (I &lt; 1)
            B(1, 7)
            B(-1, 7)
            B(0, 3)
            #local I=I+.01;
        #end

        rotate &lt;-90, cos(i*3)*-45, i*pi*36&gt;
            translate &lt;
                       sin(i) + 2*sin(2*i),
                       5 + cos(i) -2*cos(2*i),
                       3*sin(3*i) + 7
                      &gt; * 2
                rotate x*37
                    pigment { slope y }
    }
    #local i=i+pi/8;
#end
light_source { &lt;0, 60, 99&gt; 1 spotlight }
media { intervals 6 scattering { 2 rgb&lt;.1, .2, 1&gt;/99 } }
</code></pre>
<p>That’s still only about 35 lines of code.  I mean, who knows how long
he took tweaking it.</p>
<p>One promising approach to things like this is to use some kind of
interval arithmetic or Monte Carlo rendering for level-of-detail
rendering: render as much as you can before the frame deadline and
display the result, and add more detail as long as the scene remains
static.  This is what Blender does, for example, with rotations of
large meshes.</p>
<h2>Computing performance</h2>
<p>One of the biggest levers we have available now to simplify things is
computing power to do things we couldn’t do in the past, just because
it was too expensive.  What’s the smallest amount of computing
horsepower we can expect?</p>
<p>A Raspberry Pi 2 costs US$40 right now and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/2wfadr/clustering_with_raspberry_pi_2/">can do about 250
megaflops</a>
on the CPU and 24 gigaflops on the GPUs, supposedly; a 64-Pi Version 1
Model B cluster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">hit 1.1 GFLOPS on
LINPACK</a>, or about 17
megaflops per Pi, and version 2 is supposedly 4 to 6 times as fast in
aggregate, thus 70 to 100 megaflops.  <a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/02/05/benchmarking-the-raspberry-pi-2/">Hackaday got 93
double-precision megaflops per core, and 1186 VAX MIPS, on the Pi
2</a>.
Also, it was able to shade 900 texture-mapped triangles <a href="http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/Raspberry%20Pi%20Benchmarks.htm#anchor18">at 40 fps,
although previous tests erroneously reported twice
that</a>
at about a megapixel of resolution.  That’s only 36000 triangles per
second.</p>
<p>Supposing that we can get 3 gigaflops out of a Pi 2 (geometric average
of the 400 megaflops from the Hackaday results and the 24 supposed
gigaflops from the GPUs) and we want 60 frames per second at 1
megapixel, we can spend up to about 50 floating-point operations per
displayed pixel.  Maybe I’m naïve, but that seems like it ought to be
enough to do pretty decent antialiased rendering of some textures.</p>
<h2>Derivative and interval approximations of imagery</h2>
<p>Suppose you calculate a sparse approximation of the gradient of the
screen image (the Jacobian, I guess) relative to the quantities in a
scene model.  Then, when you update the scene model slightly, you can
multiply the update through your sparse gradient matrix to get a
linear approximation of the change in the rendered image.</p>
<p>Calculating a gradient of the screen image relative to the scene model
sounds like rocket science, but apparently automatic differentiation
is now a well-established technique that can be applied to FORTRAN
scientific codes of substantial size.  In forward mode, it implies a
constant-factor slowdown.</p>
<p>Alternatively, instead of doing the rendering with points and
derivatives, you could do it with interval arithmetic, which allows
you to determine conservatively how big of a change in the input is
needed to create any change at all in the rendered scene.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
