(19 minutes)</div><p><a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2015004_cuneiform.pdf" title="The Cuneiform Tablets of 2015">Chifir</a> is inspirational.  It’s the first archival virtual machine
good enough to criticize.  You can implement the CPU in a page of C
(my version is 71 lines and took me 32 minutes to write), and then all
you need is screen emulation, which took me another 40 lines and 28
minutes.†</p>
<p>Archival virtual machines have applications beyond archival.
Independent implementations of the virtual machine defeat
Karger–Thompson attacks at the virtual machine level and potentially
the hardware level as well.  And a stable deterministic virtual
machine enables the publication of reference implementations of other
virtual machines and deterministic rebuilds of derived files, such as
compiler output, database indices, or raw pixels output from an image
codec.</p>
<p>Alas, Chifir is not good enough to actually use as a <em>general-purpose</em>
archival virtual machine, which of course is not its intended purpose.
Any of the following problems would by itself be a fatal flaw (for a
general-purpose archival virtual machine):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The specification does not include test cases, so there is no way
   to debug a candidate implementation, and in particular to easily
   disambiguate the natural-language specification of the instruction
   set.  In fact, as far as I can tell, not even the Smalltalk-72
   image described in the paper has been released.  This is important
   because when I added screen output to my implementation of Chifir,
   my first test program was a single-instruction infinite loop, which
   had a bug and also found a bug in my implementation of Chifir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, the instruction set contains unspecified behavior, including
   access to out-of-bounds memory addresses, execution of any of the
   4294967280 undefined opcodes, division by zero, the appearance of
   pixels that aren’t all-zeroes or all-ones, and arguably the
   rounding direction of division.  Unspecified behavior is a much
   worse problem for archival virtual machines than for the systems
   we’re more familiar with, because presumably the archaeologist
   implementing the virtual machine specification has no working
   implementation to compare to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The straightforward implementation of the instruction set using
   <code>for (;;) { ... switch(load(pc)) {...} }</code> is unavoidably going to
   be pretty slow, because the instructions only manipulate 32-bit
   quantities.  Getting reasonable performance would require a
   JIT-compiler implementation, which is complicated by the need to
   invalidate and recompile self-modifying code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input is blocking; it is impossible to read keyboard input, which
   is the only kind of input, without blocking.  That means that
   Chifir will, at any given time, be either unresponsive to the user
   or unable to execute any code until the user types a key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The instruction set has absurdly low code density, requiring 128
   bits per instruction.  This is a big problem for archival virtual
   machines because archival media are many orders of magnitude lower
   density than media customarily used for software interchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the specification specifies the bit order of the image
   when stored as individual bits (as in their proposed physical
   medium), it does not specify an image file format as a series of
   bytes.  In my implementation, I chose to represent the image in
   binary big-endian format, with the most significant byte first, but
   a different implementor might make a different choice, such as
   representing the image in a sequence of the ASCII digits “0” and
   “1”.  Such differences would produce unnecessary incompatibility at
   the file level between implementations, if not at the
   micro-engraved disc level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chifir has no provision for access to storage media; the only I/O
   is the screen and keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because Chifir has no clock, no timer interrupts, and no keyboard
   interrupts, there is no way within the Chifir system to regain
   control from an accidentally-executed infinite loop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it’s worth pointing out some things Chifir got right:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unlike Lorie’s UVC, the Chifir virtual machine has well-defined
   arbitrary implementation limits and overflow behavior, so it should
   be straightforward for all implementations to have the same
   arbitrary limits.  This will avoid incompatibilities where a
   virtual machine image works on one implementation of the virtual
   machine (perhaps the one used by an archivist) but fails for
   obscure reasons on another (perhaps the one written by an
   archaeologist.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like BF, and unlike most virtual machines, Chifir does succeed in
   being implementable in an afternoon, being a “fun afternoon’s
   hack”.  In fact, it vastly overshoots this goal: an afternoon is
   three to eight hours, depending on your definition, and it took me
   32 minutes to implement Chifir without a display and an hour to
   implement Chifir with a display.  (The COCOMO model used by David
   A. Wheeler’s ‘SLOCCount’ instead estimates it would take a week,
   but it’s usually wrong in such a way for such small programs.)
   Chifir could be about three times more complicated without
   overshooting the one-afternoon budget, especially if the
   implementor has known-good test programs to work with instead of
   having to concurrently write and debug their own.  Maybe a
   complexity budget of 512 lines of C, a bit under eight pages, would
   be a reasonable absolute maximum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chifir’s CPU lacks many edge-case-rich features present in other
   CPUs, which are common compatibility stumbling blocks.  For
   example, it doesn’t have floating point, flag bits, signed
   multiplication and division, different memory access modes,
   different instruction formats, different addressing modes, for that
   matter any general-purpose registers, memory protection, virtual
   memory, interrupts, different memory spaces (as in modified Harvard
   architectures like the Hack CPU).  Similarly, its I/O
   specifications are ruthlessly simple, leaving little room for
   compatibility problems.  It’s very likely that a straightforward
   implementation of the specification will be, if not absolutely
   right, at least almost right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In part because Chifir lacks such corner cases, nothing stops you
   from writing a multithreaded program or JIT compiler in Chifir
   code.</p>
</li>
</ol>

implementation because I wrote them separately.</p>
<h2>Some approaches to a possibly viable archival virtual machine design</h2>
<p>How should we design an archival virtual machine to make it easy to
write correct and sufficiently fast emulators for existing systems we
want to preserve?</p>
<h3>Use a register-based instruction set</h3>
<p>Register virtual machines are faster than stack machines or belt
machines (like the Mill) when all three are implemented in a
straightforward way; typically the benefit is about a factor of 2.
Register virtual machines have a small instruction density penalty,
and their assembly code doesn’t factor as nicely as stack machines’
and isn’t as easy to generate as stack machines’.  But I find it
easier to write by hand, and in any case, reasonable register
allocation can be fairly simple.</p>
<p>Register virtual machines can also, in theory, eliminate the need for
jump instructions if the PC is as accessible as any other register,
though the overhead on this mechanism is a bit high to use it as a
calling mechanism as well.</p>
<p>Look to Thumb (and the curiously similar Cray-1 instruction set) for
code density tricks.</p>
<p>Other things we’ve considered include: MOV machines
(“transport-triggered architectures”) like my “dontmove”; stack
machines like the MuP21; and RTL designs where the only operation was
producing new bitvectors from the NAND of slices of existing
bitvectors.</p>
<h3>Focus the instruction set design on video with SIMD instructions</h3>
<p>The most performance-critical part of computers with graphical
displays has always been the graphical display.  This was true in 1963
when Ivan Sutherland wrote SKETCHPAD; it was true in 1974 when the
Alto implemented bitblt in microcode; it was true in 1980 when
6502-based microcomputers competed to provide more hardware sprites on
the display at once; it was true in 1996 when Andy Glew designed MMX
for the Pentium MMX; it’s true today in 2018 when we’re using GPUs
instead of CPUs to mine Ethereum, crack passwords, and train neural
nets.</p>
<p>If updating the screen is slow, everything will feel slow.  If
updating the screen is fast, probably the other parts of the system’s
code will be fast enough too.</p>
<p>So probably wide SIMD registers, like SSE, NEON, or AVX, are a good
model to follow.  Unlike SSE (but like GPUs) it’s probably better to
have <em>only</em> wide SIMD registers.  You can always ignore the rest of
the vector if you only care about a scalar operation!</p>
<p>GCC offers a particularly simple and reasonably effective way to apply
such facilities, documented in its manual in the section “Using Vector
Instructions through Built-in Functions”.  Briefly, it provides only
“vertical” operations (those that operate on corresponding vector
items), except that you can subscript vector values to fetch
individual items, you can broadcast scalars across vectors, and
there’s a <code>__builtin_shuffle</code> function which can rearrange vector
items.  And of course each operation can operate on any vector type.
(Heterogeneous operations, e.g. 4 floats with 4 uint32s, are not
supported.)  This is mupch simpler than the irregular zoo of 600+
vector instructions provided by Intel, and if it’s at times somewhat
less efficient, it’s still dramatically more efficient than just
writing scalar code.</p>
<p>(In C++, GCC also offers <code>?:</code>, <code>!</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, and <code>||</code> for these vector
values.)</p>
<p>SIMD instructions provide the opportunity for a naïve for-switch loop
to get reasonable performance, because each instruction is doing
enough work to pay for the heavy interpretation overhead.  This can
also helps with the cost of bounds-checking, at least if you don’t
have scatter-gather — a bounds-check every 16 or 32 bytes is less
costly than a bounds-check every byte.</p>
<p>Originally I thought you could get by with only 32-bit unsigned math,
like Chifir, and that might actually be true.  But then I got a tiny
bit of experience writing SSE code, and it sure is nice when you can
get 16 byte additions in an instruction instead of 4.</p>
<p>(However, I don’t think the saturating arithmetic mode is worth it.)</p>
<h3>Or use vector instructions as an alternative to SIMD</h3>
<p>“Vector instructions” here is referring to Cray-style or NEC-SX-style
vector instructions.  I don’t think this is a good idea for archival
because it’s far too easy for implementation optimizations to leak
through to the visible semantics, but see <a href="../notes/vector-vm.html">A simple virtual machine for vector math?</a> for more
details.</p>
<h3>Forget about floating point</h3>
<p>Floating-point math is profoundly important and very tempting to
support, but even with near-universal adherence to the IEEE-754
standard, which requires that the basic arithmetic operations produce
results accurate to within half an ulp (which means that all
conforming implementations will produce bit-identical results), it’s
impossible to argue that floating point is easy to get right.  Even in
the last few years, the introduction of the FMA facility in Intel
processors has introduced divergence from bit-identical results in
expressions as simple as <code>a+b*c</code>, which may produce results differing
by an ulp depending on whether your compiler compiles it to use FMA or
not.</p>
<p>Aside from that, getting gradual underflow, rounding modes, and NaN
handling right requires lots of special cases, and it is often omitted
for the sake of performance.</p>
<h3>Don’t have unspecified behavior</h3>
<p>This means no undefined instructions, no undefined video results, no
undefined results of out-of-bounds memory, no race conditions, nothing.</p>
<h3>Have nonblocking I/O</h3>
<p>It’s absolutely essential to be able to run code while periodically
checking whether the user has provided any input.  It may not be
necessary to make the input interrupt-driven — modern machines are
fast enough to poll a keyboard at 100Hz without producing undue CPU
load, even in emulation.  A “hardware” input event ring buffer is
probably the right mechanism here.</p>
<h3>Have a timer interrupt</h3>
<p>Without a timer interrupt, you can’t do preemptive multitasking, and
without either a timer interrupt or a pollable system clock, you can’t
do animation at a correct speed, because you have no way to tell what
speed you’re doing it at.  The timer interrupt should be able to run
at a high enough frequency that you can poll the keyboard at over
100Hz.  A fixed 1000Hz is probably fine, but it’s possible that it may
need to be configurable by the program, like the Unix alarm(2) system
call or JS's <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code>.</p>
<p>This thought is scary because it inevitably introduces nondeterminism
into the system, because it potentially provides side-channel
communication into the virtual machine, and because bugs in interrupt
handlers are hard to debug.  But the cost of not having it is just too
high.</p>
<p>(With respect to nondeterminism — consider possible implementations in
which timer interrupts are handled at the end of each instruction, at
the end of each basic block, and at backward jumps or calls.  How
likely is it that a program that is tested and working in one of the
later cases will turn out to have previously undetected heisenbugs
when run on a simulator with more possible interruption points?)</p>
<p>For non-interactive tasks or those in which determinism is paramount,
this facility can be disabled.</p>
<p>As an alternative sufficient for animation timing, a purely
deterministic facility could freeze the virtual machine’s execution
until a given timestamp had passed, but provide no way for the program
to determine the current timestamp.  (Waiting for a time in the past
would simply return immediately.)  Since the program cannot execute
any instructions while frozen, it cannot observe whether any time has
passed or not.  However, this doesn’t enable you to implement a
preemptively multitasking operating system.</p>
<h3>Write a comprehensive set of test cases</h3>
<p>You don’t need any testing hooks in the virtual machine definition for
this, just a breakpoint facility and the ability to look at memory
when a breakpoint is hit, which are entirely external to the VM as
seen by the program — they are a <em>deus ex machina</em> from the program’s
point of view.</p>
<p>For math operations with up to 32 bits of input, such as 16-bit binary
operations and 32-bit unary operations, there’s no reason not to
exhaustively test them.</p>
<h3>Specify a file format</h3>
<p>That means a concrete representation as a sequence of 8-bit bytes, not
just glyphs engraved on a disk.  Provide the test cases in this
format.</p>
<h3>Don’t have memory protection</h3>
<p>Memory protection is probably not worth the complexity it would add to
the virtual machine.</p>
<h3>Minimal set of ALU operations</h3>
<p>BF only provides increment and decrement ALU operations, which is
insufficient.  Chifir provides <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>×</code>, <code>÷</code> (presumably floor
division), modulo, <code>&lt;</code>, and NAND.  C provides <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>
(usually floor division), <code>%</code>, <code>?:</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>,
<code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, and unary <code>-</code>.  Golang adds
abjunction, <code>&amp;^</code>, which is also in AVX2, PDP-10, and (IIRC) ARM; Java adds
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, unsigned right shift, as a separate operation, while in C the
choice between logical and arithmetic right shift is based on the
declared data type.  The F18A offers <code>2*</code>, <code>2/</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>~</code> (spelled
<code>-</code>), <code>&amp;</code>, <code>^</code>, and <code>+*</code>, which executes an 18-bit multiply if you run
it 18 times.  Various kinds of vector instruction sets (for example,
SSE and APL) also offer min and max; many languages support
exponentiation; and lerp, a sort of continuous generalization of <code>?:</code>,
is often offered as a fundamental operation.  I saw somewhere an
instruction set whose <code>&gt;</code> operation was actually unary; it was just
<code>x &gt; 0 ? x : 0</code>, so applying it to the result of a subtraction would give
you a nonzero value precisely when the result had been positive.  CPU
instruction sets traditionally have rotation instructions as well as
shift instructions, but I find them useful very rarely.</p>
<p>You also have really out-there stuff like CLMUL, AES, CRC32, and the
like, the abominable children of the dark-silicon age.</p>
<p>So how much do you really need?  For an archival virtual machine,
probably the F18A’s seven operations (three of them unary) is too
minimal, since it means that (in the absence of a sufficiently smart
compiler, which is not an afternoon hack) a CPU or FPGA with hardware
multipliers must emulate the very common operation of multiplication
through an arduous sequence of simulated instructions, and similarly
for barrel shifters and multi-bit shifts.  On the other hand, the cost
of emulating <code>&gt;</code> given <code>&lt;</code> is generally nil, and the cost of emulating
<code>&gt;=</code> given <code>&lt;</code> is small.  Where it comes to bitwise operations,
abjunction (with constants) or NAND alone is sufficient to produce all
the others, but producing XOR with either of these alone requires five
operations, which seems excessive (thus the F18A’s three bitwise
operations).</p>
<p>I suggest the following set:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unsigned binary integer <code>+</code>.</li>
<li>Two’s-complement unary integer <code>-</code>.</li>
<li>Unsigned integer <code>*</code>, producing a double-width result.</li>
<li>Unsigned integer divmod, taking a double-width dividend but
   producing two single-width results.</li>
<li>Unsigned integer <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> with arbitrary shifts.</li>
<li>Signed integer <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Bitwise <code>&amp;</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>|</code>, and <code>~</code>.  (See <a href="../notes/bitwise-sets.html">Performance properties of sets of bitwise operations</a> for the
   exploration of this.)</li>
<li>Two’s-complement signed integer max, i.e. λ(x, y).(x &gt; y ? x : y).</li>
<li><code>==</code>.</li>
<li>The ternary operator <code>?:</code>, which is particularly important with
    vector registers, since you can’t implement it the traditional way
    using control flow.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is 14 operations, considerably more than the F18A’s 7 but
substantially less than C’s 19; they are chosen with the intention
that the missing 7 operations, plus many other useful ones, can be
constructed in two operations:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>a - b</code> = <code>a + -b</code></li>
<li><code>a &gt; b</code> = <code>max(0, a - b)</code></li>
<li><code>a &lt; b</code> = <code>max(0, b - a)</code></li>
<li><code>a &gt;= b</code> = <code>0 == max(0, b - a)</code></li>
<li><code>a &lt;= b</code> = <code>0 == max(0, a - b)</code></li>
<li><code>a &amp;^ b</code> = <code>a &amp; ~b (or a ^ (a &amp; b))</code></li>
<li><code>a NAND b</code> = <code>~(a &amp; b)</code></li>
<li><code>a NOR b</code> = <code>~(a | b)</code></li>
<li><code>a != b</code> = <code>0 == (a == b)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s arguable that maybe we shouldn't include both <code>~</code> and unary <code>-</code>,
since you can get from one to the other with a simple +1 or -1.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
