(1 minute)</div><p>Optimization-based painting software are going to be a big deal.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is software that generates an image according to
some kind of model of the image-forming process, controlled by a
sketch made by the user.  Perhaps at a reduced pixel count, or reduced
coloring, or with added noise due to mouse, or whatever.</p>
<p>Perhaps the model involves lines, or wavelets, or gradients, or
boundaries between areas, or three-dimensional objects, or people, or
animals, or convolutional neural networks, or whatever.  It’s
relatively straightforward to generate an image from such a model, and
then you can compare the image to the image the user has drawn, using
a metric that takes into account the kinds of errors people don’t
intend, in order to infer a highly probable underlying model — if not
the most probable one given the whole set of possible models, which is
probably infeasible to compute, at least a reasonably probable one.
Then, given this underlying model, you can generate a high-fidelity
image of what the user intended.</p>
<p>But that’s just the beginning, because then you can modify the image
in order to correct the model, you can select among a variety of
images representing different models, and you can select among many
images that potentially represent the same model.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
