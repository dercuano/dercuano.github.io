(6 minutes)</div><p>From the WP article about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Bravo">Castle Bravo</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a theoretical error made by designers... They considered only the
lithium-6 isotope in the lithium deuteride secondary to be reactive;
the lithium-7 isotope, accounting for 60% of the lithium content,
was assumed to be inert. ... It was assumed that the lithium-7 would
absorb one neutron, producing lithium-8 which decays (via
beryllium-8) to a pair of alpha particles on a timescale of
seconds—vastly longer than the timescale of nuclear
detonation. However, when lithium-7 is bombarded with energetic
neutrons, rather than simply absorbing a neutron, it captures the
neutron and decays almost instantly into an alpha particle, a
tritium nucleus, and another neutron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result was an extra 10 megatons of yield (4.2e16 joules, i.e. 42
petajoules) from the 10.7 tonnes of the device, most of which was
presumably the lithium; this is about 6 or 7 petajoules per kg.</p>
<p>This reaction is remarkably similar to the “energy amplification”
reaction used in thorium reactors: a neutron entering a mass of
lithium-7 will stimulate a decay, which emits another neutron, which
is either lost or stimulates another decay, and so on.  We can infer
that this does not produce a self-sustaining chain reaction because
natural lithium still contains 92.5% lithium-7, and there is
apparently no critical mass of lithium which results in a uranium-like
or plutonium-like chain reaction.</p>
<p>(Presumably this is because in fact the decay to two helium nuclei via
⁸Be mentioned above does happen even at high energies and consumes
some or most of the neutrons.  This was in fact the first artificial
“splitting of the atom”, carried out by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932
with a 700kV tube to accelerate protons — the cyclotron, necessary to
reach energies per charge higher than your voltage, was only invented
that same year in Berkeley.)</p>
<p>Lithium, however, is more appealing than thorium for a variety of
reasons, occurs at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust">17 ppm in the crust, compared to thorium’s 6
ppm</a>, and there is an existing industry extracting over half a
million tonnes of it from the crust per year, while thorium only has a
few uses and is somewhat dangerous to refine because of its natural
radioactivity.  Thorium is <a href="http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/thorium/mcs-2016-thori.pdf">imported into the US at a few tens of
tonnes per year, and costs around US$100 per kilogram</a>, while
lithium <a href="http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/mcs-2016-lithi.pdf">is imported at a rate of some 3000 tonnes per year and costs
around US$6000 per tonne</a>, or US$6 per kilogram.</p>
<p>Lithium-6 also produces tritium when irradiated with a neutron,
yielding 4.8 MeV (about 40 times less than the energy of an actinide
fission), which works out to 77 TJ/kg, about 1% of the energy density
inferred above for the Castle Bravo excess energy.</p>
<p>(The <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/lithium.aspx">World Nuclear Association says</a> that lithium-7 constitutes
92.5% of natural lithium and has a very low neutron cross section of
0.045 barns, and that on proton bombardment it fissions to 2He-4
yielding 17 MeV.)</p>
<p>US$6/kg and 6 PJ/kg conveniently give a fuel cost of US$1/PJ.  By
comparison, a common wholesale price for electrical energy is
US$60/MWh (though this fluctuates minute by minute and goes negative
most nights).  This electrical price works out to US$16.67 per
gigajoule, and thus US$16'666'667 per petajoule, some three million
times the price of the lithium fast fission energy.  Even the lower
energy of the ⁶Li decay would be some thirty thousand times cheaper
than grid power.</p>
<p>The tritium produced also decays energetically with a half-life of
some 12 years; while this is too slow to be useful for a nuclear
weapon, it could be useful for a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>There’s still an engineering question about how difficult it is to
generate the neutrons to initiate the reaction; fusing lithium
deuteride to generate the neutrons is clearly not an option in most
cases, and you need to take into account the energy consumed by the
particle accelerator.  I suspect that the slow fission reaction by way
of ⁸Be mentioned above would also work, in which case the neutrons
need not be energetic.  Quite likely the usual approach of neutron
spallation from a mercury target impacted by a proton beam would be
adequate.</p>
<p>Lithium is particularly troublesome here because of its small
cross-section — while ²³⁸U has a thermal neutron capture cross-section
of about 2 barns, I’m guessing both ⁶Li and ⁷Li have capture and
fission cross-sections in the neighborhood of the capture cross
section of hydrogen (0.2 barns), deuterium (0.0003 barns), or carbon
(0.002 barns), which are another two to four orders of magnitude lower
for fast neutrons.  This means you might need 10 or 100 or 1000 times
as much thickness of lithium absorbing the neutrons as you would for
an actinide, or, alternatively, 10 or 100 or 1000 times as many
neutrons.</p>
<p>The fission produces helium, a gas, and tritium, which can be gaseous
if it reacts with other tritium rather than something else in the
area; this suggests that the fuel should be kept liquid, perhaps as a
molten salt, to allow the gas to bubble out instead of building up
inside a solid.</p>
<p>Given the uniquely prominent position of ⁷Li/⁸Be fission in the
history of nuclear physics research, it is inconceivable that this
idea is original, so there is probably an obvious, well-known reason
why it doesn’t work; Szilárd surely tried it in the early 1930s, ten
years before he and Fermi got a successful chain reaction going in
uranium in 1942, but of course Szilárd didn’t have access to modern
fast electronics or even a cyclotron at the time.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/materials.html">Materials</a> (112 notes)
