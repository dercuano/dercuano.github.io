<p>The “method of finite differences” as used in the Difference Engine is
closely related to, but slightly different from, Newton’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divided_differences">method of
divided differences</a> (used, for example, for polynomial
interpolation or for boundary-value problems in ordinary differential
equations) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method">finite difference method</a> used in the solution
of ODEs and PDEs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine#Method_of_differences">Wikipedia page on the Difference Engine explains</a> how to
calculate the initial values, but I am skeptical of its explanation.
However, it cites <a href="http://ed-thelen.org/bab/bab-intro.html">Nathan Myhrvold’s instructions for setting up the
machine</a>, which we can suppose have been tested on the one he had
built.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Astronomische_Nachrichten/Volume_46/On_Mr._Babbage's_new_machine_for_calculating_and_printing_mathematical_and_astronomical_tables">F. Baily’s 1823 comments on the Difference Engine</a> we
find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2º. Tables of Square Numbers. The squares of all numbers, as far as
1000, were a long time ago published … In computing a table of this
kind by the machine, even if extended to the most remote point that
could be desired, the whole of the mental labour would be saved: and
when the numbers 1, 1, 2 are once placed in it, it will continue to
produce all the square numbers in succession without
interruption. This is, in fact, one of those tables which the engine
already made is capable of computing, as far as its limited number
of wheels will admit.</p>
<p>3º. Tables of Cube Numbers. Tables of this kind have likewise been
already computed… In computing such a table by the machine, the
whole of the mental labour would be in this case also saved: since
it would be merely necessary to place in the machine the numbers 1,
7, 6, 6; and it would then produce in succession all the cube
numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The table of cubes begins 1, 8, 27, 64, 125; its first differences are
7, 19, 37, 61…, and its second differences are thus 12, 18, 24…, its
third differences 6, 6…, and its fourth differences merely a sequence
of zeroes, since the third-order approximation is actually precisely
correct.  The first item of each of these sequences gives the (1, 7,
6, 6) setup described in Baily’s article.</p>
<p>XXX no it doesn’t; 6 is the difference between 1 and 7, so I think Baily
actually took into account the half-cycle offset I claim below that he
didn’t take into account; his numbers give the correct answer as shown
at the end.</p>
<p>However, to update this state (1, 7, 6, 6) to its successor state (8,
13, 12, 6) without any extra storage, we must work strictly from left
to right, because the previous value of each number (except the 1, in
the lowest-order register, T) is needed to update the next-lower-order
term, before being itself updated (except the second 6, in the
highest-order register, Δ³).  So we must proceed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>| T | Δ¹ | Δ² | Δ³ |
| 1 |  7 |  6 |  6 |
| 8 |  7 |  6 |  6 |
| 8 | 13 |  6 |  6 |
| 8 | 13 | 12 |  6 |
</code></pre>
<p>XXX note that 13 is wrong because it should be 19</p>
<p>However, at least in the “Difference Engine No. 2” design Babbage
developed between 1846 and 1849 (23–26 years after Baily’s letter),
the calculations are not performed in this serial fashion.  <a href="http://ed-thelen.org/bab/bab_tech_calc.html#Odd">As
explained in Swade’s analysis</a>, instead a set of four parallel
additions is carried out, then a set of three parallel additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the sequence of additions as executed by the engine does
not proceed in a stepwise way from right to left as one might expect
from the manual method. One complete calculating cycle consists of
two symmetrical half-cycles. During the first half-cycle the number
values on the odd-numbered axes are simultaneously added to those of
the even-numbered axes to the immediate left i.e. axes 1 [Δ⁷], 3
[Δ⁵], 5 [Δ³], 7 [Δ¹] are added to 2 [Δ⁶], 4 [Δ⁴], 6 [Δ²],and 8 [T]
respectively. Similarly, during the second half-cycle all the
even-numbered axes are simultaneously added to the odd-numbered axes
again to the immediate left. Provided this is taken account of when
setting up at the start of a run by offsetting the initial values on
alternate axes by a half-cycle, the end result is the same i.e. each
full calculating cycle results in a new tabular value which is the
cumulative sum of the number of active differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in fact, if we want to compute a table of cubes, to get 8 as our
second cube, we do indeed need to set Δ¹ (column 7 on the machine) to
7, as Baily says.  And then, having been used, it is incremented by Δ²
(column 6 on the machine) in the second half-cycle — but that Δ² had
previously been incremented by Δ³ in the first half-cycle.  So the
correct initial state we would need is not Baily’s (1, 7, 6, 6) but
(1, 7, 0, 6), proceeding as follows:</p>
<pre><code>| T | Δ¹ | Δ² | Δ³ |
| 1 |  7 |  0 |  6 |
| 8 |  7 |  6 |  6 |
| 8 | 13 |  6 |  6 |
</code></pre>
<p>XXX this is the wrong answer.  If we start from Baily’s setup we get the
right answer:</p>
<pre><code>|   T | Δ¹ | Δ² | Δ³ |
|   1 |  7 |  6 |  6 |
|   8 |  7 | 12 |  6 |
|   8 | 19 | 12 |  6 |
|  27 | 19 | 18 |  6 |
|  27 | 37 | 18 |  6 |
|  64 | 37 | 24 |  6 |
|  64 | 61 | 24 |  6 |
| 125 | 61 | 30 |  6 |
