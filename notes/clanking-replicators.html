(3 minutes)</div><p>So I’ve come to the conclusion that the most significant thing to
focus on right now is getting clanking replicators up and running:
programmable machines based on bulk-material-processing technology
(i.e. the way all machines except for a few experimental STM and AFM
setups in research labs operate) that can reproduce themselves much
faster than the economic growth rate, say in hours to weeks rather
than decades.</p>
<p>I think this is possible now, there’s a sort of “arms race” underway
to get it to happen, and whoever succeeds will have a massive economic
advantage, comparable to but larger than the discontinuity in the
shift from hunter-gatherer and pastoral-nomad lifestyles to
agriculture.</p>
<p>Freitas is the one who’s written the most about this in the past.
<a href="https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~sipper/selfrep/">Sipper also has a page on the
issue</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve just downloaded Freitas and Merkle’s 2004 book KSRM, which seems
to be the latest survey of the space; it probably inspired Adrian
Bowyer to start RepRap.  Freitas in particular seems focused on
molecular nanotechnology now, but it seems likely that MNT is
somedistance further down the road.</p>
<p>The race is unremarked and can be carried out at small scale and
without exotic materials or, probably, much special resources.  Once a
clanking replicator is created, exponential growth should be rapid.</p>
<p>Many words are available from fiction and more careful speculation for
such a project: Autofacs, Second Variety, Screamers, Berserkers,
Auxons, and Replicators.
<a href="http://discovermagazine.com/1995/oct/robotbuildthysel569">Auxon</a> is a
positive term (from <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0895717795000719">Lackner and Wendt’s 1995
proposal</a>),
and
<a href="https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1955-11/Galaxy_1955_11#page/n71/mode/2up">Autofac</a>
is sort of neutral; the others are all nightmares.</p>
<p>I have a lot of reading to do now.</p>
<h2>Mechanical vs. electronic computation</h2>
<p>I think mechanical control systems might be adequate, and they won’t
require the exotic high-purity materials that semiconductor devices
do.  Freitas I guess didn’t think that was going to be a problem in
1980.</p>
<p>However, this requires a mechanical system capable of universal
computation.  <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS396x/Computing/MechComp.pdf" title="Mechanical computation: its Computational Complexity...">Reif wrote a survey chapter in 2008 on mechanical
computation</a>  which
seems to suggest that nobody has built a mechanical universal computer
yet.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wvegter.hivemind.net/abacus/CyberHeroes/Herzstark.htm">Curta I
calculator</a>
had only 571 parts, while Vaucanson’s swan (according to Freitas) had
over 1000.  I think Calculus Vaporis could probably be implemented
with a similar parts count using lookup tables for combinational
logic.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/economics.html">Economics</a> (33 notes)
