<p>Suppose we want a really compact format for representing computer
programs.  Historically speaking, stack-based representations tend to
be the most compact, even though not all operands can be implicit;
typically you have a ratio of about one stack manipulation to one
computational operation.  I thought maybe we could do better, with a
construction like the Mill’s Belt, and so I did the quick rough
analysis below to see what gains were likely; it turns out that you
can roughly match 5-bit stack code with a variable-bit-length operand
coding, but not clearly beat it.</p>
<p>The idea is that instead of referring to input values implicitly by
their position on the stack, you refer to them by how long ago they
were produced.  At a given point in code with no control-flow join
points (jump destinations that can be reached by more than one jump or
by non-jumping control flow) each non-constant value was either
provided as an input at entry, produced at a single lag into the past.
Consider, for example, this piece of assembly code, which copies a
byte from stdin to stdout under Linux:</p>
<pre><code>_start: mov $__NR_read, %eax        # literal constant  #0
        mov $stdin, %ebx            # literal constant  #1
        mov %esp, %ecx              # use input #-1
        mov $1, %edx                # literal constant  #2
        int $0x80                   # operation: system call with four args #3
                                    # inputs are #0, #1, #-1, and #2
                                    #            (.-3, .-2, .-4, and .-1)
        test %eax, %eax             # result of operation #5 (.-1) #4
        jz exit                     # jump conditional on result of #4 (.-1)
        mov $__NR_write, %eax       # literal constant  #5
        mov $stdout, %ebx           # #6
        mov %esp, %ecx              # input #-1
        mov $1, %edx                # #7
        int $0x80                   # #8 (using #5 (.-3), #6 (.-2), #-1 (.-9), #7 (.-1))
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have ten references to non-constant values that are inputs to
four subsequent operations (two system calls, a comparison, and a
conditional jump).  Some of the non-constant values are the result of
a previous operation; others are references to the value of %esp at
the entry to this code, some time in the past; and others are
references to previously introduced constant values.  The offsets into
the past at which these references occur are distributed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>.-1 4
.-2 2
.-3 2
.-4 1
.-9 1

<p>Here’s another example, a complete subroutine on amd64:</p>

  26 0006 48C1EB20      shrq    $32, %rbx      # &gt;&gt; with literal constant and #0 (.-2)     #2
  27 000a 83C301        addl    $1, %ebx       # + with literal constant and #2 (.-1)      #3

<p>Here we see the following distribution of offsets into the past for
value references:</p>
<pre><code>.-1 5
.-2 2
.-5 1
.-8 1
.-9 1
</code></pre>
<p>If we sum both tables, we get this:</p>
<pre><code>.-1 9
.-2 4
.-3 2
.-4 1
.-5 1
.-8 1
.-9 2
total 20
</code></pre>
<p>So, what probability distribution are these spans drawn from?</p>
<p>This gives a first impression that the probability of a reference
going N steps back declines exponentially in N, which is to say, the
span is geometrically distributed.  The optimal encoding for
geometrically encoded data is Golomb coding, which reduces to unary
coding in the case where the exponential parameter is 2, which is
pretty much what it is here.</p>
<p>If we encode those 20 spans in unary, they consume (+ 9 (* 2 4) (* 3
2) 4 5 8 9 9) = 58 bits, an average of 2.9 bits per operand; this is
pretty close to the same density we would get on MuP21 or GreenArrays
stack code with its 5-bit operations.  This leads me to believe that
5-bit stack operations are already quite close to the optimal density
for operand encoding.</p>
<p>(If we assume that the real distribution is exactly the one the
encoding is optimized for, we would get exactly 2 bits per operand
on average.  But it’s probably not.)</p>
<p>However, bytecode normally uses a whole byte per operation.  To get
such slightly-under-3-bits-per-operand density in stack code, you
definitely need your stack manipulation operations to occupy less than
8 bits, because that will get you about 4 bits per operand.</p>
<p>(You would have to elaborate the model a bit to handle merging
control-flow, such as at the tops of loops and after conditionals, and
to handle functions, and I don’t think this will be difficult, but the
likely gains are not large enough to motivate me.)</p>
<p>A possible way to rescue this: suppose that for two-operand
instructions, one of the operands is <em>always</em> implicitly the previous
result, and you use a separate one-operand “belt manipulation” copy
instruction in the rare cases where that isn’t what you want.  If
these copy instructions are uncommon enough, this could get your
average well below the 5.8 bits of operands per computational
instruction implied by the above, maybe down to 3 or below.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (123 notes)
