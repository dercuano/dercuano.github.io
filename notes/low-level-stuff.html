<p>But I don't think that the low-level stuff is frozen in time; it
changes too.  There was a time when a better C compiler would only
help the few people working on Unix at Bell Labs, but today it can
improve performance (or security, or debuggability, or whatever) for
all of that high-level stuff built on top of C.  So the people working
on high-level stuff kind of act as a multiplier for the people working
on low-level stuff.  Which is why Intel and AMD and ARM etc. can spend
as much effort as they do designing CPUs.</p>
<h2>More and More People Work at the Low Level</h2>
<p>I wonder how the amount of effort that goes into making CPUs and other
electronics for computers has changed over the years.  Intel alone has
<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/intel.html" title="Intel company profile">something like 100 000 employees</a>, and essentially all of them
is focused on the lowest levels of computers: processors, motherboard
chipsets, flash memory, and so on.  <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/AboutAMD/0,,51_52_484,00.html" title="AMD at a Glance">AMD has another 16 500
employees</a>, and other top semiconductor companies (Toshiba,
STMicroelectonics, TI, Samsung Electronics, Freescale (24000),
Infineon, Sanmina-SCI, and so on) add several hundred thousand more
people.</p>
<p>Back in 2000, the <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/news/design/columns/tool_talk/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=17406429">EE Times reported</a> that the "embedded software
tools market" was US$670 million (estimated at US$500 per seat) and
the electronic design automation market was four times that, or US$2.7
billion (estimated at US$100 000 per seat).  More recently <a href="http://www.ciol.com/Semicon/SemiSpeak/Interviews/EDA-healthy-and-growing-in-India/16608107122/0/">CIOL
reported almost twice that size</a>, and <a href="http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800362966_480100_NT_c8b580ac.HTM" title="Is Today's EDA World Too Provincial?, 2005-04-01, by Richard Goering">EE Times Asia reported
192 000 total semiconductor design seats in 2004</a>, although
the article was published on April Fool's Day, 2005, plus 537 000 FPGA
and PCB design seats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A "seat count" report issued by Gartner Dataquest in January
showed that there were only about 56,000 ASIC design seats in
2004, a number that's expected to decline to 39,000 by 2008. The
total number of semiconductor design seats was pegged at 192,000
for 2004, with a CAGR of just 1.3 percent until 2008.</p>
<p>In contrast, the report cited 537,000 FPGA and PCB design seats in
2004, growing at a 2.9 percent CAGR. Granted FPGA and PCB
designers don't spend as much money as IC designers, but there are
a lot more of them. And there are tough problems that could prove
very lucrative for vendors that have solutions. For example, FPGA
designers need to look at power and signal integrity, and PCB
designers are having a hard time getting IC packages to work on
boards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems that the number of people working at the very lowest
levels --- the hardware levels --- has been gradually increasing over
the last several years, and has already reached a really remarkable
number.</p>
<h2>Changing the Low Level is Getting Easier</h2>
<p>To write software for CP/M, you would write it in 8080 assembly, or
maybe Z80 or 8085 assembly if you were willing to limit your userbase,
and used the BIOS and BDOS functions for I/O and file management.  You
could use C or FORTH, but they had big drawbacks.  Porting software in
8080 assembly even to MS-DOS on an 8086 was a pain, and porting it to
a 68000 basically required rewriting it, or buying or writing a slow
8080 emulator on the 68000.</p>
<p>If you write software in C, it's only a bit more effort to make it
portable and compile it for many different CPU architectures.  Alll of
the tens of thousands of packages in Debian Linux are routinely built
for eleven different CPUs: the Alpha, the Opteron, the ARM (big and
little-endian), the HP PA-RISC, the Intel 386, the Itanic, the 68000,
the MIPS (big and little-endian), the PowerPC, the IBM System/390, and
the SPARC.  All of the 6400 packages in NetBSD run on all of its
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/ports/" title="Hardware supported by NetBSD">supported 16 CPU architectures</a>.  Some individual software
packages written in C have been ported to even more; GCC, for example,
runs on something like 30 CPU architectures.</p>
<p>This kind of portability has the advantage that you can switch CPU
architectures and keep using the same software --- and the hardware
exists only to support the software, anyway, just as the software
generally exists only to support human activities carried out with it.</p>
