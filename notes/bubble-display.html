(1 minute)</div><p>A bubble in gel scatters light.  I think it scatters an amount of
light proportional to its cross-sectional area, which is proportional
to the square of pressure.  If so, the average amount of light
scattered from the bubble is a function of the RMS of the pressure,
rather than the average pressure; oscillating pressure will increase
the total light scattered.</p>
<p>Gel without bubbles can operate as a fiber optic, restricting light to
within itself by total internal reflection.</p>
<p>By connecting a piezoelectric hydrophone to a bubbly gel column, you
can generate a traveling wave in the column.  But if the column is
closed, you can generate a <em>standing</em> wave, in which bubbles in some
parts of the column move back and forth, while bubbles in other parts
merely grow and shrink.  I think you can in fact generate an arbitrary
superposition of standing waves simply by taking the Fourier transform
of the desired display scattering function.  Then you can illuminate
the gel column with total internal reflection.</p>
<p>A somewhat better approach is probably to illuminate the column with a
small duty cycle so you don't have to deal with the multiple nodes and
antinodes.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/optics.html">Optics</a> (34 notes)
