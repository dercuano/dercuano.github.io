(4 minutes)</div><p>If you can build a high-speed routing network in a small amount of
silicon, you can build an extremely high-throughput multiplier for
high-latency multiplies by using square tables.</p>
<p>xy = ¼((x+y)² - (x-y)²); for example, 579×414 is ¼((579+414)² -
(579-414)²) = ¼(993² - 165²) = ¼(986049 - 27225) = ¼ 958824 = 239706.
(See <a href="../notes/multiplication-with-squares.html">Multiplication with squares</a> for more on this.)
This seems potentially interesting in the context of modern
high-throughput computing, in which multipliers occupy a significant
amount of silicon area and power consumption.  Squaring a number can
be done with a table lookup, which is relatively light on power
consumption.  The remaining addition and two subtractions can be done
quite a bit more easily.</p>
<p>The difficulty, of course, is that a large table occupies a very great
deal of silicon area.  But perhaps all is not lost — we can share this
large table among many concurrent multiplications, if they are
latency-tolerant.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, a 32-stream 10-bit×10-bit multiplier built using this
scheme.  Each pair of 10-bit numbers entering the multiplier at one of
32 multiplier ports gets its sum and difference taken; these are sent
into a mesh routing network to be squared, each tagged with an output
port.  The 1024-entry lookup table is split into 64 independently
operating lookup tables of 16 entries each; on every cycle, each such
lookup table receives a 10-bit input from the network along with the
routing tag (or, occasionally, an idle notification), and in a single
cycle places the 20-bit or 18-bit result and the routing tag onto a
second mesh routing network.  So, every cycle, we’re doing 64 10-bit
squarings.  These squares make their way through the second routing
network to output buffers, where they are paired up with their partner
from the input and subtracted.</p>
<p>The queuing-theory bit is somewhat tricky in that it’s totally
plausible to do a bunch of multiplications by the same number or by
similar numbers.  Similar numbers can be broken up a bit by some kind
of simple hash (x ^ x &gt;&gt; 5, for example) so they don’t all hit the
same lookup-table shard, but some amount of replication is probably
unavoidable to handle many multiplications by the same number.
Alternatively, perhaps the original numbers themselves could serve as
the routing tags, thus permitting the coalescence of multiple
concurrent requests for the same number; this would require somehow
duplicating the results on their way
to the subtractors.  Regardless, some amount of
nondeterminism in performance is unavoidable with this scheme.</p>
<p>The routing network from the inputs to the multiplication table can
probably consist of three layers of 16 4×4 17-bit crossbar switches
with output buffers to wait on contention; similarly the routing
network from the table to the output can probably consist of three
layers of 16 27-bit crossbar switches.</p>
<p>Such a device could carry out 32 10×10-bit multiplication results
every cycle, with a typical latency of 8 to 11 clock cycles.  The bulk
of the silicon area is the 1024-entry 20-bit (or 18-bit) square table;
the crossbars, adders, and subtractors should be relatively small by
comparison.  (Actually, is that bullshit?  Is it possible that those
crossbars are fucking huge, even though they don’t contain many
transistors, just because of the wires?)  Scaling it up to, say,
16-bit × 16-bit multiplications would involve scaling the table up to a
65536-entry 32-bit table, which is 100 times larger; but, if split
among a correspondingly larger number of independent table lookup
units, this would perform 4096 16×16-bit multiplications every cycle,
with a variable latency of 15 to 20 clock cycles.  At 400MHz, it would
provide 1.6 trillion low-precision multiplies per second.</p>
<p>If an electronic crossbar switch turns out to be infeasible, another
possibility is optical free-space routing.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
