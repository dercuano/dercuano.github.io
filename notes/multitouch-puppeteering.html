<p>In <a href="../notes/dercuano-drawings.html">Dercuano drawings</a> I’ve talked a bit about possible tools for
illustrating Dercuano without bloating it, and in <a href="../notes/two-thumb-quasimodal.html">Two-thumb quasimodal multitouch interaction techniques</a> and <a href="../notes/%25241-recognizer-diagrams.html">$1 recognizer diagrams</a>, among
others, I talked about possible multitouch interaction idioms that
could make this more practical.  But now I want to talk a bit about
possible ways of doing <em>animations</em>.</p>
<h2>Bret Victor’s turning-leaf animation demo</h2>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PUv66718DII">Bret Victor’s lecture <em>Inventing on
Principle</em></a> contains a demo of a
prototype multitouch animation application designed to circumvent the
limitations of things like Flash by, among other things, recording the
motion paths of fingers and using them to define motion paths for
cels, not just in position but also other dimensions such as rotation.
I had never seen an animation program work like this before, but it
turns out that the pioneering animation program GENESYS already worked
this way in 1970, I think on the TX-1, though using a light pen rather
than a capacitive multitouch screen.</p>
<p>There’s a 1970 video of GENESYS on YouTube; watching that and
<em>Inventing on Principle</em> are essential inspirations.</p>
<h2>Two-dimensional puppeteering</h2>
<p>GENESYS’s motion paths were essentially recorded puppeteering, but
were only capable of supplying two dimensions at any given time.  This
requires an additional pass over the animation to supply other
information, such as when to switch the image of a character between
different images — in GENESYS’s case, as in traditional cel animation,
discrete images, but as I pointed out in <a href="../notes/%25241-recognizer-diagrams.html">$1 recognizer diagrams</a>, morphing between pen strokes is a
straightforward thing to do.</p>
<p>Dimensions you might want to supply to a character path in an
animation are nearly unlimited — even with a single sprite image and
enough computrons to remap space in real time, they could include X,
Y, rotation, scale, stretch angle and direction, transparency,
brightness, contrast, tint, and two dimensions of perspective
distortion.  If an animation character has multiple images available,
they can be arranged in a multidimensional space using dimensions like
position-in-stride, mouth openness, age, fury, angel wings, deadness,
left hand X and Y, right hand X and Y, head position, and
explodedness, or a smaller number of dimensions could be used with a
sort of K-nearest-neighbor interpolation instead.</p>
<h2>More dimensions</h2>
<p>In Victor’s demo, he concurrently supplies a third
dimension — rotation — by using a second concurrent finger.  As I
noted in <a href="../notes/two-thumb-quasimodal.html">Two-thumb quasimodal multitouch interaction techniques</a>, this is typically the limit of
what people do with modern hand computers — although typical screens
and OSes track up to five touches, it’s unusual for people to use more
than two at a time.  Moreover, it’s common for one or both of the
touches to be thumb touches confined to an area near a corner of the
screen, while the rest of the user’s hand is supporting the computer
from behind.</p>
<p>(Some of them also track touch size and orientation, but these
variables are not very controllable, and are not available on all
touchscreens.)</p>
<p>I think it might be feasible to get people to puppeteer an animated
characters using two fingers on handles near the character, as with
pinch-zoom but with less finger occlusion, while their thumb near the
corner navigates a couple more dimensions of animation space.
Moreover, more than two handles may be available, so the position at
which they bring down a second finger onto the screen can indicate
which dimensions they would like to be puppeteering at that moment.</p>
<p>(Choosing among different candidate characters to puppeteer is another
reason for using handles positioned near the characters onscreen.)</p>
<p>Some animated characters, like Victor’s leaf, will rotate freely, but
many characters have a preferred orientation: a car or a text string
might be horizontal, while a human figure might be vertical.  Even
rotatable characters might not rotate all the time.  This means that
with two fingers on handles near the character, the user can both move
the character freely and continuously vary two more behavioral
dimensions (rather than zooming and rotating with the second finger),
such as mouth position and eyebrow position.  The thumb in the corner
can simultaneously be varying another pair of dimensions or invoking
other operations.</p>
<p>Marionettes are commonly operated primarily with a 6DoF controller
consisting of two crossed sticks, with the option to pull additional
strings with a finger.  The accelerometers in modern hand computers
similarly offer two more degrees of freedom, which can perhaps be used
advantageously.</p>
<p>This suggests that it should be possible to use a modern hand computer
for real-time puppeteering with 8 degrees of freedom varying
simultaneously in real time, with some of them chosen from among some
10 to 16.</p>
<h2>Interaction with previous recording</h2>
<p>The above is perhaps fine for when you’re recording a new animation,
or puppeteering live for an audience or to play a game, but when
you’re editing an existing animation, there’s the question of how new
puppeteering movements interact with the previously recorded ones.
Perhaps they overwrite them — this should at least be an option — or
perhaps they normally just add to them.  This is especially
troublesome if the primary handle you use to select a character to
puppeteer is also the handle you use to move it around: does that mean
you have to overwrite the existing movement path in order to add new
eyebrow movements?  Perhaps there’s a fuzzy transition from merely
selecting to overriding movements.</p>
<p>We could think of these degrees of freedom as “tracks” that we’re
recording, like in a multitrack digital audio workstation; as in
GENESYS and Victor’s demo, we’ll need to be able to see the tracks on
the screen, select parts of them to be copied, moved, or erased, and
so on.</p>
<h2>Track inference</h2>
<p>Probably by default some characters should infer tracks like moving
through walking paces, making jumping motions, breathing, and turning
to face different directions from lower-dimensionality data, like
position and movement direction and speed.  Butterflies flutter,
falling leaves twirl, cars rock back and forth, humanoids turn to face
the direction they’re walking, toons wind up and screech to a halt,
balls bounce, frogs hop, and so on.  Users can always control these
tracks explicitly if they like.</p>
<p>To some extent you could think of this as being like the “artistic
style transfer” problem that so many artificial neural network papers
have made so much spectacular progress on recently: for a character to
walk realistically, they need to move not only their legs but also
their hips, their arms, their shoulders, and their spine, and ideally
those movements can be generated from a model of the movements the
puppeteer is controlling explicitly.  I suspect some kind of
K-nearest-neighbors kind of thing based on an existing motion corpus,
mixed with some linear prediction, might be sufficient, but maybe
you’d end up needing a more sophisticated model like a neural network.
Regardless, the space is of very small dimensionality relative to the
spaces recent papers are training neural networks on, so the problem
should be significantly more tractable once you have some data.</p>
<h2>Face tracking</h2>
<p>An alternative to puppeteering facial expressions with multitouch is
to use the hand computer’s front camera to detect a human user’s
facial expressions in real time so they can be used to provide some of
the tracks.  (Latency may be a problem at present.)  This is most
intuitive for humanoid character facial expressions, of course, but it
could be used for a variety of other tracks as well.</p>
<h2>Multiscreen puppeteering</h2>
<p>Many popular puppets are operated by more than one person
simultaneously in order to handle more degrees of freedom than a
traditional marionette, without losing the immediacy of real-time
performance.  Different people, each using a personal hand computer,
could also do this.</p>
<p>Extending this further, you could strap several old cellphones with
accelerometers (and perhaps with broken screens) to different parts of
a person’s body in order to get a real-time feed of rotoscoping-like
information, with two degrees of freedom per cellphone; then you might
be able to entirely avoid the use of touchscreens.</p>
<h2>Yaw-axis and position detection</h2>
<p>Above I suggested that the accelerometers in a modern hand computer
offered two degrees of freedom, because most of the signal they
provide just tells you which direction gravity is.  In fact they
usually provide six readings: three axes of accelerometer and three of
“gyroscope”, but these do not provide absolute position and yaw
information, just pitch and roll, as it were.  Typically they also
have a flux-gate compass as well, but its readings are slow and noisy,
so you have to filter it over a considerable period of time to get a
useful reading.</p>
<p>However, you might be able to use the slow filtered compass reading to
provide a sort of low-frequency yaw signal, then the faster (but
relative, so high-frequency-filtered) gyroscope signals to update it
in real time.  Similarly, it might be reasonable to assume that on
average (over, say, a minute) the computer is stationary, and use the
shorter-term variations in accelerometer readings as adjusted by the
gyros to compute where in the local space it is.</p>
<p>Of course, none of the above is new — inertial navigation systems
have worked like this since, I think, the 1940s, though using actual
gyroscopes and larger accelerometers.  But using it for puppeteering
or rotoscoping purposes seems to be new.</p>
<p>Photogrammetry could provide an additional source of high-precision
ground truth for absolute yaw measurements.</p>
<h2>Non-sprite virtual puppets</h2>
<p>In addition to simple 2-D sprites, you could use this approach to
puppeteer 3-D models of varying degrees of sophistication, as well as
2-D models more complex than simple sprites: 2-D models with
skeletons, say, or assemblages of separate sprites for different body
parts.  Particle systems can be attached to the puppets, perhaps just
in certain circumstances.  Drawings can be progressively traced.</p>
<h2>Dancing in more abstract spaces</h2>
<p>Of course, interactively defining a time-indexed parametric curve in
spaces of 16 dimensions or so, with real-time feedback, has many
applications other than imitating Walt Disney.  Modern video-game
character models commonly have more dimensions than this, but the
games have only very clumsy ways of navigating them, navigating from
slider to slider.</p>
<p>Ad-hoc mathematical models of phenomena — physical system simulation,
like Victor’s active-filter example in the same talk, or
otherwise — can easily have that many dimensions to explore.</p>
<p>Fractal graphics commonly have many continuous parameters which are
interesting to explore.</p>
<p>A music synthesizer, too, has many such parameters, and recording how
they change over time is a crucial part of recording music.  This,
especially with the accelerometers, is of course the core of <a href="https://youtu.be/cqgX8H72LPs">Onyx
Ashanti’s inspiring work on Beatjazz</a>.</p>
<p>Plots of multivariate data can only display a few dimensions at a
time; varying plot parameters dynamically, as with one of Victor’s
other demos in the same talk, is useful not only for exploration but
also for explanation to an audience.</p>
<p>Theater lighting is another case where you need to record a path
through a continuous multivariate space and then play it back,
typically with some degree of interactive control over timing.</p>
<p>Manually planning a motion path for an industrial robot or CNC machine
is another possible use.  Of course, you can also use this approach
for control of such a machine in real time.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/hci.html">Human–computer interaction</a> (76 notes)
