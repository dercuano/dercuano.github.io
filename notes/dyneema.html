(2 minutes)</div><p>I think I found some Dyneema fishing line for AR$100 a roll at El
Brujo, Sarmiento 2443.  Green, braided.  This scrap of 50-pound
(22.7 kg) line he gave me is about 0.35 mm diameter, which works out
to 2.3 GPa strength, and it floats, which suggests it is sure enough
Dyneema.  It’s a Chinese brand and doesn't say “Dyneema”, “Spectra”,
or “UHMWPE”.  He has rolls of several different diameters for $100,
but I don’t know if they’re different lengths or what.</p>

Triple Fish Bully Braid Dyneema fishing line: 100 meters for AR$305 ≈
US$22.  They claim the 0.14 mm diameter line is good to 10.2 kg, which
would be 6.5 GPa, almost three times the strength.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene</a>
gives 2.4 GPa as its strength.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA606636">http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA606636</a> gives a variety of
higher strengths in their tests, ranging from 3.63 ± 0.19 GPa up to
4.25 ± 0.21 GPa, with the higher strengths being achieved at higher
strain rates up to a kilostrain per second (i.e. loadings more like
bullet impacts).  For Dyneema SK76, it also shows nice linear Hookean
elastic stress-strain curves with a Young’s modulus of about 100 GPa.
This is about twice as compliant as a steel, and stronger than most
steels.</p>
<p>(Dividing out, 2.4 GPa / 100 GPa is 2.4% elongation at break, which is
almost three times what steel gives you.  If we suppose the 100 GPa
number is accurate for the Bully Braid, that’s 6.5% elongation at
break, 65 mm/m, which works out to a spring energy capacity of (65 mm
10.2 kg gravity / 2) = 3.25 J/m; the whole roll holds 325 J for
14.8 J/US$.)</p>

suggests that different varieties of UHMWPE have substantially
different strengths and very substantially different stiffnesses.</p>
<p>It’s kind of amazing to think that five strands of this fishing line
could support me.</p>

gives a coefficient of static friction for UHMWPE on steel of .15–.20
and of dynamic friction .12–.20, or .05–.08 if oiled.  This suggests
that for many purposes, you can run oiled UHMWPE cord around round
steel bars without pulleys, avoiding the </p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/materials.html">Materials</a> (112 notes)
