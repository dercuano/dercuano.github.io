<p>Foreseeably, most personal computers now are hand computers, commonly
called “cell phones” or “mobile phones”, for archaic reasons (with a
few exceptions called by names like “e-readers”).  Less foreseeably,
they mostly run user interfaces that limit the user’s power over them
considerably; in particular, although they generally have WWW browsers
and most of them can download files and save them locally, they cannot
extract a .tar.gz file full of HTML and browse it.</p>
<p>This poses a problem for Dercuano, because right now I am publishing
it as a .tar.gz file full of HTML.  But its objective is to remain
readable even if my server or domain name fails, as they inevitably
will someday.  It’s really important (to me, anyway) that people be
able to continue reading Dercuano in that case.  There are a variety
of possible alternative formats that could work well on hand
computers.</p>
<h2>The problem: gratuitous handicaps and tiny screens</h2>
<p>Hand computers have an additional problem, aside from being
gratuitously crippled in a way that requires compatibility hacks:
<strong>their screens are tiny</strong>.  For example, until I broke the screen, I
was using a discount hand computer with a 45×63 mm screen; a more
modern one I looked at last night has a 64×115 mm screen.  Also, the
screens used to be low resolution: the PalmPilot was 160×160
(monochrome!), and the original iPhone was 320×480.  (At 163 pixels
per inch, that was 50×74 mm, bigger than the one I broke.)  Modern
cellphones have much higher-resolution screens, and e-readers
generally have much larger screens, though with fewer pixels.</p>
<p>Making text readable at all on such small screen sizes requires
serious compromises in typographic design.  For example, the
typography I’m using at the moment (see <a href="../notes/dercuano-stylesheet-notes.html">Dercuano stylesheet notes</a>) is “22px”, with max-width of 45em and
line-height of 1.5 (em), and 1 em of padding around the body; on my
158 dpi laptop screen, that’s a font size of 3.5 mm or 10 (PostScript)
points, with 5.3 mm from one baseline to the next.  I use a ragged
right margin extra vertical whitespace between paragraphs, as is
normal on the WWW, and a somewhat smaller font size for <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>
blocks.</p>
<p>At this font size, on my 45×63 mm screen in portrait mode (my
observations on the subway and bus suggest that people strongly prefer
using their hand computers in portrait mode, only switching to
landscape mode to watch landscape-mode videos, play landscape-mode
video games, or occasionally read PDF files whose lines are too long),
the 7 mm of padding on the left and right would leave room for almost
13 ems of text, about four or five words’ worth.  Using the greedy
paragraph-filling algorithm web standards short-sightedly require (at
least in the case where there are floats, according to pcwalton), and
especially without hyphenation, this would frequently have lines with
only one or two words on them.  Less than 12 of these tiny lines would
fit on the screen, one of which will frequently be consumed by a
paragraph break, so you might have 40 words of actual text on the
screen.</p>
<p>Worse, Chromium’s Blink HTML engine, like the WebKit and KHTML engines
it derives from, doesn’t support hyphenation at all; Firefox’s Gecko
engine is the only significant WWW browser engine that does, and on
hand computers, almost nobody uses Firefox.</p>
<p>Once you add any extra block indentation, like that in a blockquote or
indented list, the situation quickly deteriorates to one or two words
per line.</p>
<p>Reducing the text size to a less-comfortable size is a necessary
compromise to avoid such uncomfortably short line lengths.
(Generally, when I read things on it, I also used portrait mode.)
Also, though, using less padding around the text is very helpful (in
this example, using 0.5em instead of 1em padding would increase the
text column width from 13em to 14em).  The line length will still
necessarily be shorter, which reduces the need for leading between
lines to avoid disorientation when moving from one line to the next.</p>
<p>It’s possible to do far worse than my default style on hand computers,
though.  The worst reading experiences on hand computers are when you
have very long lines in PDFs or ASCII text files with hard line
breaks, such that even in landscape mode, you can’t fit an entire line
on the screen at a readable font size.  This requires you to scroll
left and right on every single line to read the text.</p>
<p>Somewhat less annoying are academic papers which preserve the
traditional book layout of two columns of text per page, rather than
the single-column layout that has become popular recently, since about
1850.  The columns are generally narrow enough to be readable on the
tiny hand computer screen, which is a great blessing, but once you
reach the end of one, you have to spend several seconds panning
diagonally across the page to find the top of the next one — and, half
the time, that’s the wrong thing to do, because the next column is on
the next page.</p>
<p>(I lied, though.  The worst reading experiences on hand computers are
file formats you don’t have an app for.)</p>
<p>Some kind of adaptation to widely varying screen sizes is necessary,
since hand computers in common use range from the kind of tiny 45×63
screen I mentioned up to Amazon Swindles with 600×800 screens at
167 dpi grayscale, which works out to 91×122 mm, almost 4× as big, and
51% bigger than the 64×115 mm “cellphone” I mentioned above.  (For
comparison, a page of <a href="dercuano-stylesheet-notes.html#ticktock">a paperback
book</a> is 105×175 mm and about
600 dpi, but without grayscale.)</p>
<h2>Possible formats</h2>
<h3>DHTML with offline reading via cache-manifest or service workers</h3>
<p>The first thing that occurred to me was that I could just add a
cache-manifest to the HTML generated for Dercuano so that when a
browser loads one page, it loads them all into the appcache, and (at
least if you bookmark the thing) the whole thing remains accessible
even if you’re offline or the server goes down.</p>
<p>This has the advantage that anything that works in the current HTML
tarball incarnation of Dercuano would keep working the same way.  In
fact, more things would work — the difficulties with full-text
indexing I mentioned in <a href="../notes/dercuano-search.html">Dercuano search</a> wouldn’t exist.</p>
<p>This is the lowest-effort approach, but it wouldn’t work very well.
Although the cache-manifest mechanism is widely supported, including
on pretty much all hand computers, it’s considered obsolescent (the
documentation for it has been removed from the current version of the
WHATWG standard), to be replaced with the new and shiny
service-workers mechanism.  Since Firefox 60 and Chrome 69, it’s also
unavailable if you aren’t using HTTPS.  It enjoys invisible resource
limits — the amount a browser is willing to cache is not exposed to
the user, but typically it’s 5MB or 10MB, and if the download fails
because not enough space is available, no error message is given; it
just fails when you’re offline or the server is down.</p>
<p>There’s a sort of polyfill to support the cache-manifest API on top of
ServiceWorker, but ServiceWorker also requires HTTPS.</p>
<p>The bigger problem, though, is that both service workers and the
appcache are totally dependent on, and vulnerable to, the origin
server.  This violates my intent with Dercuano in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If my server is down, one person with a copy of Dercuano would not
   be able to give it to another person, except by giving them their
   entire browser state.  This means that once my server is gone,
   copies of Dercuano would gradually diminish one by one until they
   are all gone, rather than being shared with new people who want
   them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If malicious actors gain access to my server or my domain, they
   could use that access to delete all the copies of Dercuano, if it
   were using service workers or appcache.  Malicious actors have
   gained access to the vast majority of domains that were on the web
   20 years ago, usually to put generic linkspam pages on formerly
   high-PageRank domains, so it’s a good bet that this will happen
   sooner or later to canonical.org.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a patent examiner reads some idea in their copy of Dercuano, and
   Dercuano uses service workers or appcache, they can’t tell if that
   idea was inserted into their copy of Dercuano the last time they
   connected to the internet, or ten years earlier.  This means that
   ideas in Dercuano would not be able to serve as prior art to
   invalidate patent claims, as “rapid genetic evolution of regular
   expressions” did.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>MobiPocket .mobi format</h3>
<p>A more reasonable alternative approach, for which I am indebted to
cajg, is to convert Dercuano into some kind of ebook format.  Ebook
formats in general solve the three problems I mentioned above.</p>
<p>The popular Amazon Swindle hand computer uses a variant of this
format.  I don’t know much about it, but it’s not fully documented in
public.  Its text is formatted with (X)HTML and CSS.  Mobipocket
themselves did a bunch of work on hyphenation, but their work is no
longer available (except on the Swindle), and other .mobi readers may
not have such good hyphenation support.</p>
<p>Support for .mobi files is not available on most e-readers (except the
Swindle), and on cellphones it is available but not installed by
default.  You can install, for example, Okular or FBReader to be able
to read them.</p>
<p>.mobi doesn’t seem to have very good graphics support — in particular,
nothing like SVG or EPS, <em>but</em> it does support embedded JS which
could, in theory, implement that kind of thing, maybe.  It supports
embedded GIFs and JPEGs, but with a size limit of 63 KiB.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if one part of a .mobi file can contain a hyperlink to
another arbitrary part of it, although it does of course support
tables of contents.  This is important for Dercuano.</p>
<h3>.ePub format, the modern replacement for .mobi</h3>
<p>EPUB, as it’s sometimes written, continued to evolve after .mobi
forked from it around 2005, and the current version <em>does</em> support SVG
images.  It’s fully documented, not suffering from the
reverse-engineering problem .mobi does.  Otherwise (in terms of
supported features, preservability, file size, and so on) it seems to
be pretty similar.</p>
<h3>One giant HTML file</h3>
<p>At first I didn’t think of this as an option, since my experience with
hand computers is that they typically can’t read HTML offline
reliably.</p>
<p>Recent versions of (Chrome on) Android are capable of saving HTML
pages for offline reading, including the CSS and JS and whatnot, so
combining the entire contents of Dercuano into a single
fifteen-megabyte, six-thousand-page HTML file might be a possible
alternative.  This would probably require fiddling with the CSS and JS
a bit to get it to scale and not clash, but perhaps more importantly,
I think Blink may choke on such large HTML documents; it’s designed
for HTML files two or three orders of magnitude smaller.  Even Dillo
might balk.</p>
<p>It appears Chrome is saving a multipart/related MIME document with a
filename ending in ".mhtml", which is a totally reasonable way to do
this, and provides a reasonably readable file adhering to well-known
standards, in a single file.  It does, however, have a couple of
significant drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Basically any useful access to it requires reading the whole thing,
   though that’s really probably the least of your troubles if 90% of
   it is a 15-megabyte HTML document.</li>
<li>If you open the file in Chrome from a file manager, Chrome renders
   it as plain text.  It’s only when you load it from the “downloads”
   app that Chrome opens it as expected.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not clear on how easy it is to transfer these from one hand
computer to another, which, as I was saying earlier, is a sine qua
non.  I was hoping it would be a matter of just copying the .mhtml
file across, but it doesn’t seem to be.</p>
<p>However, the one-giant-HTML-file approach might be useful as a first
step in other workflows, like creating PDFs or ePubs.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>That brings us to PDF, which is usually in last place in anyone’s list
of candidate document formats, due to decades of painful experiences;
PDF doesn’t support text reflow†, so using it for hand computers whose
screens vary by a factor of about 4 would seem, at best, perverse.
However, for better or worse, PDF is supported by almost all hand
computers (Android, iOS, and Swindle all ship with PDF support out of
the box), and it always looks the same, within the limits of the
screen or printer, while maintaining a file size similar to that of
gzipped HTML.  It supports hyperlinks, including hyperlinks within the
document, and it supports vector graphics, including transparency
(though not, as far as I know, SVG-like convolution filters).  PDF is
designed for random access, so a few thousand pages in a document is
not a problem on modern computers, including hand computers.</p>
<p>PDF also has the advantage that there are a lot of people out there
who take seriously the problems of archiving PDFs and making them
searchable.  The ISO has a PDF standard and also a standard for a
“PDF/A” subset designed for archival.  (Well, several
non-backwards-compatible versions of the standard, actually, which
likely defeats the purpose, but possibly they’ll pull their heads out
of their asses at some point.)</p>
<p>The worst problems with reading PDF on hand computers, as I said
above, result from formatting with long lines.  Wide margins are a
secondary offense, since in many readers they mean you have to zoom to
a readable size every time you switch pages, and when panning on
touchscreens, you’re always at risk of panning a little bit diagonally
and losing the last few letters of the column you’re trying to read.</p>
<p>Typically, though, PDF viewers only let you pan diagonally when you’re
zoomed in in two dimensions.  If you have the entire page width
visible, you can only pan vertically, and if you’re looking at the
entire page, you can’t pan at all.</p>
<p>† Recent versions of acroread do claim PDF reflow support, but I
haven’t tried it.</p>
<h3>.chm</h3>
<p>Microsoft distributes help files in CHM format, which, like ePub, is
an archive (in “.cab” “cabinet” format, IIRC) full of HTML files.
This used to be popular as a way to distribute technical books, and
maybe it still is, but support on hand computers is limited.  Play
Store app reviews suggest that nowadays it’s found a niche for
distributing medical reference books to doctors.</p>
<h2>My proposed solution: PDF with pages of 24 ems × 60 ems with ½ em of margin all around</h2>
<p>Maybe PDF’s vices can be turned into virtues.</p>
<p>Consider a page that measures 24 ems by 60 ems, with 1.2-em line
spacing and ½ em of margin, so eight to twelve words per line, much
like a paperback book, but with much taller pages: 49 lines.  On my
tiny 45×63 mm hand computer, these numbers give a barely bearable
5.3-point font in portrait mode and a tolerable 7.4-point font in
landscape mode, when the page is zoomed to fit the width of the
display rather than its height.  On the larger 64×115 one I mentioned
earlier, these numbers are a tolerable 7.6-point font in portrait mode
and an eminently readable 13.6-point font in landscape mode.  Indeed,
even fitting the height of the page to the display gives a bearable
5.4-point font on that machine.</p>
<p>These four possibilities — landscape zoom-to-width, landscape
zoom-to-height, portrait zoom-to-width, and portrait
zoom-to-height — provide four roughly evenly spaced magnification
levels covering a linear zoom range of about three to four times, or
an areal zoom of about 12 to 20 times.  None of them suffer the janky
diagonal panning problems that plague PDF reading on hand computers,
since none of them require zooming in so far that diagonal zooming is
possible.  The number of words per line is suboptimal but readable.</p>
<p>Some screen real estate to the left and right of the page is left
unused.  On a 91×122 mm Swindle, zooming to fit the whole 60-em-tall
page in portrait mode gives you a 5.8-point font, but only the middle
49 mm of the display is used.  Many PDF readers (I don’t remember
about the Swindle’s) offer an option to view pairs of facing pages
next to each other, rather than single pages; doing this on a
Swindle-sized screen would give you a 5.4-point font, which is still
bearable, and two pages of text at a time.</p>
<p>If we think of an em as nominally representing 12 PostScript points,
the 24×60 em page size is 102 mm (4 inches in archaic units) by 254 mm
(10 inches in archaic units).  So this column size actually closely
approximates the size of a column in a traditional two-column folio
page, or a two-column A4 or US letter-sized page.</p>
<p>Given how precious hand-computer screen real estate is, we’d probably
want to use indentation, rather than extra vertical space, to
demarcate paragraphs, in the way that has been standard for several
centuries.  The addition of PDF’s unavoidable page breaks with ragged
right margins adds an additional rationale for this: if a sentence
starts at the beginning of a line at the top of a page, how can we
tell if it starts a new paragraph or not?  It will have extra
whitespace above it simply because of the page break.</p>
<p>A hypothetical PDF reader that supported zooming to fit the page
height, with more than two pages next to each other, would allow
reading any number of such columns with horizontal scrolling.</p>
<p>To some extent, small font sizes can be compensated by holding the
computer closer to your face, wearing reading glasses, and squinting,
but a more absolute limit — without resorting to temporal
antialiasing, anyway — is the actual number of pixels.  I’ve done a
3½×6 pixel font that is marginally readable, and I think you can do
better than that with antialiasing and especially subpixel rendering,
but usually a minimum for reasonable letterforms is 5×8 pixels, and
standard VGA fonts were 8×16.  But at these line widths, that’s not
going to be a problem.  If we divide the original iPhone’s 320-pixel
width by 24 ems, we get a line height of 13 pixels, so an average
glyph of around 6×13 pixels.  And modern hand computers have
considerably more pixels than that.</p>
<p>Given that all these point sizes are a little on the small side, and
the actual paperback book I was looking at has lines of only about 20
ems wide and is eminently readable, you’d think I could get by with a
font size about 10% or 20% larger than what’s implied above (and thus
21% or 44% less areally dense).  45 mm / 21 em would be 2.1 mm per em,
which is a 6-point font; in landscape mode, the same tiny screen would
have 63 mm / 21 em = 8.5 points, which is easily readable.  But the
other force pushing for smaller fonts and wider lines is the
occasional <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> block, which needs to be able to accommodate 80
columns, nominally 40 ems.  That’s a text size of 0.6 em for the
<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>.  Using an even larger font size for the normal body text
would cause an even larger disharmony between the two text sizes.</p>
<h3>Hyperlinks in PDF</h3>
<p>PDF supports tables of contents and hyperlinks, but at least the
default PDF viewer on Android 7.0 (which is the Google Drive PDF viewer)
doesn’t seem to have any way to see
them.  It has a fairly effective scrollbar, though, so page numbers
may be a reasonable replacement — but they need to count monotonically
from 1 at the beginning, since the page numbers displayed in the
Android viewer do that; even though PDF supports page numbers that do
things like “i, ii, iii, iv, 1, 2”, they are not displayed.</p>
<h3>ZUI in PDF for navigating illustrations?</h3>
<p>Illustrations (see <a href="../notes/dercuano-drawings.html">Dercuano drawings</a>) are a really hard problem
in HTML-based formats for small screens: your lines are already too
short to flow text around large pictures, and small pictures are
unreadable unless they contain only a little bit of information, like
sparklines.  But if we assume that the reader is using a hand computer
with pinch-to-zoom, and our image format is vector, perhaps we can
rely on zooming to provide more information about illustrations on
demand, and even some degree of hierarchical navigation.</p>
<p>Hyperlink navigation within the illustration is probably not
supported, though, and the maximum zoom is probably quite limited; the
popular AndroidPdfViewer open-source component defaults to 3× as its
default maximum zoom, but the Android 7.0 default PDF viewer defaults
to 10×.  It also permits zooming <em>out</em> until several pages are on the
screen, though, sadly, stacked vertically.</p>
<h3>Hyphenation and equations in PDF</h3>
<p>The major advantage of PDF over the HTML-based formats is that things
will look exactly as I formatted them.  This means that I don’t have
to rely on hyphenation support on the reader’s computer; I can use a
decent hyphenation algorithm, and if necessary I can tweak the text to
deal with rotten formatting (although, honestly, I’m trying to import
a couple of million words of unfinished notes into this thing; I can’t
stop to futz with per-paragraph formatting on more than a tiny part of
it).</p>
<p>Also, an enormous advantage accrues to math formatting (see <a href="../notes/dercuano-formula-display.html">Dercuano formula display</a>).  In theory, EPUB supports some part of
MathML, but MathML rendering is generally kind of shitty (where it’s
not done through MathJax), and writing MathML is worse.  With PDF, I
can render equations at build time using T<sub>E</sub>X, subsetting
Computer Modern fonts as necessary to include just the glyphs I’m
using, and get well-formatted formulas.</p>
<h2>Further progress</h2>
<h3>2019-12-28</h3>
<p>I've hacked together a janky PDF by parsing the Dercuano output HTML
as XML, and now most of the content of Dercuano is readable in this
format.</p>
<h4>Page sizes and typewriter font woes</h4>
<p>Initially I tried the "24 ems × 60 ems with ½ em of margin"
configuration described above, but I found it to be uncomfortably
narrow.  For regular running text it was reasonably okay, and for
low-resolution cellphones that probably means "ideal", but for
80-column-wide <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> blocks, it was terrible --- that's 0.3 ems per
character, and Courier really wants more like 0.63 ems per character,
which would be over 50 ems, making non-<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> text of the same size
uncomfortably wide and also requiring a high-resolution screen for
readability without constant diagonal scrolling.</p>
<p>(I haven't actually implemented <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> proper yet.)</p>
<p>Another pressure is that 24 ems is too narrow for a large number of
URLs.  At some point I guess I'll have to implement some kind of line
continuation for long strings like that, but having less broken lines
like that will always be better.</p>
<p>However, to some extent text dimensions are fungible.  Making text
taller makes it more legible, as does making it wider.  The much
harder constraint on <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> text is its width; scrolling more because
it is taller than would be ideal is far preferable.  So, a reasonable
alternative is to use a compressed font.  I found Bogusław Jackowski
and Janusz M. Nowacki's font <a href="https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/latinmodernmonolightcondensed/">Latin Modern Mono Light
Condensed</a>, which
comes in regular and oblique versions (but no bold), which is derived
originally from Knuth's Computer Modern Teletype, which is in the
public domain; but Latin Modern has much broader coverage of some 760
Unicode characters than <code>cmtt</code> does.</p>
<p><code>lmtlc</code>, as this font is called in the T<sub>E</sub>X Live
distribution, demands only about 0.36 ems of horizontal space per
character, and is still quite readable, although visibly compressed.
I had to use FontForge to convert it from <a href="https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/lm/fonts/opentype/public/lm">the OTF on
CTAN</a>
because Reportlab said, "TTF file "lmmonoltcond10-oblique.otf":
postscript outlines are not supported."</p>
<p>So I've widened the page width to some 29 ems (and extended it
vertically to 66 ems, purely for reasons of silly nostalgic printer
traditions --- US letter paper is, in medieval units, 11 inches long,
and a standard 12-point line height thus gives you 66 lines).  This
reduces the page count from some 4700 to 3700.  Even 3700 seems large
for a book of only 1.3 million words or less, but 500 of those pages
are the topic listings at the end.</p>
<p>As I said before, a key consideration is for the PDF version of
Dercuano to be readable on hand computers without diagonal scrolling
or reflowing, because reflowing a PDF is pretty hard.  This has two
aspects: pixel readability and absolute size.</p>
<p>As for pixel readability, reviewing dimensions from above, the
PalmPilot was 160x160, and the iPhone 1 was 320x480.  At 24 ems wide
in landscape mode, 480 pixels is 20 pixels per em, like a 10x20 xterm
font; this is quite comfortable.  160 pixels across 24 ems is only 6.7
pixels per em, which is at the very edge of readability.  So, by going
to 29 ems, I'm sacrificing PalmPilot readability, which would be 5.5
PalmPilot pixels per em, but 16.6 original-iPhone pixels per em ---
still quite readable in landscape mode.</p>
<p>In addition to avoiding pixelation to prevent unreadability in an
absolute sense, I'd also like to keep the letters reasonably large in
millimeters to avoid sacrificing
readability-without-a-magnifying-glass.  The original iPhone was 50x74
mm; 50 mm across 29 ems is 1.72 pixels per em, which is 4.9 printer's
points.  That's a pretty small font!  That's why I was trying to make
do with 24 ems.  But in landscape mode on an iPhone-1-sized device
that would be a 7.2-point font, suboptimal but not outside the realm
of readability.  On the discount hand computer I was using earlier
this year, the screen was 45x63 mm.  29 ems across 63 mm makes it a
6.1-point font: painful to read, but, again, not infeasible.</p>
<p>If that hadn't worked, maybe
/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/cm-unicode/cmuntt.otf
would have been another possibility, maybe with some kind of
coordinate transformation.</p>
<h4>Remaining major bugs</h4>
<p>I have a number of showstopper bugs left in the PDF generation; among
them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vertical positioning is wrong, so PDF links are displaced vertically
  relative to their target text, and I have to leave a bunch of extra bottom
  margin to minimize the number of pages that get truncated.</li>
<li>I haven't implemented <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> yet.</li>
<li>The 3% or so of notes that aren't well-formed XML are getting
  totally mangled, with mojibake and total loss of formatting.  For
  many of these, getting the formatting totally right would require
  implementing tables and SVG, which may not be in the cards this
  weekend, but surely I can do better than this.</li>
<li>I haven't implemented font cascade fallbacks yet for missing characters.</li>
<li>The ET Book license needs to be included.</li>
<li><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code> puts the paragraph on a separate line from the
  <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> bullet.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a lot of other bugs that aren't showstoppers but might
be easy to fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headers aren't red.</li>
<li>Headers aren't underlined.</li>
<li>Line spacing is too tight.</li>
<li>Blockquotes aren't visibly distinct at all.</li>
<li><code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> contents are treated as text.</li>
<li>I don't have page numbers on links yet.</li>
<li>An extra space gets added after the ends of every HTML element.</li>
<li>Notes aren't in any order in the PDF file.</li>
<li>I think it's splitting on no-break spaces as well as normal spaces,
  so they aren't no-break.</li>
<li>The link to lua-%23-operator may be broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>And other bugs that are serious but maybe aren't in either category:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no per-note tables of contents.</li>
<li>There are no superscripts or subscripts.</li>
<li><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> isn't bulleted.</li>
<li>The PDF is huge, like 12 megs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Font cascade fallback fonts</h4>
<p>As a fallback for monospaced text,
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/droid/DroidSansMono.ttf might work, although
it's going to be much wider than lmtlc and only covers 874 codepoints
(though some of those are things I use that aren't in lmtlc!).
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-liberation/LiberationMono-Regular.ttf
covers only 663.
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu-font-family/UbuntuMono-R.ttf has
1225, comparable to the 1259 in
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/cour.ttf.
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf has 3197, and
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeMono.ttf has 4126.  Moreover,
FreeMono has 3511 codepoints that lmtlc doesn't, and DejaVu Sans Mono
has 2645, of which 515 are also not in FreeMono.</p>
<p>So, for monospace coverage, if you had to choose a single fallback
font with no worries about licensing, it would be FreeMono, expanding
lmtlc's 760 codepoints to 4271, but if you could choose a second one,
DejaVu Sans Mono would expand that to 4786.</p>
<p>For serif body text, ET Book (a copy of Bembo) covers only 233
codepoints.  The corresponding brand-name fallback fonts would be
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf with 6450 codepoints
and /usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSerif.ttf (my browser's
standard fallback) with 3331 codepoints.  From the size, it is clear
that neither of these covers Chinese; the built-in PDF font that seems
to work best for Chinese (in Reportlab, the PDF-generation library I'm
using) is <code>reportlab.pdfbase.cidfonts.UnicodeCIDFont('STSong-Light')</code>,
which is sadly a gothic monoline (I would say "sans-serif" but of
course what's missing isn't really serifs) font.  Also, I've figured
out how to tell which codepoints a TrueType font covers using
Reportlab: <code>reportlab.pdfbase.ttfonts.TTFontFile(
'/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu-font-family/UbuntuMono-R.ttf').charToGlyph</code>
is a dict.  I don't know how to do this for STSong-Light, so I don't
know how to fall back from it.</p>
<p><a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/">Freefont</a> is a GNU
project, although it seems to have largely gone idle in 2012.  The
licensing is GPLv3+, which is <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/freefont-bugs/2019-09/msg00009.html">somewhat aggressive as fonts
go</a>,
and it's not clear that there's a legal way to embed it, or a subset
of it, into a PDF file and then convey that PDF file to others.</p>
<p>Oh, actually there's a special exception for document embedding in its

<p>DejaVu is an extended version of Bitstream Vera, which was distributed
under a BSD-like license that requires changing the name of extended
versions; the DejaVu changes are in the public domain.  They are far
from complete Unicode coverage, lacking even some Greek and Cyrillic
and most Arabic, as well as all the Indic scripts.  Still, I think it
might cover most of the characters I actually use.</p>
<p>DejaVu Serif isn't very harmonious with ET Book; it's a slab-serif
font with little emphasis and a tall x-height --- roughly as far as it
could be from ET Book while still being technically a serif font.  It
does have ℤ and ² and ³ and ⁶⁴ and μ and × and ∞ and ÷ and Ω and ≈ and
⇒ ∃ ε ∈ ₀₁ †, though many of them copy and paste wrong.  Combining
arrow above v⃗ is missing (renders as an empty box), but maybe I'm
outputting it wrong.  And it's missing ℓ.  But those are the only
things I've seen missing so far.</p>
<p>The elusive 'ℓ' is found in FreeMono, Liberation Mono, (Microsoft's)
Courier New, and Droid Sans Mono, and likely their non-monospaced
equivalents as well.  Liberation is a Red Hat font set licensed under
the GPLv2 with a document-embedding exception plus some other weird
anti-Tivoization exception.</p>
<p>Liberation Serif covers ≈, †, ∞, ←↓↑→, ² and ³, and Greek, but not ⁻⁶
or ɑ or ₂ or ⁴⁸ or ℤ.  It's somewhat more harmonious with ET Book.</p>
<p>Freefont's FreeSerif is considerably more harmonious with ET Book than
the others, and it does contain ℓ.</p>
<h4>Misparsed data</h4>
<p>I've been trying to use ElementTidy to read in the things ElementTree
can't handle directly, about 30 of the 997 notes in Dercuano,
but this has been failing completely.  One
reason is that the tag names it gives me are bullshit like
'{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}html'.  Another is that it seems to be
parsing things as some incorrect encoding.</p>
<p><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=576343">elementtidy is apparently
dead</a> having
just been removed from Debian a few months ago, so it may not have
been the best choice...</p>
<p>This seems to work to solve the mojibake problem:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = TidyHTMLTreeBuilder.TidyHTMLTreeBuilder(encoding='utf-8')
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.feed(open('dercuano-20191226/notes/nova-rdos.html').read())
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = b.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Although honestly, looking at the source, I think this does the same
thing without TidyHTMLTreeBuilder:</p>
<pre><code>import _elementtidy
t = ET.XML(_elementtidy.fixup(open(
       'dercuano-20191226/notes/nova-rdos.html').read(), 'utf8')[0])
</code></pre>
<p>...although that's not without ElementTidy, just without its Python.
It still has the namespace problem, though.</p>
<p>But the fixup() function there seems to just give us the stdout and
stderr we would get from invoking HTML Tidy.  Which, as it turns out,
has options <code>-ashtml</code> and <code>-utf8</code> that would probably do the right
thing here without saddling us with an <code>xmlns</code>.  I wonder if Python
tidylib has a way to get that?</p>
<p>This looks promising:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; xs = tidylib.tidy_document(
        open('dercuano-20191226/notes/nova-rdos.html').read(),
        {'input-encoding': 'utf8',
         'output-encoding': 'utf8',
         'output-html': True})
&gt;&gt;&gt; print xs[0][:1024].decode('utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>That <em>almost</em> works:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = ET.XML(xs[0])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 124, in XML
cElementTree.ParseError: undefined entity: line 16, column 43
</code></pre>
<p>It's complaining about <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>.</p>
<p>Well, can I use ElementTidy (or for that matter tidylib) in XML mode,
but just strip off the namespace tags?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = ET.fromstring(_elementtidy.fixup(
    open('dercuano-20191226/notes/nova-rdos.html').read(), 'utf8')[0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; def deprefix(tree):
...  for kid in tree:
...   deprefix(kid)
...  tree.tag = re.compile('{.*}').sub('', tree.tag)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; deprefix(t)
</code></pre>
<p>That seems to have worked!  And tweaking the tidylib recipe above (no
output-html, yes numeric-entities) allowed me to excise the
ElementTidy dependency.  So that's one out of six showstopper bugs
fixed.</p>
<h4><code>&lt;pre&gt;</code></h4>
<p>As MDN says about CSS "white-space: pre":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sequences of white space are preserved. Lines are only broken at
  newline characters in the source and at <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now I have a "font stack" which is separate from the element
stack and also a "current link" which is restored from the element
stack.  But now I'd need to have a "white-space" stack so that I
restore white-space to its <code>normal</code> value at the proper place.</p>
<p>I think a better alternative is to use the element stack to restore
elements of the current style, which can include link destination,
font-family, font-size, and white-space.  Then I can just pass the
current style to <code>render_text</code>.</p>
<p><code>white-space: pre</code> is simple to implement:</p>
<pre><code>#words = re.split('[ \n\r\t]+', text)
words = re.split('\n', text)

    if True or t[0].getX() + width &gt; max_x:
        newline(c, t, font)

    t[0].textOut(word)# + ' ')
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, I have that working.  Four showstopper bugs left: newlines after
bullets, the ET Book license, vertical positioning, and font cascade
fallbacks.</p>
<p>In the process, though, the PDF seems to have grown by about 700K and
become slower to display in some PDF viewers.  I suspect resetting the
font on every word may be causing this, so I'm going to try adding
another level of indirection so I can make an apples-to-apples test.</p>
<p>Indeed, without redundant font setting, it takes 4m37s of user time
and produces a 12.4 MB PDF, while with redundant font setting, it
takes 5m45s and produces a 12.9 MB PDF.  So the extra complexity to
avoid redundant font setting is worthwhile.</p>
<h3>2019-12-29</h3>
<p>Well, so, I revisited the code that emits textobjects, and I made it
emit a new textobject for every line, which can be positioned with
some appropriate Y-offset, and now I have the links actually over the
text they're supposed to be (except when a link splits across pages,
which is still a bug) although at the cost of an extra megabyte.  This
also enables me to eliminate the fudge-factor margin at page bottoms,
which cuts the book down to 3718 pages.</p>
<p>So, that's one more showstopper bug down, and so now it's down to
three remaining showstopper bugs: the missing ET Book license, the
newlines following bullets, and tofu.  I think FreeSerif and FreeMono
are reasonable fallback fonts, but I have to figure out how to do the
fallbacking in practice.</p>
<h4>Font cascades</h4>
<p>So, I've added FreeFont FreeSerif as a fallback font and added a bunch
of logic for font fallback.  I probably should add some kind of
regexp-based fast path for when all the characters in a word are in ET
Book, because it's noticeably slower, but it does seem to cover nearly
all the characters I use.  FreeSerif-Italic seems to be missing a
bunch of subscript letters I use, though, unless I'm screwing
something up.</p>
<p>It takes about 9 minutes instead of about 5 minutes to generate the
PDF now.</p>
<p>It turns out that subscript index letters like ₖ or <em>ₖ</em> (bold: <strong>ₖ</strong>,
bold italic: <em><strong>ₖ</strong></em>) are not in (this version of) FreeFont, but they
<em>are</em> in DejaVuSerif and DejaVuSerif-Italic.  They're used in <a href="../notes/isotropic-texture-effects.html">Isotropic nonlinear texture effects for letterforms from a scale-space representation</a> and <a href="../notes/observable-transaction-possibilities.html">Observable transaction possibilities</a>.
So I'm going to go ahead and add the relevant DejaVu fonts, including
for typewriter text (<code>ₖ</code>, <em><code>ₖ</code></em>, <em><strong><code>ₖ</code></strong></em>, <strong><code>ₖ</code></strong>), to the font
cascade.</p>
<p>That seems to solve the problem.  So maybe I can declare the Dercuano
PDF pipeline tofu-free, at the cost of dozens of megabytes of fonts
added to the source repository.</p>
<p>So, the remaining showstopper problems are the ET Book license and
newlines following bullets.  Then I can work on some problems that are
annoying but less critical, like subscripts and superscripts, page
numbers, blockquote formatting, ligatures, per-note tables of
contents, extra spaces, extra newlines in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, header colors, and
header padding.</p>
<p>(Although, as it turns out, I spent some time adding caches to the
font cascade code to see if I could make it a little less slow.  This
cut the PDF build time from 9.5 minutes to 8 minutes.)</p>
<h4>Newlines following bullets</h4>
<p>This happens with the construct <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;fulano&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>.  Entering
the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> causes one newline (followed by a bullet), and entering the
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> causes another.  The correct solution is to make the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> a box
vertically nested inside the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> box without any extra padding, so
that, unless there's something above it to push it down, their tops
are at the same position.  But the janky PDF generation script doesn't
have a box model; it just has newlines.  How could we avoid generating
a newline?</p>
<p>Well, the problem is specifically when a block element is the first
thing inside another block element.  So maybe I can just have a
boolean about whether we're at the top of a block.</p>
<p>Okay, I was able to hack that in, and as a bonus I can use it to
eliminate paragraph indents when paragraphs are the first thing inside
a block element.  That avoids list items having an indent on the first
line next to the bullet.  It will probably also help with blockquotes.
Gah, blockquotes.</p>
<p>That just leaves the ET Book license as a showstopper.</p>
<h3>2019-12-30</h3>
<p>No, wait, another one just popped up: in between the two 6's in
"m0oTzNujJpx 66\n" in the middle of powerful-primitives.html, the font
switches to italic, which it doesn't in the browser, and stays that
way for the rest of the note.  The culprit seems to be <code>m0oTzNujJpx
6&lt;I=EInw&gt;6\n</code>.  I tweaked this to use <code>``</code> in the Markdown,
which hopefully will make the problem go away, but even if it
interpreted that as an <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag, it should have at some point found
an end to it --- maybe Tidy worked too hard here...</p>
<p>Oh also I implemented <strong>bold</strong> as <code>typewriter</code> due to what looks like
a copy-and-paste error.  Fixed!</p>
<p>I've fixed another couple of problems mentioned earlier in a drive-by
fashion: <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> contents and no-break spaces.</p>
<p>So, the biggest remaining problems with the PDF, in more or less
priority order (a sort of mix of estimated effort with estimated
benefit):</p>
<ul>
<li>The link to the ET Book license is broken.</li>
<li>Headers don't have enough padding above them.</li>
<li>Links are not indicated in any printable way, so they're invisible in,
  for example, MuPDF.  Also, they don't have page numbers, even when they
  are internal links, so PDF viewers without link support (such as printers
  and Google Drive's PDF viewer, the default on Android) can't use them.</li>
<li>Overlong lines are cut off rather than wrapped.</li>
<li>Individual notes have no tables of contents.</li>
<li><code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> are not implemented.</li>
<li>Character-level markup like <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> produces spurious spaces.</li>
<li>Character-level markup inside <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> produces spurious newlines.</li>
<li>The notes are not in any particular order, but they should be in the
  roughly chronological order they are in the table of contents.</li>
<li>URL-encoded links are broken.</li>
<li>I haven't imported file <code>ceramics-notes</code>.</li>
<li>The PDF is humongous, 13.5 megabytes.</li>
<li>Tables aren't implemented.</li>
<li>Ordered lists <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> are bulleted rather than numbered.</li>
<li>Headers aren't red or underlined.</li>
<li>Line spacing is too tight.</li>
<li>Blockquotes aren't visibly distinct at all.</li>
<li>Text isn't hyphenated, justified, or ligated (even things like "fi"
  and "fl".)</li>
<li>SVG isn't implemented.</li>
<li>Sometimes there are spurious blank lines between paragraphs and list
  items.</li>
<li>Superscript 0 and 456789 are larger than superscript 123.</li>
<li>Fallback characters in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> have the wrong width.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a lot to fix in the next 22 hours and I'm definitely not going
to finish all of it, but I ought to be able to make a significant dent.</p>
<p>Okay, adding the ET Book license was a little harder than expected,
but done.</p>
<p>I sort of have the padding thing working.  It's not working for the
"Topics" section at the end because that's the first thing in a
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and my check for paragraphs in list items means that they
don't get a newline.  I guess I could make that specific to list
items.</p>
<p>Now I have the page numbers thing sort of working, although as with
LaTeX, page number references will only work the <em>second</em> time you
generate a document, which in some sense doubles the generation time
from 8 minutes to 16.  This is sort of alarming given that I have 20.5
hours left, which is 82 times 16 minutes.  I can only do 82 more full
rebuilds at that pace.  This code will only ever be run 82 more times,
ever.</p>
<p>How about overlong lines?  I could use a regular "\" to indicate the
wrapping of the line, although I think an outdented "-" would be nice.
But then I need to chop the overlong word up into lines somehow.  If I
were just positioning it at an (x, y), I feel like I could easily
enough position it a full column width to the left, but the textobject
seems to be taking care of positioning for me, unfortunately.  So
maybe a better option is to binary search on word widths.</p>
<p>Damn it, I just scalded my hand with this teakettle.  Not sure being
awake at 4 AM is such a good idea.  But I still have almost 20 hours
left.</p>
<p>All right, I have overlong lines chopped and marked with little
circles, sort of like flowchart connector circles.  And it's almost
sunrise, and damn is it hot, despite the air conditioner going full
blast.</p>
<p>Adding tables of contents with ElementTree shouldn't be rocket
science, but those tables of contents will be sort of lame without
bookmarks to jump to.  So I'd need to add a bookmark for each header,
which I might as well try to add to the document's outline as well;
actually with some PDF viewers that would be a sufficient navigational
interface.</p>
<p>However, the 1300 or so outline items are already a bit of a problem
for many PDF viewers; I'm not sure how well they'll handle another
order of magnitude.  I may put this off for a few hours and work on
other problems.</p>
<p>Superscript and subscript are supposedly implemented by
reportlab.pdfgen.textobject.setRise.  That can be made to
work... although line breaking between a base and the exponent is
possible and pretty undesirable.  Also it seems like the line spacing
below increases for a superscript and decreases for a subscript, which
is pretty bogus; this very note has some trouble with that with the
word "T<sub>E</sub>X".  This is maybe enough of an implementation for
the moment --- now it's a formatting problem instead of a semantic
problem --- but it sucks pretty bad.</p>
<p>Sunrise is well underway, though the streetlights have not yet gone
out.</p>
<p>The character-level markup problem is because the way words get
separated in the document is that every word gets a space appended to
it, regardless of whether what followed it was a space, the element
end, or an element beginning.  Originally I was using <code>words =
text.split()</code> but now that I'm using <code>re.split</code> this problem should
actually be easy to fix:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; re.split(r'[ \t]+', 'a b')
['a', 'b']
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.split(r'[ \t]+', 'a b ')
['a', 'b', '']
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.split(r'[ \t]+', ' a b ')
['', 'a', 'b', '']
</code></pre>
<p>So, I only want to append a space if the word is not the last word in
the string.</p>
<p>This small change yields an enormous improvement in formatting.  I was
whispering, "Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck," as I looked at the
results.  Exponents are better (in, <em>e.g.</em>, <a href="../notes/adaptive-hill-climbing.html">Robust local search in vector spaces using adaptive step sizes, and thoughts on extending quasi-Newton methods</a>); formulas with italic letters are better
(for example, <a href="../notes/adaptive-hill-climbing.html">Robust local search in vector spaces using adaptive step sizes, and thoughts on extending quasi-Newton methods</a>'s presentation of the law
of cosines); inline typewriter text is better (in, <em>e.g.</em>, <a href="../notes/escheme.html">Eur-Scheme: a simplified Ur-Scheme</a>, though it still has major problems with <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>); italic
words in paragraphs are better; links are better.</p>
<p>A similar but somewhat larger change fixed the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> problem in
<a href="../notes/escheme.html">Eur-Scheme: a simplified Ur-Scheme</a>, although now I am getting to the point where I am surprised
when some code works, which is probably a danger sign that I'm
introducing bugs.  It's now light enough outside that the streetlights
have gone out, though there is still no direct sunlight.  Maybe I
should sleep for a while if I can manage it; I have almost 18 hours
left in the day.</p>
<p>I also just tweaked the link boxes to go 0.1 ems to the right as well
as 0.1 ems to the left of the link text, and tried URL-decoding URLs
to fix the problems with links to <a href="../notes/lua-%2523-operator.html">Improving Lua #L with incremental prefix sum in the ∧ monoid</a> and <a href="../notes/%25241-recognizer-diagrams.html">$1 recognizer diagrams</a>, which seems to have worked.</p>
<p>So, now that I've solved the above eight problems, that leaves the
following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual notes have no tables of contents.</li>
<li>The notes are not in any particular order, but they should be in the
  roughly chronological order they are in the table of contents.</li>
<li>Blockquotes aren't visibly distinct at all.</li>
<li>Superscript and subscript screw up the line spacing.  One of the worst
  examples is on the second page of <a href="../notes/sdf-notes.html">Some thoughts on SDF raymarching</a>, which is totally
  unreadable.  The beginning of <a href="../notes/diesel-electrolysis.html">Why you can't run a diesel engine on water and diesel fuel with electrolysis</a> also has a somewhat
  less egregious example.</li>
<li>I haven't imported file <code>ceramics-notes</code>.</li>
<li>The PDF is humongous, 16 megabytes.</li>
<li>Tables aren't implemented.</li>
<li>Ordered lists <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> are bulleted rather than numbered.</li>
<li>Headers aren't red or underlined.</li>
<li>Line spacing is too tight.</li>
<li>Text isn't hyphenated, justified, or ligated (even things like "fi"
  and "fl".)</li>
<li>SVG isn't implemented.  (It's only used in <a href="../notes/dercuano-drawings.html">Dercuano drawings</a>
  and <a href="../notes/mechano-optical-vector-display.html">A mechano-optical vector display for animation archival</a>, so translating the seven
  or so diagrams manually into PDF paths and operations might be a
  reasonable option.)</li>
<li>Sometimes there are spurious blank lines between paragraphs and list
  items.</li>
<li>Unicode superscript 0 and 456789 are larger than superscript 123.</li>
<li>Fallback characters in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> have the wrong width.</li>
<li>Superscripts and subscripts don't nest; see <a href="../notes/dercuano-stylesheet-notes.html">Dercuano stylesheet notes</a>
  in the first example of superscripts to see an egregious error.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm pretty pleased with how the result looks now, actually, although
there are still clearly places where it does the wrong thing.</p>
<h4>After sleeping</h4>
<p>I slept 6 hours and now have 10 hours left.</p>
<p>I tried an optimization that turned out to slow things down by 10%,
that of handling word spaces separately from the words.  I hacked in a
reasonable approximation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_sentence_spacing#French_and_English_spacing">English spacing, in the sense of larger
spaces after
sentences</a>:
colons, periods, exclamation marks, and question marks get a
double-sized space after them, except when it's a period at the end of
an abbreviation.  (In particular, an extra space is added after
ordinals in sequences like "1. Ready. 2. Set. 3. Go!")</p>
<p>This is a small change, but I think it improves nearly every
paragraph, even though there are still much worse problems than the
use of French equal sentence spacing throughout the book.</p>
<p>It would probably work better to use the indication of double spaces
(or newlines) after periods in the original Markdown, since I'm pretty
consistent about doing that, but, bleh.</p>
<p>So, what next?  I think I should see if any of the next three items
turn out to be relatively yielding: individual-note tables of
contents, ordering of notes, and blockquote formatting.</p>
<p>I was thinking as I went to sleep that hanging indents (as are
conventional for bulleted lists) should be relatively easy to handle:
add a property to the style that has a string to place before each new
line, and set it to a few spaces.  This is a crude approximation of
proper indentation for bulleted lists, but it might be adequate, and
in particular for blockquotes.  This does not exist as a CSS
stylesheet property, except in the sense that <code>margin-left</code>, or
<code>padding-left</code> can be used to indent the contents of a block with
whitespace, and <code>text-indent</code> can be used to give the first line of
each paragraph an extra indent.</p>
<p>An absolute minimum thing to do for blockquote formatting is to reduce
the font size, and that's easy, so I'll do that.</p>
<p>Hmm, not quite so easy, because I haven't implemented font inheritance
for block elements, so paragraphs inside a blockquote don't inherit
the font.  So I implemented font inheritance for block elements.</p>
<p>Also I added <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> back as block elements, causing them to
have space at the top, so that the quoted lists in <a href="../notes/flexures.html">Flexures</a>
don't collide with the headers right above them.</p>
<p>Oh!  I think I know how to fix the subscript/superscript problem.  I
just need to do the opposite setRise before setRise(0), because
the implementation of setRise in Reportlab adds an increment to
<code>self._y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def setRise(self, rise):
    "Move text baseline up or down to allow superscrip/subscripts"
    self._rise = rise
    self._y = self._y - rise    # + ?  _textLineMatrix?
    self._code.append('%s Ts' % fp_str(rise))
</code></pre>
<p>So, when we restore the rise back to zero, we need to also restore
<code>_y</code>.  So if we previously did setRise(6) we should do setRise(-6)
before setRise(0).  Well, that will work for the simple case of 0;
what if the rise was previously 2?  We don't want setRise(2) to result
in an additional 2 points of displacement for <code>_y</code>.  So we should do
setRise(-8) before setRise(2).  So, I got that fixed, although
sometimes the fix does the wrong thing when it restores the rise on a
different line.</p>
<p>Hmm, "<em>Pₒᵤₜ</em>" looks like shit maybe because of inconsistent font
fallbacks; it's the same problem as the superscript digits.</p>
<p>Okay, so with those fixes, I have 6 hours left.  But my network on
this netbook has failed, so I'm going to reboot.</p>
<p>Now I've pushed out that update and am asking for other people to look
at it.</p>
<p>Sean B. Palmer suggested tweaking the link box locations so they don't
cut through character descenders, so I've done that.</p>
<p>So, back to the list of known problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual notes have no tables of contents.</li>
<li>The notes are not in any particular order, but they should be in the
  roughly chronological order they are in the table of contents.</li>
<li>I haven't imported file <code>ceramics-notes</code>.</li>
<li>The PDF is humongous, 16.8 megabytes.</li>
<li>Tables aren't implemented.</li>
<li>Blockquotes and list items aren't indented.</li>
<li>Ordered lists <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> are bulleted rather than numbered.</li>
<li>Headers aren't red or underlined.</li>
<li>Headers have no bottom margins.</li>
<li>Line spacing is too tight, especially at the tops of blockquoted
  paragraphs.</li>
<li>Superscript and subscript screw up the line spacing when they are
  broken across lines.</li>
<li>Text isn't hyphenated, justified, or ligated (even things like "fi"
  and "fl".)</li>
<li>SVG isn't implemented.  (It's only used in <a href="../notes/dercuano-drawings.html">Dercuano drawings</a>
  and <a href="../notes/mechano-optical-vector-display.html">A mechano-optical vector display for animation archival</a>, so translating the seven
  or so diagrams manually into PDF paths and operations might be a
  reasonable option.)</li>
<li>Sometimes there are spurious blank lines between paragraphs and list
  items.</li>
<li>Unicode superscript 0 and 456789 are larger than superscript 123.</li>
<li>Fallback characters in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> have the wrong width.</li>
<li>Superscripts and subscripts don't nest correctly; see <a href="../notes/dercuano-stylesheet-notes.html">Dercuano stylesheet notes</a> in the first example of superscripts to
  see an egregious error.</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest thing for the chronological order would be to get the
note links themselves from the table of contents.  That might not be
too hard.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem to be too hard, but I think I need to discriminate
local, relative links from absolute links.  A quick and dirty approach
there is just <code>urlparse(relative_url).path.startswith('/')</code>, although
there's probably like an <code>is_relative</code> property or something
somewhere, I dunno.  And now the PDF is in the proper order.</p>
<p>Although it seems like I have an URL-encoding problem still; my links
to the topic "español" are broken, but I'd never noticed until the PDF
generation croaked on it.  Gotta regenerate the HTML!</p>
<p>Okay, adding colors to headers wasn't that hard either, although
there's some kind of problem with the color's alpha --- it's not
applied to the first line of the header, just the second and
subsequent lines.</p>
<p>While I was at it, I spent five minutes hacking in a font-size hack
for <a href="../notes/big-if-true.html">Things in Dercuano that would be big if true</a>, and then added a little top margin to
paragraphs and made <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> elements bold.  And I started writing a
postscriptum for Dercuano.</p>
<p>All right, I have two hours left, so I guess I need to accept most of
the above problems now, and only fix things if I find something
egregious.</p>
<p>I see <a href="../notes/iterative-string-formatting.html">Iterative string formatting</a> has some Devanagari tofu in
it.  Apparently my font cascades lack Devanagari in the
typewriter-font cascade.  That's too bad.  (Maybe it's actually
mojibake, because the Devanagari is showing up as Chinese!)  <a href="../notes/magnetoresistive-relay.html">Steampunk spintronics: magnetoresistive relay logic?</a> has an extra space in "F.B. Morse".  Too bad.
It also has an extra space in "(i.e. 250ps", which I think I'll fix;
even though the "i.e." should be followed by a comma, I've made that
error in many notes.  APL <code>⍴</code> in <a href="../notes/typed-apl.html">APL with typed indices</a> produces tofu, but
only in the serif font (I guess it's missing from the cascade); too
bad.</p>
<p>The title of <a href="../notes/byte-stream-gui-applications.html">Byte-stream GUI applications</a> was wrong; fixed.</p>
<p>In <a href="../notes/nova-rdos.html">Nova RDOS</a> there is tofu; I think this is because it's mostly
encoded with CRLFs but occasionally has a lone LF.  I'm not sure how
this ends up producing tofu in the PDF but it does.  Oh, yes I do.  My
<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> pattern didn't handle blank lines correctly; fixed.  Linking
it in the intro text is making it appear out of sequence, which is too
bad I guess.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/cheap-frequency-detection.html">Cheap frequency detection</a> has some array indices that are
incorrectly formatted as links; fixed, I hope.</p>
<p>I've switched to just using the normal line-wrapping code for
formatting text files (in particular, the font licenses).</p>
<p>I guess that's about it!</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/politics.html">Politics</a> (39 notes)
