(8 minutes)</div><p>There were common non-inverting logic families in the past, an idea
that always appealed to me in my childhood, since burning power in
every logic gate seemed wasteful.  (I didn’t understand how much it
simplified the process of digital design.)  Diode logic and threshold
logic (McCulloch-Pitts neurons without inhibitory inputs) are two
rough families, although they are at different levels of abstraction.</p>
<h2>Circuits whose combinational logic is non-inverting</h2>
<p>A typical way to manage this, e.g. in Stan Frankel’s 1956 <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2019/lgp-30">LGP-30</a>, was
to do the combinational logic with diode logic, then the registers
with flip-flops which generated two-rail outputs, i.e. both Q and Q̄.
A flip-flop at the time was a pair of cross-coupled vacuum tubes and a
pair of resistors, as I understand it.  (The apparent design rationale
for the 1958 Сетунь, wanting to use a smaller number of
flip-flop-flaps rather than a larger number of flip-flops, makes me
think this kind of thing was universal at the time.)</p>
<p>The LGP-30-style design combines the functions of amplification,
signal level restoration, inversion, glitch elimination, and memory in
a single device, the flip-flop.</p>
<p>In case it’s not clear how this works: absent restrictions on fan-outs
and fan-ins, you can always reduce the combinational logic to this
form as follows.  Register all the inputs through flip-flops; convert
the desired logical formula into sum-of-products form (disjunctive
normal form), i.e. ∨ᵢ∧ⱼXᵢⱼ where each Xᵢⱼ is either 1, an input
variable Qₖ, or a negated input variable Q̄ₖ; run all the flip-flop
outputs, both negated and non-negated, down the columns of your
schematic; convert each ∧ⱼXᵢⱼ into a row that is a many-input AND gate
taking its inputs from those columns; and finally combine all the rows
with a many-input OR gate.  You can think of this as a kind of binary
matrix-multiplication operation, where the bits of the resulting
vector are the inputs of the final OR gate, which computes the Boolean
norm† of that vector.</p>
<p>Note that both AND and OR gates are non-inverting, and here you only
need two levels of them, so this is a feasible design to realize in
unamplified diode logic.  It may be possible to do better, since in
many cases the inflation factor of reducing a formula to a sum of
products is large, but it guarantees that it is always possible.</p>
<p>This kind of thing seems appealing to me somehow even in the world of
MOSFETs: an N-channel enhancement-mode‡ MOSFET with a weak pulldown
resistor can be thought of as an AND gate where a low-impedance
connection to Vdd counts as “1”, no such low-impedance connection
counts as “0”, and no low-impedance paths to Vss exist.  With these
conventions, an OR is just a wired connection, and the circuit depth
problems imposed by diode voltage drops go away.  Presumably people
have thought of this, but this approach isn’t widely used, maybe
because the pulldowns are slow to discharge the gates unless they’re
burning a lot of power normally.  (I thought this might be what is
called “pass transistor logic”, but that turns out to be a different
but related approach.)</p>
<h2>Circuits whose combinational and also sequential logic is non-inverting</h2>
<p>It wasn’t until I was rereading Merkle’s 1990 buckling-spring paper
“Two types of mechanical reversible logic” today that I understood
that the sum-of-products thing generalizes to cases where your memory
elements don’t do inversion.  He makes a casual aside about how
Landauer in previous work had assumed dual-rail logic, where each
value computed is accompanied by its complement, so negation is
obtained simply by switching the two.</p>
<p>The Landauer reference is found in his “Dissipation and noise immunity
in computation and communication”, on p.781 of Nature, Vol. 335:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In these schemes we use majority logic to do computation.  There is
an odd number of inputs (typically three) to a given [potential
energy] well.  The well under consideration then gets set according
to the majority vote of the stages exerting an influence on it.  If,
for example, we have one input set at zero, with the other two
inputs being variable, we get a ‘1’ output [iff] both of the
variable inputs are ‘1’.  In this scheme we cannot perform a
negation directly.  Therefore, we need dual rail logic, in which we
carry along a variable and its complement, and perform negation by
interchanging the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a brilliant revelation to me: it means that you don’t need
negation <em>inside</em> the system <em>at all</em>, even in memory; you only need
to generate the complements of signals <em>on input</em> to the system.  That
is, the feature of flip-flops that they automatically generate
complements on every registered bit is completely dispensable, at the
cost of twice as much logic, more or less.</p>
<p>This is achieved through simple De Morgan conversion: to compute
~(XY), you compute ~X | ~Y, and to compute ~(X | Y), you merely
compute ~X &amp; ~Y, where the operators are as in C.</p>
<p>Consider a basic inverting function which is necessary for binary
addition, XOR: X⊕Y ≡ XȲ + X̄Y.  In this dual-rail scheme, you can
compute it in just that way, and then, if necessary, its complement,
XNOR, as (X̄ + Y)(X + Ȳ).  This requires six AND and OR gates, but
calculating it with NAND requires four gates, and calculating the
complement requires five (with, e.g., ((B|B)|(A|A))|(B|A), where <code>|</code>
is now the Sheffer stroke denoting NAND rather than the C bitwise OR.)</p>
<p>In a dual-rail system with absolutely no inversion inside the
system — only inversion at inputs — you may need more register bits
than you would need in a system in which only the combinational logic
is noninverting, since you (often) have to register both a bit and its
complement, while a conventional flip-flop will generate one from the
other.</p>
<h2>Further extensions</h2>
<p>The dual-rail system can be thought of as a one-hot encoding with two
possible values.  It is straightforward to mix dual-rail signals with
one-hot signals of other multiplicities, including the Сетунь’s three
but also four and even five and higher, as in the biquinary encoding
used in the IBM 650 Knuth learned to program on; this may afford
economies of logic under many circumstances, as the aforementioned
Boolean matrix becomes much sparser.</p>
<p>For e</p>
<p>Note that Landauer’s suggested family of approaches performs level
restoration at every gate, rather than leaving that up to the
flip-flops, and thus doesn’t suffer the severe limitations on
combinational circuit depth that diode logic did.  Circuit depth is
still a crucial factor for clock speeds, though.  (And the escape from
this, asynchronous logic, coincidentally also typically depends on
dual-rail logic...)</p>
<hr />
<p>† I say “the Boolean norm of that vector” because I think that N-way
bitwise OR is the only non-constant function that satisfies the
definition of a norm ((g ≠ 0 ⇒ ν(g) &gt; 0) ∧ ν(g + h) ≤ ν(g) + ν(h) ∧ (g
∈ ℤ ⇒ ν(mg) = |m|ν(g))) , under the usual interpretations: AND for
multiplication, OR for addition, 0 for false, 1 for true, and 0 &lt; 1.</p>
<p>‡ You could use a P-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET as an AND-NOT
(abjunction or negated implication) gate, which provides a limited
form of negation: it will only let through a low-impedance connection
to the positive power rail if the gate is pulled low, meaning that the
gate has no such connection.  Abjunction is as universal as NAND if
you have access to a constant 1, but it’s falsehood-preserving: any
circuit made of abjunction gates will have output 0 if all its inputs
are 0.  Worse (for use as a NAND-like universal gate, anyway, though
not in this context) is the fact that you can’t build an OR gate out
of abjunctions without access to that constant 1, even though the OR
gate is also falsehood-preserving.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
