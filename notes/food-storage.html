(54 minutes)</div><h2>Storing food at home</h2>
<p>A related post, <a href="../notes/constant-factor-worse.html">Only a constant factor worse</a>, discussed a
food-buying strategy that would give you an unboundedly-expanding
stored-food supply, as long as you're spending more than about US$0.64
per day (US$234/year) on food, and advocated doing so if you're poor,
for several reasons: you can buy food only when it's on sale or free,
you can buy food in bulk for better prices, and you can keep a wide
variety of food on hand to avoid dangerous dietary monotony.  Even if
you accept that it would be a good idea, it's reasonable to ask how
you can practically store such a stockpile.</p>
<p>First off, let's cap the stockpile at a year's supply.  Not even the
Mormons store up more than a year's supply of food; many people just
store up 72 hours' worth for disaster-preparedness.  So let's not even
consider the possibility of storing two, five, or ten years' worth of
food.</p>
<p>Second, let's consider how much space we can reasonably use.  I think
it's reasonable to dedicate some constant fraction of your living
space to food storage, not too much.  If 25% of your house is full of
stored food, it's likely to significantly diminish your quality of
life.  Let's figure 6.25% as a reasonable upper limit.</p>
<p>Would you suffer a lot if your house were 6.25% smaller?  The smallest
house I've lived in was a Volkswagen Vanagon camper bus, which was
about two meters by four meters by one and a half meters (although you
could put the top up to get a ceiling of over two meters in part of
the bus when you were stopped).  Getting at daily-use stuff was
trivially easy; it was almost always within arm's reach.  Getting at
more specialized stuff (tools for putting the damn muffler back on
again, say) required reconfiguring the furniture, which was kind of a
pain.</p>
<p>That was 12 cubic meters of space.  6.25% of it would be
three-quarters of a cubic meter, which was about the size of the
humongous toolbox we lugged around to fix the thing.  Another
three-quarters of a cubic meter would have been feasible, but it would
have blocked the back windshield; we would have had to put it on the
floor when driving or sleeping, and in the bed space when we needed
the floor.  That is, we could have done it, but it would have been a
pain.</p>
<p>However, if your house contains 12¾ cubic meters, you can damn well
spare those extra three-quarters of a cubic meter for food storage.
If that's useful, which it is, and if it's necessary, which as we'll
see, it isn't.</p>
<p>The apartment I'm living in at the moment has a living room, a
kitchen, a bathroom, and a storage room, which was intended as the
bedroom but has a weird mold smell, so I don't want to sleep in it.  I
basically live in the living room, which is about four meters by six
meters by three meters tall, a total of 72 cubic meters, six times the
size of the Vanagon.  6.25% of this would be 4.5 cubic meters; if it's
vertical to the ceiling, it would be 1.5 square meters; along the
four-meter-long wall, it would shorten the six meters of the room by
38 centimeters.  Eminently livable.  How much food can you store in
4.5 cubic meters?</p>
<p>In that related post, I was talking about foods like flour, polenta,
brown rice, soybeans, salt, and sunflower oil, with total consumption
between 600g and 700g per day.  These have somewhat varying densities,
but they're generally around the density of water: 1kg/ℓ, or one tonne
per cubic meter.  Which means you can store about four or five tonnes
of food in 4.5 cubic meters.  That would be about 19 years' worth!</p>
<p>In fact, storing 650 grams of dry food per day, a year's worth of food
is only 237 kg.  That's not even the three-quarters of a cubic meter
that would be 6.25% of the Vanagon.  It's more like <em>one</em> quarter of a
cubic meter.</p>
<h3>Lifetime and spoilage</h3>
<p>This brings us to the problem of the lifetime of stored food.  If you
just buy bags of food and pile it up in a corner, you will not have a
food stockpile that eliminates risks to your food budget; you will
have a serious vermin infestation, maybe a mold problem, and probably
a lot of expired food.  Plus, if you have to move, you'll have one
more heavy thing to bring with you.  At different times and in
different places, I've had to cope with cockroaches, rancid oil,
weevils, red flour beetles (or confused flour beetles), and moths in
my food.  This is where I explain how you can make sure you never have
these problems.</p>
<p>I know nine basic strategies for managing the limited-food-lifetime
problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotation: first in, first out.</li>
<li>Hermetic sealing.</li>
<li>Vermin-proof packaging.</li>
<li>Cold.</li>
<li>Dehydration.</li>
<li>Darkness.</li>
<li>Chemical preservation.</li>
<li>Sterility.</li>
<li>Liveness.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rotation</h4>
<p>Things like rice are typically guaranteed good for 18 months from
packaging.  Even unopened, unrefrigerated mayonnaise is guaranteed
good for nine months.  So if you consume your rice within 18 months of
buying it, you're all good.  But that means that, if you open up the
pantry and pick between a two-month-old bag and a 17-month-old
container of rice, you'd better pick the 17-month-old one.  Otherwise,
it's going to expire before you finish the last one.</p>
<p>This is known as "proper stock rotation" or "first in, first out" in
business.  You need to mark each item you have in stock with a date
(either its date of origin or its date of expiration) and always use
the oldest item.</p>
<p>That means that, if you manage to work your way up to a one-year
stockpile, you'll always be eating year-old food.  The alternative is
to keep buying more food than you need and just throw out the year-old
food, wasting it.</p>
<p>You can mark items in lots of ways.  I like to use polyester cloth
ribbon, tied around the necks of bottles, marked in ballpoint pen.  It
looks pretty, it's easy to read, it's easy to make, and it's pretty
cheap.</p>
<h4>Hermetic sealing</h4>
<p>Most spoilage problems are caused by stuff getting into food from the
outside: moisture, bugs, or in the case of rancidity, mere oxygen.  So
to keep your food from spoiling, it helps a lot to keep it
hermetically sealed.  Historically, this was really difficult, and
that was a major cause of food spoilage.  Now, there are lots of ways
to do this: heat-sealed bags, cans, jars with hermetically-sealing
tops, Ziploc bags, bottles with corks, and my favorite, screw-top
soft-drink bottles.</p>
<p>Screw-top bottles typically have a soft plastic gasket on the inside
of the screw-top lid, which the thread compresses against the top of
the bottle neck.  This seal must be sufficiently airtight to keep the
soft drink from going flat.  Some, but not all, bottled-water bottles
are inferior.  You can test a candidate bottle by filling it with
water and freezing it, which will stretch the bottle and put the
contents under a lot of pressure; if the bottlecap doesn't seal well,
the last of the water will be forced out and drip past the cap,
forming an icicle in your freezer.</p>
<p>One thing to beware of is that hermetic sealing means that odors and
contamination won't have a chance to dissipate.  This means that if
your hermetic container is leaching stuff into your food, it will
build up, rather than bubbling out.  This is why "tin cans"
traditionally were coated in tin and nowadays are coated in plastic:
to keep the steel from ending up in the food.  Soft-drink bottles
probably won't leach anything toxic into your food (they don't contain
bisphenol-A, and the concerns about leaching of antimony-based
catalysts have not proven out so far) but they might make it taste
like Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Oxygen rancidifies oils and helps to spoil beer (I think by souring
it), and most plastics are fairly permeable to oxygen, including the
polyethylene terephthalate used for soft-drink bottles and the
polyethylene and polypropylene used for most plastic bags.  This is
the major reason that beer has not been sold in plastic bottles until
recently.  Some new formulations of polyethylene terephthalate include
a bentonite clay filler to dramatically reduce their oxygen
permeability, which has made it possible for plastic-bottled beer to
keep.  I have no idea how to tell if you have such a bottle.  Multiple
layers of enclosure, perhaps including a layer that's not plastic, may
be a useful way to reduce oxygen permeability.</p>
<p>Latex condoms --- preferably unlubricated --- or gloves may provide a
useful level of additional sealing for storage that you don't expect
to open and close repeatedly.  They have the advantage that they can
be stored in very little space when empty.</p>
<h4>Vermin-proof packaging</h4>
<p>You can have a container that's hermetically sealed but not
vermin-proof.  In particular, weevils and flour beetles can tunnel
through even fairly thick polyethylene plastic bags, so if one bag in
a pile is infested, they will eventually colonize the other bags.  So
far, I haven't had them chew through soft-drink bottles.  (This is one
of the reasons soft-drink bottles are my favorite.)  I'm sure they
can't chew through ceramic, glass, or metal.</p>
<p>Some varieties of cockroaches can chew through wood, so wood may not
be a good choice for vermin-proof packaging.  It's hard to get wood to
seal hermetically anyway.</p>
<p>The Anasazi had a kind of container called a "seed pot" which was
vermin-proof but not hermetically sealed.  It was a small pot with a
tiny hole on top --- maybe 2mm in diameter --- to fill it with dried
seeds.  Apparently the vermin they had to deal with were mostly mice,
not flour beetles, and mice are far too big to get in through such a
hole.  You break the pot to get access to the seeds.</p>
<p>Mice and rats will not have much trouble chewing through soft-drink
bottles, I think, so if you have to deal with them, it might be a good
idea to keep your soft-drink bottles inside something mouse-proof,
like a metal box.</p>
<p>Because your food might already have vermin in it when you put it into
storage, it's a good idea to have at least one level of vermin-proof
packaging that's fairly small, say, around a kilogram or so.  It would
be a real shame if the progeny of two tiny flour beetles were able to
spoil 20 kilograms of your stored-up flour.  The Anasazi seed pots
held about 100 grams.  I typically use soft-drink bottles of 1½
liters, although I occasonally use 2¼ℓ and 3ℓ bottles too.</p>
<h4>Cold</h4>
<p>Most kinds of spoilage follow the Arrhenius law, increasing
exponentially with temperature; so dropping the temperature even a few
degrees can slow a spoilage process to the point where it's
effectively stopped --- where it won't proceed to the point of
mattering by the time you eat the food.  This also means that what
matters is not the <em>average</em> temperature at which food is stored, but
the <em>maximum</em> temperature, so simply reducing the size of temperature
variations will extend the lifetime of food.</p>
<p>Refrigerators, of course, are the most ubiquitous manifestation of
this storage strategy in the modern world, but wine cellars are
another.  Deep-freezes --- large, low-temperature freezers that open
on top rather than to the side --- are among the most effective ways
of storing food.</p>
<p>I've speculated in the past on kragen-tol about using a superinsulated
icebox in place of a refrigerator, and have actually done some
experiments with freezing two soft-drink two-liter bottles of water in
a freezer and transferring them daily to a 2cm-thick styrofoam cooler
in the Buenos Aires summer.  Heat leakage was enough to melt about one
of them per day.  This suggests that 10 or 20 centimeters of
styrofoam, or twice that of straw, would be sufficient to give you a
low-cost major expansion of your refrigerator capacity, at the cost of
transferring ice bottles once or a few times a week.</p>
<p>I also recently did some calculations about using a drying-closet to
evaporatively cool air to near the wet-bulb temperature, using the
temperature change of the air to drive a constant airflow down a
cold-air drain, thus accelerating the drying process.  Preliminary
psychrometric-table consultations suggest that this could lower the
temperature of whatever is below the drain by some 5 degrees under
ordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>A pot-in-pot evaporative cooler design won some design awards a few
years back.  Basically you fill the space between an inner terra-cotta
pot and an outer terra-cotta pot with sand, and you keep the sand damp
with a watering can so that the inner pot remains at the wet-bulb
temperature.  This doesn't keep things as cold as an actual
refrigerator --- and in humid places it doesn't do much at all --- but
in many circumstances it can preserve food substantially longer than
nothing.</p>
<h4>Dehydration</h4>
<p>Dehydrating food for storage has some drawbacks --- the flavor and
texture changes, and in most food, not for the better; you typically
need to rehydrate it to cook it; and it can be labor-intensive, since
only occasionally will food dehydrate without human intervention.
Usually you have to spread it out, perhaps cut it into slices, perhaps
warm it up, and perhaps drive airflow over it.  On the other hand, it
dramatically reduces the mass of food, making it more portable; and
only a very few kinds of spoilage can attack dry food: rancidity, of
course; weevils, flour beetles, and moths, which can get sufficient
water by digesting its carbohydrates; and large vermin such as mice
and rats, which I fortunately have never yet had to deal with, can
drink water elsewhere and then eat your food.</p>
<p>Lack of proper dehydration for storage is a major risk factor for
cancer, because aflatoxin-producing molds will infest grains and
legumes that are stored insufficiently dry.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that, once vermin have infested food,
they tend to moisten it.  Flour beetles and weevils are not, in
themselves, toxic, although flour beetles do produce nasty flavors ---
but if present in sufficiently high quantities, they will moisten the
remaining food enough that it will spoil soon, even if you kill them.
(Some people think they add protein to the food, but they do not.
They probably do slightly increase the protein fraction of the food,
but by reducing its carbohydrate content, not by increasing its
protein content.  Animals, such as humans and confused flour beetles,
do not produce protein.  We must get it from our food.)</p>
<p>Some foods have a hard, dry shell protecting a tasty inner core, such
as nuts, flax seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds (unshelled), and so
on.  This only works as long as the outer shell remains dry.</p>
<p>I speculate that empanadas and their kin in other lands originally
gained popularity in part because of long shelf life.  The surface of
the empanada is completely dry when you finish cooking it, and it's
impregnated with oil to keep it from moistening from either within or
without.  The interior, having just been cooked thoroughly, is
sterile.  I suspect that an unpunctured empanada, especially of the
fried type, would have a shelf life measured in weeks or months if you
can keep vermin off of it, but I have not yet dared to do the
experiment.</p>
<h4>Darkness</h4>
<p>A few kinds of spoilage are caused by exposure to light, especially
ultraviolet light.  Potatoes exposed to light will produce potentially
deadly levels of solanine and turn green; beer exposed to light will
sour faster; and I think oils exposed to light will rancidify faster.
Refrigerators conveniently provide darkness, but other kinds of
enclosures may also be useful.  And, of course, light produces heat,
which can dispel cold and accelerate spoilage.</p>
<p>Even a cardboard box with holes in it can provide useful levels of
darkness.</p>
<h4>Chemical preservation</h4>
<p>Aside from the obvious and noxious chemical preservation methods,
using nitrites, sulfites, formaldehyde, and so on, we have jellying,
salting, pickling, alkaline preservation, spicing, and antioxidants
--- methods which were more ubiquitous before the advent of
refrigeration, but which still extend food lifetimes in concert with
refrigeration.</p>
<p>Jelly, jam, syrup, and preserves have too much sugar for much life to
survive in them, although they can sometimes grow mold on their
surface, where perhaps condensation locally reduced the relative sugar
content.  I think this kind of preservation works by reducing the
osmotic pressure to the point that any invading microorganisms are
sucked dry.  (Unlike with my stores of beans, rice, legumes, flour,
and spices, I've never had an insect infestation in my sugar; the most
that happens is that ants may come to carry it back to their anthill,
grain by grain.)</p>
<p>Salting works similarly, by reducing osmotic pressure.  Thus both
jellying and salting work synergetically with dehydration ---
dehydration reduces the salt or sugar needed, and salt or sugar
reduces the dehydration needed, to reach a given level of longevity.</p>
<p>Mayonnaise is, in part, a way to pickle eggs so they can last for
months without refrigeration; and many vegetables can be enjoyed for
months or years by pickling them, producing an environment too acid
for bacteria to grow in.</p>
<p>Alkaline preservation is not as widely used, but, for instance, from
the stench, I think thousand-year eggs are preserved with ammonia, and
lutefisk, also notoriously stinky, is preserved and softened with lye.</p>
<p>Many spices are poisonous enough to retard food spoilage.  Capsaicin,
which makes chile peppers hot, is also a fungicide; and cloves and bay
leaves, among others, are sufficiently poisonous to discourage many
kinds of spoilage-causing organisms.</p>
<p>Antioxidants such as BHA, BHT, and vitamins A, C, and E (IIRC) can
slow down rancidification dramatically, even in the presence of ample
oxygen.  Palm and camellia oils supposedly have very long shelf lives
in part because of their high levels of naturally present
antioxidants.  I don't know if you can use this property of theirs to
impart longer shelf lives to other prepared foods.  (Nitrites, I
think, are antioxidants too, which is why they keep preserved meat
pink.  But, in meat, they generate carcinogenic nitrosamines, and the
consumption of nitrite-containing meat is associated with a
significantly higher risk of stomach cancer, so I don't think the risk
is worth it.)</p>
<h4>Sterility</h4>
<p>Many food spoilage problems are caused by life forms, like beetles,
bacteria, or fungi; some other food health problems are caused by the
survival of parasites in the food.  Contrary to the medieval and
earlier hypothesis of spontaneous generation, if these life forms are
initially absent from the food and have no opportunity to get into it,
they will never be present, and the food will never experience that
kind of spoilage.  (It might still get eaten by rats or go rancid.)</p>
<p>So ensuring that the food contains no spoilage-causing life forms is
one way to prevent it from spoiling.  This is, of course, the main
thrust of canning: you cook the can thoroughly after sealing it.
Approaches other than cooking include irradiation (sadly, not
practical to do at home) and deep-freezing.  If you have a small
number of weevils or other beetles in your flour or rice or whatever,
freezing it for a couple of days can be sufficient to kill them.  (If
you have a large number, you may still want to freeze the container
before you throw it out, to keep them from spreading from it.)</p>
<h4>Liveness</h4>
<p>In the opposite direction, many foods are still alive when you harvest
them, for example because they are seeds or fruits.  They have their
own immune systems to fight off disease and spoilage, for a while at
least.  Green beans can survive and remain free of spoilage for weeks
under even fairly unfavorable conditions.  Winter squash and potatoes
can last for months.</p>
<h3>Physical structure</h3>
<p>So suppose you have 250 kilograms of dry food with a density of 1kg/ℓ.
You need to rotate it properly so as to keep it from expiring, and
keep it in hermetically-sealed vermin-proof containers of around a
kilogram each, ideally in the dark, at a consistent, low temperature.
How do you do it?</p>
<p>A big part of the solution is to store most of the food in 1¼-ℓ
soft-drink bottles, making sure it's in pieces small enough to fit
through the necks without jamming.  These bottles are about 32 cm tall
and about 9 cm across.  You need about 200 of them, or to allow for
the fact that some of them will be partly empty at any given time,
300.</p>
<p>These bottles have a few other advantages over other alternative food
storage methods that I haven't mentioned above: they're very difficult
to break (I've watched a bus drive over an empty soft-drink bottle
without breaking it), they're designed to be food-safe, they're very
lightweight, they come in a variety of pleasing shapes and colors,
they can be deflated when empty for compact storage and transport (at
some cost to their sturdiness and pleasing shape), and they're free,
in the sense that they're discarded in huge numbers.</p>
<p>300 of these bottles standing next to each other on the floor would
occupy a rhombus consisting of two equilateral triangles some 162 cm
on a side, which would actually hold 324 such bottles; its total area
is about 2.3 square meters, for a total volume of about 0.73 cubic
meters.  (That means this arrangement is mostly empty space, which is
because the bottles are partly empty and in themselves only occupy
about 61% of the volume of the hexagonal prism enclosing them).</p>
<h4>The coffee-table pantry</h4>
<p>These 2.3 square meters (say, a rectangle of 1.6 meters by 1.4 meters)
could fit inside a coffee table, for example, which could have doors
on the side that open or a top that swings open.  162 cm provides 18
bottles per long row and 17 bottles per short row; 140 cm provides 18
rows, half short and half long.  The total is then 315 bottles.  A
hexagonal or rhomboid coffee table would be both more space-efficient
and more entertaining.  A few centimeters of styrofoam around the
outside and thermal mass such as sand in the bottom would go a long
way to keeping temperatures consistent.  (If you labeled the bottle
bottoms, you could stick them neck-down into the sand, so the sand
wouldn't diminish the bottle storage capacity.  An average depth of
5cm of sand would need 114 liters of sand, which would weigh about 260
kg, doubling the mass of the coffee table, and probably roughly
doubling its thermal mass as well.)</p>
<h4>The curtained-wall pantry</h4>
<p>What if you want to shelve the bottles instead?  If you divided that
area into eight equal-area shelves (spaced 37½ cm apart, floor to
ceiling) each shelf would need to be about 0.28 square meters.  At a
minimal shelf depth of 9 cm --- one bottle --- it would cover a bit
over three meters of three-meter-high wall space.  If you extended the
9-cm shelving to fill the whole four-meter wall of my living room,
you'd have space for 44 bottles per shelf, 352 in all.  You'd probably
want to hang a curtain in front of it to provide insulation, darkness,
and aesthetics.  (Although orderly rows of shapely bottles filled with
dried foodstuffs of varying visual textures has its own aesthetic
appeal.)</p>
<h4>The loft pantry</h4>
<p>While both of these approaches are livable, they still do reduce the
available living space somewhat.  Your 500-kilogram coffee table would
be a hell of a thing to stub your toe on.  An approach that would
enhance rather than compromise the architectural merits of this living
room would be an overhead loft space for the bottles: a single shelf
of the 2.3 square meters, some 40 cm below the ceiling, would be 47
centimeters wide, providing an alcove at one end of the living room.
Rather than ensmallening the living space, this would just transform a
part of it into a cozy nook, enhancing the rest of the room.  The
ceiling in the nook might be 2½ meters high instead of the 3 meters of
the rest of the room.</p>
<h4>The chest pantry</h4>
<p>If you wanted to reduce the physical dimensions of your year's worth
of stored food to a minimum without abandoning the bottle strategy,
for example to make it more portable, you could probably have an upper
layer of bottles neck-down, sticking through round holes in an upper
shelf, with their conical necks nestling into the gaps between the
necks of the bottles in the lower layer.  Arranged this way, I think
the second layer of bottles would add only about 22 cm of height to
the thing, for a total of about 54 cm high in 1.14 square meters of
floor area: 107 cm square, or a hexagon of around 120 cm from corner
to corner.</p>
<p>You'd probably want to build the upper shelf in four to six pieces
that could be lifted separately, since it would contain 125 kg of food
when full, and you'd need to lift it off to access the bottles below.
Each of four pieces would weigh at most 32 kg, which most people can
lift safely.</p>
<p>Adding a third layer of bottles neck up would increase the total
height to some 86 cm and diminish the floor area to about 87 cm by 87
cm.  This is probably close to the minimal-dimension configuration, so
let's work out the details a bit more.</p>
<p>If you have at least 300 bottles, at least 100 in each layer, you
could make the bottom and top layer hexagons of 127 bottles --- 7
bottles on each side of the hexagon, 13 from corner to corner.  Then
the middle layer would be an uneven hexagon of 101 bottles.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This gives you a total of 355 bottles, a distance across the corners
of 117 cm, and a distance across the flats of 101 cm.  Not as small as
you might hope.</p>
<p>But 355 seems a little excessive if we just want to accommodate 200
bottles plus some extra to compensate for some bottles being partly
empty.  Suppose we use smaller hexagons: 6 bottles on each side of the
regular top and bottom hexagons, for a total of 91 each, and 75 in the
irregular middle layer:</p>
<pre><code>     * * * * * *               
    * * * * * * *               * * * * * *

     * * * * * *                 * * * * *
</code></pre>
<p>Then we have 257 bottles, still 86 cm tall, 11 bottles (99 cm) across
the corners, and about 86 cm across the flats.  This is probably the
minimal-dimension configuration.</p>
<p>With the Terma bottles I'm using for my estimates here, you can get a
full 10 cm of interpenetration of layers by putting the second layer
neck down.  But without putting the second layer neck down, just
spreading out the spacing of the bottles by about half a centimeter,
you can still get about 8 cm, and you can get it with both of the
upper layers, instead of just one.  This turns out not to be an
improvement.</p>
<p>If you actually built this chest full of potentially 321 liters of
stored food, you'd probably want to put it on heavy casters so you
could move it around.  Otherwise it still wouldn't be very portable
unless it was mostly empty.  320 kilograms is not a weight you can
reasonably lift.</p>
<h4>The underground pantry</h4>
<p>If you don't live up in the air somewhere (I'm about four meters off
the ground as I write this), you can get extremely consistent
temperatures, constant darkness, and little oxygen just by burying
things less than a meter into the ground.  Many vegetables can keep at
least a year this way, and roots like potatoes, ginger, onions, beets,
manioc, and turnips have the additional advantage that they will do
the work of burying themselves for you, if you just let them grow.
And if vermin attack your root vegetables, well, it's a shame, but at
least they're not inside your house.</p>
<p>Geopolitically, root vegetables are credited as a major force in
peasants' attempts to evade conquest and taxation in, for example,
Zomia (if I recall the name correctly) and Ireland.  You can't burn a
field of potatoes, you can't tell how many potatoes there are in it,
and you can't confiscate them if the farmer won't tell you where they
are.</p>
<p>I suspect that you can get some of these root vegetables to last
longer than a year by burying them deeper so they don't sprout in the
spring.</p>
<h2>Growing food at home</h2>
<p>This brings me to growing food at home, instead of storing it.  Among
my earliest memories, I remember my mother plowing the back yard with
a Roto-Tiller to plant a garden, mostly corn.  All my life she's had
at least tomato plants, and often sunflowers too; and last I saw, my
father (who left her decades ago) had a few rows of corn in his
backyard in Minnesota.</p>
<p>That is not the way to save time and money.  That's gardening as a
hobby, not gardening for frugality and resilience.</p>
<p>To garden for frugality and resilience, you need to focus on the
things that provide the highest return --- the least effort for the
greatest benefit.  As I documented in the other post, you can buy all
the corn you can eat for two years for about US$200, at retail.
Unless you have less than a few hundred dollars a year to spend on
food, or you're preparing for a total collapse of civilization, you
shouldn't spend your scarce gardening time on raising more corn or
potatoes.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on foods that require very little effort and very
little land area, and are difficult to store instead of growing.
Don't grow anything you can easily buy dry in quantities you'd eat in
a week.  For example, here in Buenos Aires's temperate climate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sprouts.  My first attempt at sprouting turned about 100g of dry,
  boring, high-carbohydrate mung beans into about 400g of crunchy,
  fresh, low-carbohydrate, high-protein, juicy stir-fryable
  vegetables, which lasted several days.  It took a few minutes a day
  for three or four days.  My second attempt turned about 100g of dry,
  boring, high-protein soybeans into a moldy mess.  If I figure out
  how to do this right, I'll be eating some bean sprouts every week,
  year round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rosemary.  It's nearly impossible to kill, and although you can dry
  it for storage, dry rosemary is a pale shadow of fresh rosemary.  A
  single plant in a pot can give you enough rosemary to spice every
  meal.  I think I've heard you can use it to keep moths out of
  clothing, too, but I haven't tested that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hot peppers.  Really hot varieties can also provide you more than
  enough spice for every meal from a single plant in a pot.  Some
  varieties are also spectacularly gorgeous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mints.  Similarly, a small pot can provide enough mint to spice
  every meal, and it's hard to kill; the usual problem is that if it's
  not in a pot, you have to police it aggressively to keep it from
  choking out everything else in the area.  There are a lot of
  different mint varieties with widely varying flavors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basil.  Likewise, but you'll need several large pots rather than one
  small one if you like pesto.  Try to keep it from going to seed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squash.  Squash vines are also quite aggressive and hard to kill,
  and when their season comes, they tend to produce volumes of squash
  that go beyond anything reasonable.  You can't really raise them in
  a small pot.  Summer squash, once picked, goes bad quickly enough
  that I fear buying it if I'm not planning to use it immediately, but
  I think it stays good for weeks on the vine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nasturtium.  Better known as a decorative flower, it's also edible
  with a kind of mustard-like spicy flavor.  Both the leaves and the
  flowers are edible, and the flowers are gorgeous.  It requires very
  little care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bay, aka laurel.  It's a hardy evergreen tree, and its leaves can be
  used to keep moths away and to spice food; they're strong enough
  that you usually only need a fraction of a leaf per serving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tomatoes.  If you have a few meters of fence that you can plant
  thickly with tomato vines, when they come into season, you can
  easily have thousands of tomatoes.  This requires more care than the
  other plants mentioned, since the tomatoes are pretty attractive to
  pests, and they don't keep nearly as long on the vine as the other
  plants mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other herbs: oregano, parsley, cilantro, thyme, sage, lavender,
  lemon verbena, and so on.  Many herbs are much better fresh than
  dry, will rot if you cut them and don't dry them, and can't be
  bought in small enough quantities for a single meal.  If you have a
  dozen pots of a dozen different herbs, you can choose among a dozen
  different fresh herbs for every meal.  This can go a long way toward
  making frugal food palatable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've heard that chard also has pretty good frugality performance, is
  dead easy to grow, and grows year round, but I haven't tried growing
  it yet myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Olives, if you inherited an olive tree.  Otherwise, maybe plant one
  and hope your grandkids will benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mushrooms, maybe?  I don't know how to grow mushrooms, but they
  don't need access to sunlight, they can live on garbage (right?) and
  one or two of them really dramatically improve the flavor of a lot
  of foods.  But they don't last long, and you often can't buy just
  one or two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blackberries, if you have a lot of land, or mulberries.
  Blackberries are thorny, but otherwise easy to pick, and they're
  very hard to kill; you don't need to worry about pampering them.
  They make a wonderful jam, which you can eat year-round if you can
  it when they're in season.  I haven't seen them growing in Buenos
  Aires, but they grew wild and abundant in the Presidio in San
  Francisco, whose climate is similar.  Mulberry trees are also quite
  hardy once established --- IIRC they can grow deep taproots to
  survive long droughts --- but they take years to mature, and your
  chances of getting a male tree that produces no fruit is 50-50.
  Mulberries essentially cannot be bought, because they don't last
  long enough once picked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Storing water at home</h2>
<p>Stockpiling food, as explained above, is a potent weapon against
poverty and geopolitical uncertainty.  Stockpiling water will probably
not help you get out of poverty, since you already buy it in bulk, you
don't benefit from variety, and it's never on sale.  And water
supplies typically remain available anywhere inhabited by people,
except for short periods of time, even when your city is being bombed
to smithereens.</p>
<h3>A week's worth of water in the bathtub</h3>
<p>Sometimes, however, a "short period of time" might be three or four
days, or a week, due to nothing more serious than a power outage.  A
sufficient stockpile of water can improve your resilience against
power outages.  It's really hard to cook dried food without water.</p>
<p>At Burning Man, we had to bring our own water.  The recommendation was
8 ℓ/day, for cooking, drinking, and showering in an extremely hot, dry
climate.  A week's worth would then be 56 ℓ.  That's about half a
bathtub full, and if you have a bathtub and forewarning of a possible
interruption, filling up the bathtub is a reasonable response.</p>
<p>If you want to be prepared for a week-long water interruption without
forewarning, it's not reasonable to keep your bathtub full of clean
water all the time.  The water will go stagnant and breed algae, mold,
and mosquitoes.  You'll stink from not bathing.  Instead, you need
containers, you need to be able to seal them, and you need to remember
to rotate them.</p>
<h3>Water bottles</h3>
<p>For Burning Man, we actually used 56-liter military-surplus
bacteriostatic plastic water bottles.  Rotating 56 liters of water
every few months is going to be a huge pain in the ass if you're
trying to use containers much smaller than this.  20-liter bottles
might be reasonable, and they're a lot easier to move around than the
56-liter ones are.  3-liter bottles are not reasonable.</p>
<h3>Barrels</h3>
<p>A 200-liter barrel is probably a thoroughly reasonable and widely
available solution.  Food-safe, sturdy 200-liter plastic barrels with
sealing screw tops are a standard item all over the world, as are
devices for moving them around when they're full.  They go for about
US$10 to US$20 used in the US.</p>
<p>For your house, though, you'll probably want to fill and empty the
barrel with a hose.</p>
<h3>Soy-sauce bottles</h3>
<p>A more ghetto, but also quite effective, container is the 20-liter
soy-sauce bottle, which is small enough that you can carry it around
when full, rectangular, and unlike the mil-surplus bottles we took to
Burning Man, stackable.  I wash my laundry in a bucket cut from the
bottom of one of these that I found near a dumpster outside a Chinese
restaurant last month, labeled "DO NOT REUSE".  They're made of
thoroughly unbreakable polyethylene, they have handles to lug them
around with, they're food-safe, and originally they ship with a
hermetically-sealed screw top.  They're not bacteriostatic, though,
and the one I fished out of the trash stream had been long separated
from its screw top.</p>
<p>Three 20-liter soy-sauce bottles, a week's supply of water, would
occupy a little less space than the year's supply of food considered
earlier.</p>
<h3>Chlorination</h3>
<p>It's recommended to chlorinate your stored drinking water with bleach
to a level where it's not really safe to drink, I think 100ppm or
200ppm.  Water thus chlorinated should last for months or years.  (I
forget what the official recommendation on rotation for water thus
chlorinated is, but I think it's six months or a year.) Before you
drink it, you dechlorinate it by letting it sit in an open jar
overnight.  (I think you can boil it, too, if you're in a hurry.)</p>
<p>There are other poisons you could put in the water to keep it sterile,
but they're harder to remove.</p>
<h3>Storing a year's worth of water</h3>
<p>If you wanted to store enough drinking water for a year, perhaps
because you were insane, the 8 liters a day multiplies out to 2920
liters for the year: fifteen 200-liter barrels whose contents you'll
have to rotate once or twice a year.  This is three tonnes of water,
occupying three cubic meters.  This would occupy less than 6.25% of my
living room, so it might be a reasonable thing to have in your house
--- or, better, outside your house where it won't wreck everything if
it springs a leak --- if you had some other use for it, other than
preparing for a disaster that is unlikely ever to happen.</p>
<p>For example, three tonnes of water is a fairly large thermal mass, and
eminently capable of internal convection.  Raising or lowering its
temperature by a degree requires 13 megajoules, which is 3.5 kilowatt
hours.  Freezing or thawing it requires almost a gigajoule, 260
kilowatt hours.  This could allow you to time-shift the use of energy
to warm or cool something to a time of day when energy is easily
available, or to harvest ambient temperature at a reasonable time of
day.</p>
<p>Or you could put it in a swimming pool and filter it if you wanted to
drink it.  Swimming pools are still a pain to maintain, but at least
they're fun, in a way that a psycho apocalypse water barrel complex
isn't.</p>
<p>Speaking of the same thing more prosaically, if you have a tank of
hundreds of liters of water, it's not going to change temperature much
between day and night unless it's really, really shallow, so you can
take a cold bath any time, day or night.  In a heat wave, this can
save your life.</p>
<h2>Storing fuel at home</h2>
<p>A lot of the food I've described here isn't edible without cooking.
Some commonly-eaten legumes are actually dangerous to eat raw,
especially kidney beans.  But if you can't pay the bill one month and
they turn off your gas or electricity, or if there's an earthquake, or
if somebody's air force bombs your city's power plants or transmission
lines, or there's a heat wave and consequent power outages, you could
be out of luck forever if you don't have fuel stored up.</p>
<p>And energy is important for other things as well as cooking.</p>
<h3>Wood and charcoal</h3>
<p>The most common response to this situation is to cook with wood, dried
poop, or charcoal, which isn't very convenient and is dangerous --- it
produces carbon monoxide and, except for charcoal, carcinogenic and
irritating smoke.  (This is the biggest cause of childhood death
today, now that we've dramatically ameliorated the diarrhea
situation.)  The fuel is also kind of a pain to keep stored, and it
can harbor wildlife, including termites, deadly spiders, mice, rats,
and cockroaches.</p>
<h3>Compressed gas</h3>
<p>The next-most-common response is to store LP gas or CNG in a tank,
either inside or outside your house.  This works fine, is reasonably
safe, and is extremely convenient because you can adjust the flame
instantly.  It does involve a certain amount of up-front investment if
you're not renting the tank, and it's not completely safe; people have
produced spectacular explosions by accidentally driving cars into LP
gas tanks.</p>
<h3>Alcohol</h3>
<p>A less-common approch is to cook with alcohol.  The Penny Stove is a
stove burner which can cook a meal with tens of milliliters of
alcohol, weighs a few grams, and can be made from two discarded
aluminum cans and a worthless coin.  Ethanol is a particularly safe
fuel: it won't explode if its container is breached, doesn't usually
burn the surface it's burning on top of (so it probably won't burn
your skin if you get splashed with it), can be extinguished with
water, produces very little carbon monoxide when burning, and is much
less toxic than alternatives like gasoline or methanol.  It's also
usable for disinfecting water or wounds and as a solvent for some
things, and because it doesn't require high-pressure containment, it's
more portable than LP gas or CNG.  It's much more expensive than those
fuels, though.  Ethanol here currently costs about AR$20 per liter,
and that liter might cook 50 meals --- AR$0.40 per meal.  In the Penny
Stove, it's also less controllable than gas fuels, but I think there
are camping stoves that provide similar levels of control to a regular
gas stove.</p>
<p>If you're poor enough to worry about US$1 per day of food costs,
cooking on alcohol may be a low-upfront-investment alternative to
buying a gas cylinder or hookup and gas stove.  It's a lot more
convenient and safer than wood or charcoal.  It might even be cheaper
than those fuels if you have to buy them, but most people scavenge
them instead.</p>
<p>I've previously written on kragen-tol about inherently-safe ethanol
storage XXX by floating your ethanol bottles in your water stockpile,
so that almost any conceivable storage accident will result in the
ethanol mixing with the water and becoming nonflammable.</p>
<h3>Solar cooking</h3>
<p>Solar cooking is a zero-fuel-consumption alternative, but it's less
convenient than cooking with fire unless you have a bunch of
heat-storage bits that are not very frugal yet.  Still, I think you
can make reasonable solar cookers entirely out of garbage, assuming
you have sunlight access.</p>
<p>Specifically, if you have a thermal storage tank for molten salt, you
can use that to cook with solar heat whenever you want; the eutectic
mixture of nitrates of potassium and sodium melts at 221°, hot enough
to bake with, and has a heat of fusion near that of water, so you can
store a huge amount of heat in a tiny space.  But this is very far
from being a practical option to save money.</p>
<h3>Refrigeration</h3>
<p>Refrigeration also suffers when energy supplies are interrupted.  If
you have a superinsulated icebox as I suggested earlier, or even if
you keep your refrigerator and freezer full of bottles of water when
they have available space, you may be able to weather some days
without refrigeration power.</p>
<p>In our Vanagon, we had a dual-fuel refrigerator, which could run off
the 12-volt van electricity (for hours) or the 12-liter LP gas tank
(for days or weeks).  It was of the ammonia-absorption type, which is
somewhat more hazardous than the usual HCFC-compression type to have
inside your house, but has no moving parts other than the gas valve.
Gas-fueled refrigerators are common in houses in rural parts of the
US.</p>
<p>With a somewhat more elaborate system, I think you could run an
ammonia-absorption chiller from a solar concentrator to freeze ice
(maybe salted) during the day, and use the ice with a secondary heat
transfer circuit to keep your food cold.  This is not very practical
for individual frugality unless somebody commercializes it.</p>
<h3>Space heating</h3>
<p>Jesus, you think it's cold in your house without the heat on?  Do you
have a medical problem with body-temperature regulation?  Otherwise,
you know, in igloos, people get naked, even though the igloos aren't
melting.  You can adjust.  Insulate your house, chink the cracks, put
on a sweater, put a mylar blanket over your regular blanket, snuggle
up to somebody, and quitcher complaining.</p>
<p>(Some solar thermal mass might help too.)</p>
<h3>Air conditioning</h3>
<p>This is a bigger problem; many more people die in heat waves than in
cold waves.  Their houses get too hot, because they don't have air
conditioning or because the power went out, and they die.  As the
climate changes, we'll see more and more heat waves, and more and more
mass deaths as a result.  Air conditioners require a lot of energy;
you need a hefty generator to run one, and it will gobble up lots of
generator fuel.  In theory you could run one off solar heat (see
earlier comment under Refrigeration) but it's simpler to just have
lots of thermal mass around you, thick enough that it'll stay cool
past the end of the heat wave.  Traditional adobe construction was
about a meter thick, and solved that problem.</p>
<p>In theory, you could build a Thermal Mass Stockpile in your house just
like an emergency food or water stockpile.  In practice, it's
considerably more difficult and not really practical.  It would be a
little alcove of adobe (or brick, or stone, or concrete), just big
enough for you to be comfortable inside, with meter-thick walls,
ceiling, and floor, and a closeable door.  If you made it horizontal
--- a thermal-refuge version of a Kapuseru Hoteru bunk --- you could
probably get by with a one-meter by one-meter by two-and-a-half-meter
inside volume, enough of a sturdy metal frame to keep it safe from
collapse, a mattress, and a light.  The outside dimensions would be 3
m × 3 m × 3½ m, for a total volume of 31½ cubic meters, of which 29
cubic meters would be adobe.  About 64 tonnes of adobe.  This is going
to be more than 6.25% of your living space, and your downstairs
neighbors are going to raise hell about the cracks in their ceiling.</p>
<p>(You could actually keep your food and water stockpiles inside of it,
keeping them at a consistent temperature and slightly cutting down on
the adobe requirements all at once.)</p>
<p>Failing that, if you have, or recently had, a working refrigerator,
soft-drink bottles filled with frozen water can make a huge
difference.  Sleep with one, wrapped in a towel, at night; snuggle up
to one during the day.  If the air temperature gets above about 35°,
snuggle up to an ice bottle or two under blankets; instead of keeping
your body heat from escaping into the air, the blankets keep the air's
heat from escaping into your body and the ice bottles.  In a sense,
your ice bottles are your "stockpile of air conditioning".</p>
<p>Or you could take a cool bath, if you have or can get cool water.</p>
<p>If you live on the ground instead of up in the air like me, you can
just dig a meter-deep trench in the ground, shore it up to keep it
from collapsing, put a cover over the top, and lie down in it.  This
has its potential problems (radon, groundwater, propane or freon) but
digging out five or six tons of dirt beats the hell out of molding 64
tons of it into bricks or heaping 64 tons of it on top of your box.</p>
<p>All of these thermal-mass stockpile approaches become slightly more
practical when they're for more than one person.  If you have four
people, you can build a 4×2½×1 meter capsule with a meter of adobe
around it, and instead of 64 tons of adobe for one person, you have
5×3½×3 - 4×2½×1 = 42½ cubic meters of adobe, or 93½ tonnes for four
--- less than 25 tons each!</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/pricing.html">Pricing</a> (89 notes)
