<p>(Warning, this note is kind of rambling with no real point.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Mirrored/AdvProgLangDesign/">Finkel</a>
says, describing Modula-3's subtyping rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If every value of one type is a value of the second, then the first
type is a called a 'subtype' of the second. For example, a record
type TypeA is a subtype of another record type TypeB only if their
fields have the same names and the same order, and all of the types
of the fields of TypeA are subtypes of their counterparts in TypeB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Initially, this struck me as violating ML's "value restriction" and
therefore being unsafe, but I was wrong.  Suppose we say</p>
<pre><code>type Ushort = 0..65535;
     Long = -2147483648..2147483647;
     TypeB = record
       Data: Long;
     end;
     TypeA = record
       Data: Ushort;
     end;
</code></pre>
<p>Now it seems that <code>Ushort</code> is a subtype of <code>Long</code>, because every value
of type <code>Ushort</code> is a value of type <code>Long</code>.  So it is safe to assign a
value of type <code>Ushort</code> to a variable of type <code>Long</code>.  <code>TypeA</code> and
<code>TypeB</code> have fields of the same names in the same order, and the
single field in <code>TypeA</code> has a type that is a subtype of the single
field in <code>TypeB</code>.</p>
<p>However, I guess if you're passing by value, you can safely copy a
record of type <code>TypeA</code> into a variable declared as a record of type
<code>TypeB</code>, and you're still safe with no run-time type checks.  </p>
<h2>Mutable Aliases Introduce Problems</h2>
<p>It's only once you get into aliasing that you start running into
problems; if you have a record that is mutably accessible through both
<code>TypeA</code> and <code>TypeB</code> pointers, you can set its <code>Data</code> to <code>-1</code> through
the <code>TypeB</code> pointer and then access it through the <code>TypeA</code> pointer.</p>
<p>It seems that if you could ensure that the <code>TypeB</code> pointer were
<code>const</code> --- that is, didn't allow modification of the pointed-to value
--- you could avoid this.  That would allow the following subtyping
rule:</p>
<pre><code>if                    TypeA is a subtype of TypeB
        -------------------------------------------------------
then    pointer to TypeA is a subtype of pointer to const TypeB
</code></pre>
<p>That allows you to copy a pointer to <code>TypeA</code> into a variable declared as
pointer to const <code>TypeB</code>.  Which is pretty much equivalent to copying a
<code>TypeA</code> into a variable declared as <code>TypeB</code>, but more efficient.</p>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>When it comes to arrays of the same element type but varying sizes,
the definition of "A is a subtype of B" that works in the above
subtyping rule is "A's indices are a superset of B's indices".  That
is, if you have an <code>int[100]</code> array, it's perfectly OK to copy a
pointer to it someplace that is expecting a pointer to a <code>const
int[10]</code> array; no run-time type checks will be needed.  Actually,
though, that's true even if that pointer isn't <code>const</code> --- which I
guess is Finkel's point when he distinguishes "extensions" from
"subtypes".</p>
<h2>Lack of Conclusions</h2>
<p>Anyway, just some interesting things I hadn't realized before about
safe static typing.  There's a subtyping relation that still applies
after you take mutable references, and another one that doesn't, and
the one that doesn't can be pretty broad.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
