(2 minutes)</div><p>Suppose you design a REST system in which every GET or PUT includes a
transaction ID, which is a URL, assigned by some kind of transaction
serialization service.  Any piece of code that wants to make changes
to resources must allocate a transaction ID from the transaction
serialization service.</p>
<p>Some resources are merely files, while others are synthetic, with
their representations produced on demand from other resources.  When
you GET the URL of a file, the file notes your transaction ID, and if
it changes in the future while your transaction is still active, it
will post a change notification to your transaction ID.  When you PUT
a file, the new state is at first only visible to GETs with your
transaction ID.</p>
<p>When a transaction is completed, you tell the transaction service to
commit your transaction.  It first verifies that none of the files you
GETted have had changes committed to them by a previously committed
transaction; if this is true, it tells all the files you PUTted to
commit your change.</p>
<p>(It’s unclear to me whether the transaction service has to do all of
this dependency tracking or whether the file servers can do some of
it.)</p>
<p>If, instead, one or more of the files have changed, then the
transaction service refuses to commit your transaction, instead
rolling it back.  Then you can retry the whole transaction from the
beginning, or give up and report failure.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
