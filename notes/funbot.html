<p>(Previously published <a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2008-February/000881.html">on
krageon-tol</a>.)</p>
<p>Thinking about my “<a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2007-March/000855.html">object-oriented equational rewrite rules</a>” and IRC
bots.</p>
<p>Suppose we think of definitions like</p>
<pre><code>    c = (f - 32) * 5 / 9
</code></pre>
<p>as defining properties that exist on every object that meets their
qualifications (and isn’t shadowed by some previously-existing c).
Then we could think of something like this:</p>
<pre><code>    todayweather = { f: 95, windspeed: 37 }
</code></pre>
<p>as defining a property ‘todayweather’ that exists on every object.
And then you could plausibly ask, on an object that has only the
properties that all objects have (the Ur-Object), what are the
properties that have a c property?</p>
<pre><code>    c?
            { todayweather: 36.1, normalweather: 25 }
</code></pre>
<h2>Namespaces</h2>
<p>If you’re doing this on an IRC bot on a casual channel, you could have
a namespace per nick, and only enumerate properties in your own
namespace.  So there might be [kragen]c and [Isomer]c; but I could
refer to properties from other namespaces explicitly if I wanted to;
simply importing:</p>
<pre><code>    f = [isomer]f
</code></pre>
<p>or using without importing:</p>
<pre><code>    c = ([isomer]f - 32) * 5 / 9
</code></pre>
<h2>Actual Programs</h2>
<p>Let’s hold off for now on any way to make these properties (as
opposed to their value on a particular object) first-class in the
language.  But let’s have self-quoting keywords, like in Prolog or
Erlang (lower-case), or Common Lisp or Ruby (with colons).  I’m pretty
sure that if I use lower-case for auto-quoting, I’ll end up with Very
Important-Looking Programs, so I’m thinking I’ll use backquote (`)
instead.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a little syntactic sugar for lists.  Let’s say that
if we have some semicolon-terminated expressions inside parentheses,
with the last semicolon optional, it is syntactic sugar for a list
made of conses:</p>
<pre><code>    ( a; ) =&gt; { x: a, y: `nil }
    ( a; b; c ) =&gt; { x: a, y: { x: b, y: {x: c, y: `nil } } }
    () =&gt; `nil
</code></pre>
<p>Even without first-class properties, we can still write:</p>
<pre><code>    (`nplusone; n).apply = n + 1
</code></pre>
<p>such that we can write</p>
<pre><code>    (`nplusone; 3).apply
</code></pre>
<p>and get 4.</p>
<p>Given that, we can write map:</p>
<pre><code>    (fn; ()).map = ()
    (fn; {x, y}).map = {x: (fn; x).apply, y: (fn; y).map}
</code></pre>
<p>And filter:</p>
<pre><code>    (fn; ()).filter = ()
    (fn; {x, y}).filter = (fn; x; (fn; x).apply; y).filter2
    (fn; x; `t; y).filter2 = { x: x, y: (fn; y).filter }
    (fn; x; `f; y).filter2 = (fn; y).filter
</code></pre>
<p>It’s pretty brutally obvious that we need some special syntax for cons
here.  Let’s try infix @.</p>
<pre><code>    (fn; ()).map = ()
    (fn; x @ y).map = (fn; x).apply @ (fn; y).map
    (fn; ()).filter = ()
    (fn; x @ y).filter = (fn; x; (fn; x).apply; (fn; y).filter).filter2
    (fn; x; `t; y).filter2 = x @ y
    (fn; x; `f; y).filter2 = y
    ().length = 0
    length = 1 + y.length
    x.reverse = ((); x).reverse2
    (a; ()).reverse2 = a
    (a; x @ y).reverse2 = (x @ a; y).reverse2
</code></pre>
<p>That works OK, and I could imagine people typing it in IRC.  It would
probably be good to eliminate the argument-order dependencies as much
as possible, and reduce the number of properties defined on all lists
of length two or three.  In the below, {foo, bar} is short for {foo:
foo, bar: bar}, and any free variables are required properties of the
object the property is defined on.</p>
<pre><code>    {list: ()}.map = ()
    map = (fn; list.x).apply @ {fn, list: list.y}.map
    {list: ()}.filter = ()
    {list: x @ y}.filter = {fn, x, include: (fn; x).apply, 
                            y: {fn, list: y}.filter}.filter2
    {include: `t}.filter2 = x @ y
    {include: `f}.filter2 = y
    ().length = 0
    length = 1 + y.length
    x.reverse = { reversed: (), left: x }.reverse2
    {left: ()}.reverse2 = reversed
    {left: x @ y}.reverse2 = { reversed: x @ reversed, left: y }.reverse2
</code></pre>
<p>Those aren’t quite so brief, but they’re still within the length where
people could plausibly type them in a conversation.</p>
<p>So how about strings?  Let’s suppose that strings support the
interface of lists of one-character strings, work properly in
pattern-matching, and that one-character strings additionally have a
.ord property that tells you their ASCII code.  Can we split words on
spaces?</p>
<pre><code>    " ".space? = `t
    {ord}.space? = `f
    ({space?: `t} @ y).words = y.words
    ({space?: `f, x} @ y).words = {wletters: (x;), left: y}.word
    {left: {space?: `t} @ rest}.word = wletters.reverse @ rest.words
    {left: x @ rest}.word = {wletters: x @ wletters, left: rest}.word
    {left: ()}.word = (wletters.reverse;)
</code></pre>
<p>That’s not too bad.  It compares favorably to Scheme in total code
volume:</p>
<pre><code>    (define (words string) (words-of-list (string-&gt;list string)))
    (define (words-of-list clst) (map list-&gt;string (words-list clst)))
    (define (words-list clst)
      (let ((x (car clst)) (y (cdr clst)))
        (if (char-whitespace? x) (words-list y) (word (list x) y))))
    (define (word wletters left)
      (cond ((null? left) (list (reverse wletters)))
            ((char-whitespace? (car left))
             (cons (reverse wletters) (words-list (cdr left))))
            (else (word (cons (car left) wletters) (cdr left)))))
</code></pre>
<p>The Scheme is 10 lines, 59 words, 498 characters, in place of 7 lines,
47 words, 299 characters.</p>
<p>So from there I think you could quite reasonably, e.g. implement
ternary trees and compute a time-efficient inverted index of a big bag
of strings.  Say, old chat lines, or a small number of HTML documents.</p>
<h2>Precedence</h2>
<p>When you have more than one rule that’s applicable to finding a
property value, you have to decide what to do.  Should you use the
first rule, use the second rule, or combine them somehow?</p>
<p>Aardappel used specificity ordering.  I think you should do the same
here, given that the “source code” is a bunch of people chatting.  But
it would probably be helpful if the specificity ordering were partial,
so that the users would have to resolve potential conflicts manually.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The question of syntax is a little ugly but probably soluble.  The
normal namespace syntaxes are as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    Syntax          Precedents              Why Not
    isomer/f        Unix                    used for division
    isomer\f        MS-DOS                  painful memories
    isomer.f        C++, Java, Python       used for property access
    isomer:f        MacOS, XML              used for property definition
    isomer::f       C++, Perl               too verbose
    isomer f        Smalltalk               not verbose enough
    [ISOMER]F       VMS                     forgotten
    isomer'f        Ada, Perl4              painful memories, unbalanced '
    isomer$f        R, DCL                  painful memories, ugly
</code></pre>
<p>There are some other alternatives, especially if we involve Latin-1:</p>
<pre><code>    isomer|f isomer»f isomer«f isomer§f isomerºf isomer-&gt;f
    isomer&gt;f isomer¦f isomer×f isomer÷f isomer¬f isomer®f isomer©f
    isomer±f isomer£f isomer·f isomer=&gt;f isomer=-f isomer:-f
    isomer--f isomer-)f isomer-»f isomer°f isomer*f isomer~f
    isomer!f isomer[]f isomer()f &lt;isomer f&gt; &lt;isomer&gt;f isomer&lt;f&gt;
    isomer_f @isomer.f
