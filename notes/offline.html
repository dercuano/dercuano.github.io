capacity of a modern laptop disk, if it was going to be disconnected

<p>8.4 GiB: Project Gutenberg 2010 DVD, 29,500 ebooks, most pre-1921 English lit<br />
12.5 GiB: Debian 7.0.0 amd64 DVD images, all free software in Debian, compiled<br />
34.1 GiB: Debian 7.0.0 source DVD images, the source for the same software<br />
 9.7 GiB: the articles in the English Wikipedia, an overview of all knowledge<br />
13.2 GiB: StackExchange dumps, all common technical questions with answers<br />
19.9 GiB: Planet.osm, a map of most of the streets and rail lines in the world<br />
 6.8 GiB: Open Library latest dump, bibliographic data on all published books<br />
15.0?GiB: Freebase in Turtle RDF, a unified database about everything known<br />
20.0 GiB: wikileaks-files-20100612.tar, Wikileaks Full Archive, including cables  </p>

<p>139.6GiB: total</p>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/datasets">http://aws.amazon.com/datasets</a> lists a number of freely-available
datasets on Amazon S3; not only can you download them directly from
there, but you can also fire up an EC2 machine with gratis network
access to them in order to analyze them, extract relevant parts, and
summarize and compress.  For example, the 2.2 terabyte Google N-Grams
corpus is available, and you could quite reasonably fire up a machine
to fetch all the 3-grams that occurred more than 5 times and return
them in a compressed format.  (A particularly interesting free dataset
is the 81-terabyte Common Crawl Corpus, containing 5 billion crawled
web pages.)</p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/help/oa/index">http://arxiv.org/help/oa/index</a> describes the arXiv Open Archives
Initiative interface, which is suitable for bulk-downloading of all
abstracts of the 850 000 papers in the arXiv (essentially all
significant current math and physics papers, and a smaller but still
significant fraction of other academic papers.)  In 2010, <a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/ListArchives/1010/msg00073.html">the papers
totaled 200GiB</a>, but there was no bulk download interface publicly
available.  Later, <a href="http://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data_s3">http://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data_s3</a> explains that
they are now available in S3, including both the source LaTeX and the
rendered PDF versions.</p>
<p>Citeseer has a bibliographic record for the majority of scientific
publications in any field, including pointers to online versions of
the articles where available.  They, like the arXiv, support the OAI
for bulk downloading of this data.  There seems to be a dump from 2010
in <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/commugrate/data/citeseer/">http://www.cs.purdue.edu/commugrate/data/citeseer/</a>, which looks
like it might be around a hundred megs compressed.
<a href="http://www.hrstc.org/node/33">http://www.hrstc.org/node/33</a> explains how to do an OAI bulk download
and reports that, as of 2009, it ended up as about 500MB of
uncompressed XML.</p>
<p>IMDB has bulk downloads available, and I guess movies are pretty
popular: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces">http://www.imdb.com/interfaces</a>.  The data isn't free, but
it's available for some uses.  It looks like it's a gigabyte or two.</p>
<p>Project Gutenberg has gone from 30 000 titles to 43 000 since 2010,
and many of the new titles and versions include illustrations, but I
don't know where to do a bulk download of all of this data.  It has a
substantial number of non-English books these days, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://datahub.io/">http://datahub.io/</a>, organized by the Open Knowledge Foundation, has
a collection of already-structured datasets, but most of them are
small and they are somewhat spammy.
<a href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets">http://www.infochimps.com/datasets</a> is another similar, but
apparently somewhat better, collection.</p>
<p><a href="http://dbpedia.org/About">http://dbpedia.org/About</a> is an effort to extract structured data
from Wikipedia, which has substantial overlap with Freebase.  Shallow
discussion of the relationships between the two projects can be found
at <a href="http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/DBPedia">http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/DBPedia</a> and
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=dbpedia%20freebase&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CD0QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.dbpedia.org%2Fcategory%2Finter-linkage%2F&amp;ei=mU_aUZqYF6iXiQKJwoCoDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcf8Bti6uQcqv-aDUjwG4lg_YY7A&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.cGE&amp;cad=rja">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=dbpedia%20freebase&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CD0QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.dbpedia.org%2Fcategory%2Finter-linkage%2F&amp;ei=mU_aUZqYF6iXiQKJwoCoDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcf8Bti6uQcqv-aDUjwG4lg_YY7A&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.cGE&amp;cad=rja</a>.
Among the interesting sub-datasets in DBpedia are "bijective
inter-language links", "short abstracts", and "geographic
coordinates".  I can't tell how big the whole DBpedia dataset is, but
it looks like it should be a few gigabytes.  It also sort of looks
like the project is faltering, since the latest DBpedia release is at
<a href="http://downloads.dbpedia.org/3.8/en/?C=S;O=A">http://downloads.dbpedia.org/3.8/en/?C=S;O=A</a>, and it's a year old,
despite their quarterly release schedule.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/680-california-learning-resource-network-textbooks">http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/680-california-learning-resource-network-textbooks</a>
is among the interesting things on ClearBits other than StackExchange;
it's 0.8 gigabytes of supposedly high-quality secondary-school
textbooks in English, called the California Learning Resource Network
Textbooks, from the California Free Digital Textbook Initiative.
Another 0.3 gigabytes at
<a href="http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/158-physics-textbooks">http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/158-physics-textbooks</a> covers
secondary-school physics.</p>
<p>There's a couple of attempts to put the Khan Academy in an
offline-accessible form.  One is <a href="http://khan.mujica.org/">Khan Academy on a Stick</a>, which
is just a 16GiB selection of 2000 English video lectures, and a
similar set of 800 in Spanish.  A much more ambitious project is
<a href="http://kalite.learningequality.org/">KA-Lite</a>, which includes exercises, progress tracking,
multilingual subtitles, and the ability to make your own selection of
videos; I don't have a clue how much space this stuff takes up, aside
from the videos, but I imagine not much on the scale we're talking
about here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/571-fsi-mandarin-chinese---complete-course">http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/571-fsi-mandarin-chinese---complete-course</a>
is a public-domain Mandarin Chinese course in 1.6 GiB.</p>
<p>GenBank is the NIH's annotated collection of all publicly available
DNA sequences.  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/2261">A 200GiB 2009 snapshot of GenBank</a> is on S3.</p>
<p><a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/">http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/</a> has a
500-meter-resolution true-color map of the earth made from MODIS
satellite data, with month-by-month composites.  This could be a nice
supplement to OpenStreetMap data, but I'm having a bit of a hard time
downloading it.  Calculations suggest that in JPEG form it should be
about 9 gibibytes, since each world coverage should be about 0.7
gibibytes.  Now that Landsat data is open-access, and even available
in pre-downsampled form, it should be straightforward to produce a
higher-resolution version; if we budget 20 GiB, to be comparable in
weight to the OpenStreetMap planet.osm data, we could manage about
100-meter resolution.  If you were more judicious, you could skip the
100-meter resolution on open water and use data down to Landsat's
15-meter resolution limit in areas the OSM data shows to be dense.</p>
<p><a href="http://geonames.org/">http://geonames.org/</a> is a CC-BY collection of eight million place
names, with coordinates, which is a lot more than you can get from
Wikipedia.  I think it's about a gigabyte.</p>
<p>Not all the software in Debian is adequately documented within Debian
itself.  In particular, Debian includes no tutorial for C, as far as I
know, although I am pleasantly surprised to find that the
<code>c++-annotations</code> package contains a tutorial for C++ for people who
already know C; and the RFCs that document much of what you need to
know about networking are relegated to the "non-free" Debian
repository, which is not included on the DVD images.  I have no idea
how big non-free is.</p>
<p>I think the WikiLeaks snapshot (from 2010, when they were having a
hard time keeping the site up in the face of censorship attempts from
the USG) includes the full Cablegate file only in encrypted form.
After David Leigh negligently published the encryption key in a book,
WikiLeaks re-released the full, but censored, Cablegate archive (only
0.6 GiB) at <magnet:?xt=urn:btih:AUHKVFRXREM7DCVK54MBDBGHQNPHLG5J>.
These leaked US diplomatidc cables have been a major primary source
for journalists writing new articles over the last few years, as well
as a major source of civil unrest in US "allies".</p>
<p>A similarly important set of primary sources may be WikiSource.  The
English Wikisource dump is currently 1.3GiB
<a href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwikisource/20130629/">http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwikisource/20130629/</a> but doesn't
include images, because Wikimedia dumps never include images.  But
that's probably okay in this case, because most of Wikisource seems to
be transcriptions rather than scans.</p>
<p>What about music?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Archive Team archive of all the MIDI files they found on
  GeoCities, which probably covers most 20th-century US popular music
  and a fair bit of other music (albeit in low quality), is fairly
  tiny and contains some fifty thousand songs.  It's very likely
  illegal, though.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.infochimps.com/tags/music?page=4">http://www.infochimps.com/tags/music?page=4</a> has some other related
  datasets.</li>
<li><a href="http://cantorion.org/">http://cantorion.org/</a> has a large collection of scanned
  public-domain sheet music, mostly classical, and collections of it
  have been uploaded to the Internet Archive.</li>
<li><a href="http://discogs.com/">http://discogs.com/</a> has a public-domain database of metadata on 35
  million recorded tracks, with dumps at
  <a href="http://www.discogs.com/data/">http://www.discogs.com/data/</a>, which are some 0.2GiB.</li>
<li><a href="http://freesound.org/">http://freesound.org/</a> has a mixed CC-sampling-plus and CC0
  database of samples for making music with, which may or may not be
  bulk-downloadable.</li>
<li>However, there's an 8.5GB chunk of sound samples released under
  CC-BY for OLPC at <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sound_samples">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sound_samples</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://imslp.org/">http://imslp.org/</a> has 220 000 musical scores, mostly of
  public-domain music, which may or may not be bulk-downloadable;
  there's a very old torrent backup from 2008.</li>
<li>Musicbrainz I think is already incorporated in Freebase, but it has
  rich metadata on some 12 million recorded tracks.</li>
<li>The MOD Archive had some 120 000 songs in MOD and related formats as
  of 2007, totaling 31.2 GiB; these are somewhere in between MP3 and
  MIDI in their level, since they include the samples.  But the MOD
  Archive is also probably almost entirely illegal, because the
  samples come from all over the place and were frequently copied from
  one MOD musician to another without consent.</li>
<li>Mutopia has some 1600 public-domain musical scores which can be
  played with MIDI or typeset with LilyPond.  I assume these can be
  bulk-downloaded, but they're tiny.</li>
<li>Musopen has a collection of public-domain music recordings, but no
  bulk download as far as I can tell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some very valuable kinds of information that may not be present in any
of the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport schedules, e.g. bus and train schedules, not to mention
  route information (OSM has some route information);</li>
<li>Contact information for people and businesses (i.e. phone books;
  available from, say, Yelp or Foursquare).</li>
<li>Reputation information for people and businesses (i.e. Yelp), or
  even for pages (e.g. the freely-available page hits data for
  Wikipedia articles, for use in ranking search results.)</li>
<li>In-depth engineering data, e.g. Machinery's Handbook, the CRC
  Handbook, Organic Syntheses, electronics datasheets, and so on.  US
  military MILSPECs may provide some useful data here.</li>
<li>Pricing information about pretty much anything: minerals, chemicals,
  electronic parts, commodities, stocks, forex, household appliances,
  foods.</li>
<li>Social graph information.  Presumably any number of spy agencies
  have a full crawl of the social graph from Facebook, including
  everybody's profile photos, but Facebook's terms of service forbid
  doing this, so nobody admits to it.  But this is in the terabytes,
  anyway, since you have at least thousands of bytes for the profile
  picture times about a billion accounts.  If you just wanted
  uncompressed names and graph links, without geographic or photo
  info, it's probably on the order of 64 links (of 4 bytes each) per
  person, total 256 bytes, plus their name, so about 200 to 300 GB.</li>
<li>Travel information, like WikiTravel: what to see when you get to
  Córdoba, how to get there, what neighborhoods to avoid, how the
  local taxi system works, where to stay.  WikiTravel is licensed
  under a CC-BY-SA license that would permit this in theory, but I'm
  not sure how to download a snapshot dump of it in practice; they
  seem to be trying to make it difficult.  Hitchwiki might be an
  alternative, but it seems nascent — its dump is only 15MB.</li>
<li>Cooking recipes, other than the very old ones from Project
  Gutenberg.</li>
<li>Guides to identifying natural things, such as plants, animals,
  rocks, and diseases.</li>
<li>Much in the way of modern how-tos.  en.wikibooks has almost 2700
  books at the moment, and might help some; but if you want to know
  how to fix your 1997 Ford Taurus, how to incorporate a company in
  Argentina, how to upgrade the hard disk in your Dell Mini 9, etc.,
  you're out of luck.  A fair bit of this kind of information may be
  available in the public domain from the US Military, but finding and
  organizing it will be difficult.</li>
<li>Nutritional information.</li>
<li>Public records information, such as land titles, lawsuit records,
  invention patents, EDGAR filings, trademark filings, marriage
  records, statute law, caselaw, or international treaties.</li>

<p>A much smaller-scale version of this problem is: what should I put in
my next paper notebook?  I'd like to print some things out: obviously
my friends' phone numbers and other contact information, a map of the
city and surrounding areas, and so on.  I can print them in reduced
size, as long as I can still read them; I think I can distinguish 600
pixels per inch with a magnifying glass, and ordinary laser printers
can print that.  My current notebook is 288 pages, which is to say 144
leaves, or 72 sheets of paper, which are roughly A5-size, one
thirty-second of a square meter, so 2¼ square meters of paper in
total, or 4½ square meters of paper surface.  The smallest reasonable
ASCII font is about 6×4 pixels, which works out to 23.25 million
characters per square meter, or about 105 megabytes of text.  If we
use the traditional 80×66 unit for a "page", that's 19 815 pages.</p>
<p>Now, I only want to fill a fraction of the notebook with text.  So
what are the most useful, say, ten to thirty megabytes I could print
out and bind into my new notebook?  The Wikipedia Vital 100 articles
at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_100">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_100</a> might be a
reasonable thing to include, for example.  Ten articles chosen from
there by random clicking are Fire (12 pages), Crime (16 pages),
Biology (18 pages), Human sexuality (38 pages), Earth (32 pages),
History of the World (27 pages), History of art (16 pages), Philosophy
(33 pages), Mathematics (12 pages), and Energy (19 pages).  These sum
up to 223 pages, suggesting that the Vital 100 in total will be about
2230 pages.  This would be a fairly straightforward thing to include
in the notebook in its reduced form; if we figure 56 reduced pages per
notebook page, it would occupy about 40 pages.</p>
