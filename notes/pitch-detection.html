<p>These are my notes on pitch detection algorithms for three DSP
projects I want to do: the Magic Kazoo, the R2D2 Light Switch, and
Ultranarrowband Speech.</p>
<h2>The projects</h2>
<p>The Magic Kazoo is a synthesizer the size of a regular kazoo that you
play mostly by holding it in your mouth and humming into it.  It does
live looping, sampling, synthesis of a variety of instruments, rhythm
accompaniment, harmony, and autotune.</p>
<p>The R2D2 Light Switch is a light switch that you control by whistling
at it to turn lights in your house on or off, or possibly dim them,
change their color, or activate disco dancing strobe mode.  Instead of
running regular speech recognition algorithms which require a lot of
processing power and are easily confused by background noise, I’d like
to use a small number of chirp-based whistle signals, maybe with
analog components to control brightness.</p>
<p>For the Magic Kazoo, I want to be able to do pitch detection on a
distorted human voice, vastly outweighing any noise, with very low
latency, like, under 10 ms, with relatively low computational cost,
like under 50MIPS. For an R2D2 Light Switch, I want to be able to
detect whistled pitch patterns even in the presence of substantial
background noise, but I can tolerate latency up to maybe 200 ms, and
it would be reasonable to use gigaflops if necessary.  For
Ultranarrowband Speech, pitch estimation is a necessary element, and
it operates under fairly strict latency constraints (traditionally up
to some 40 ms).</p>
<p>Why does the Kazoo need so little latency?  <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/papers/latency98/latency98.htm">Brandt and Dannenberg
around 1997</a> say: “There do not seem to be published studies of
tolerable delay, but our personal experience and actual measurements
of commercial synthesizer delays indicate that 5 or maybe 10 ms is
acceptable. This is comparable to common acoustic-transmission delays;
sound travels at about 1 foot/ms.”</p>
<p>Such low latency is particularly challenging because human voice
pitches are often as low as 100Hz or even lower, which means 10 ms is
a single period.  Worse, the precision needs to be pretty high; if we
autotune, we can afford up to a quarter-step of pitch error, which is
about 2.9%.  At 44.1ksps, 100Hz is a period of 441 samples, so the
period estimation can be off by only up to about 13 samples.  This is
definitely doable with either zero-crossing detection (with a
sufficiently amplified waveform) or various kinds of
autocorrelation-based measures (with low distortion).</p>
<p>Ultranarrowband Speech is an effort to develop a comprehensible speech
codec below one kilobit per second.  However, I have recently learned
that such algorithms already exist, like David Rowe’s Codec 2, which
manages comprehensible speech at 700 bits per second.</p>
<h2>The algorithms</h2>
<h3>Zero-crossing counting</h3>
<p>Simple counting of zero-crossings, on the raw waveform or on variously
filtered versions, is the simplest thing to try.  But to achieve the
kinds of latency we’re talking about here, we need to use the lapse
between the zero-crossings, not the number of zero-crossings during
some predefined interval.  Perhaps the median lapse during the last
10–20 ms or so would be the best measure to use for this.</p>
<p>The downside of counting zero crossings is that you discard almost the
entire wave, and that wave has a lot of information about the current
phase which it would be better not to discard.</p>
<h3>Quadrature encoding with the derivative</h3>
<p>Another approach that has occurred to me is to use the instantaneous
amplitude and derivative to estimate a phase quadrant, which you can
use like a quadrature encoder to count revolutions.  It also gives you
phase information twice as often as simple zero-crossing counting.</p>
<h3>Phase-angle tracking with the derivative</h3>
<p>Going further in that direction, you could imagine estimating a phase
angle, and timing the first time the phasor reaches a given phase
angle during each cycle.  At each new angle, you can measure the time
lapse since it reached that angle during the previous cycle.</p>
<p>Measuring the derivative can be done in a variety of ways, but it’s
important to keep in mind that the derivative is proportional to the
frequency, among other things.  So you have to multiply the derivative
by something to get the phasor to follow a roughly circular pattern
near your desired frequency (say, within an octave or two of it).  As
long as you’re privileging a certain octave, you might as well run
some degree of low-pass filtering over it as well — for example,
differencing the latest sample from a simple moving average over the
last N samples, or differencing a shorter moving average from a longer
one.  The width of these moving averages provides a crude low-pass
filter, and the lag between their centers provides a high-pass filter.</p>
<h3>Particle filters</h3>
<p>Another approach is to maintain a variety of hypotheses in memory
about what the waveform is doing, updating the probability of each one
in a Bayesian fashion after each sample, then resampling the
population of hypotheses according to the implicit distribution.</p>
<p>The hypotheses can be things like “repeating the wave N samples back
with M amount of Gaussian noise” or "silence" or “a new wave with a
period around P Hz”.</p>
<h3>Autocorrelation</h3>
<p>This is sort of the gold standard.  If you’re working on a 10-ms
window at 44.1ksps, you need 441*440/2 = 97'020 multiply operations,
most of which are multiply-adds.  You could maybe do this every
millisecond, which ends up as 2200 multiply-adds per sample, 2.2
million per second.  Then you need a bit more work to look at the
autocorrelation spectrum and pick out the peaks.  This is probably too
slow to do in real-time on many processors, but it’s an easy first
thing to try, and provides a basis for comparison for other
algorithms.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/hci.html">Human–computer interaction</a> (76 notes)
