The simplest way to do this, given a somewhat unpredictable AC voltage
source, is with a diode or bridge rectifier.  This has a couple of big
problems, though: the diodes dissipate more than half of the energy
you’re trying to harvest, and without any significant linear
resistance, the capacitor gets fully charged during the first
quarter-cycle, so if the capacitor is large, they’re dissipating it
very rapidly and will explode.</p>
<p>(A reason you might not see this happen in practice is that your
energy source isn't actually a voltage source, i.e. negligible
impedance; more on that later.)</p>
<p>If you have a diode or resistor or some other passive element in
series with the capacitor, it’s going to take up whatever the voltage
difference is between the capacitor’s current state of charge and the
voltage source.  Ideally you would like that to be just enough to push
the right amount of current through the passives to charge the
capacitor, so that almost all the energy gets harvested instead of
dissipated.</p>
<p>You could maybe do it literally like that using a buck regulator:
instead of regulating the duty cycle of the PWM signal in the buck
regulator to seek a fixed goal voltage, regulate it to seek a fixed
goal current.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
