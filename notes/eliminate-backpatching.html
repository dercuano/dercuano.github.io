(8 minutes)</div><p>Conventional compilers, assemblers, and linkers require some
non-sequential access to their output stream in order to insert
forward references: places where a piece of code must contain the
address of some later piece of code or data.  Normally this is done by
maintaining the output program in RAM along with a database of
unresolved references and "backpatching" it when one of those
references is resolved.</p>
<p>But can we avoid this, so that all code can be output as soon as it is
generated, and still have a practical programming system?  I mentioned
this in a conversation with Jeremiah Orians, and I think I see a
couple of ways.</p>
<h2>How assemblers backpatch</h2>
<p>In assemblers this is conventionally fairly unrestricted: you can
mention an undeclared label <code>foobar</code> wherever, and this generates an
undefined relocation for that label.  If you define <code>foobar</code> later on,
either as a label or with EQU, the assembler may go back and backpatch
all the previous <code>foobar</code> references, but if you don't (and maybe even
if you do), it leaves the job to the linker.</p>
<p>In conventional assemblers, this single mechanism provides for
procedure call, looping, conditionals, exception handling, other local
control flow, function pointer generation, and references to
statically-allocated variables, and in some cases even to things like
thread-local variables.</p>
<h2>How Forth backpatches</h2>
<p>Forth systems normally don't do a lot of this.  Forth words are
defined purely in terms of words (subroutines and variables) defined
previously, textually prior to them, so they don't need to do any
forward referencing for procedure calls, access to
statically-allocated variables, or function pointer generation, and so
no backpatching is needed in these cases.  Mutual recursion can be
arranged by defining a "DEFERred" word which is later updated to
invoke a word defined textually later in the source; in a sense this
is backpatching, but DEFER permits this definition to be changed
multiple times, including at runtime --- it's a statically-allocated
function pointer variable.</p>
<p>For control flow within a subroutine, though, Forth systems
conventionally do backpatch in three cases: loops that may run zero
times (such as ?DO loops), loops that may exit in the middle (such as
BEGIN WHILE REPEAT loops), and conditionals (IF ELSE THEN).  For these
purposes, they maintain a compile-time stack both to compile backward
jumps (which require no backpatching) and to backpatch forward jumps.</p>
<p>Is there no way to avoid this?</p>
<h2>A sorting linker</h2>
<p>As I said before, if your compiler or assembler relies on the linker
to put in the forward references, it doesn't need to backpatch them
itself, so it can emit code immediately, at least if it doesn't care
too much about optimizing it.  But that just palms the distasteful
random access off on the linker; it doesn't eliminate it.  Can you do
a linker without random access?</p>
<p>Well, sure, if you accept a lot of sequential access instead.  You can
shred the code into snippets that start at each symbol reference, each
tagged with its start address (which may mean that you have some
zero-length snippets), and mergesort them by the symbol name, while
you mergesort the symbol definitions in a separate file.  Then you can
do a sort-merge join between the two files, formatting each symbol in
the appropriate way for each relocation, to produce a file of properly
linked snippets, still in symbol-name order.  Then you can sort this
file by start addresses and merge the overlaps where there were
multiple symbol references at the same address, probably of different
relocation types.  Easy.  Lots of "compilers" in the 1950s worked this
way, I imagine.</p>
<p>But it's not highly efficient, if your objective really is to compile
programs substantially larger than your RAM; you may need quite a few
passes over your sequential files to finish the link.</p>
<h2>Conditional returns</h2>
<p>Suppose instead we structure all of our conditionals as conditional
returns.  Consider abs(x) = x if x &gt; 0 else -x.  You can compute this
with the following sequence of operations:</p>
<pre><code>result = x
x &gt; 0?
if so, return
negate result
return
</code></pre>
<p>The "if so, return" conditional requires no backpatching to implement,
perhaps a forward jump over a return instruction, and indeed
instruction sets like ARM (see <a href="../notes/arm-assembly.html">My very first toddling steps in ARM assembly language</a>) implement it
directly.</p>
<p>However, this comes at a heavy cost.  The more general case f(x) =
g(x) if h(x) else j(x) can be implemented straightforwardly like this:</p>
<pre><code>result = g(x)
h(x)?
if so, return
result = j(x)
return
</code></pre>
<p>But this involves computing g(x) in cases where we don't want it; this
is at least computationally wasteful, and if g(x) has some observable
effect, actually incorrect.  You can do it correctly at moderate cost
with an auxiliary function:</p>
<pre><code>f'(x, c) =
    c?
    if not, return
    result = g(x)
    return

f(x) =
    c = h(x)
    result = f'(x, c)
    c?
    if so, return
    result = j(x)
    return
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this can be compiled purely in sequence from the definition
"f(x) = g(x) if h(x) else j(x)", as long as we allow ourselves to
revise our notion of f's entry point once we get to the "if"; and this
is true for arbitrarily long inline computations in place of g, h, and
j, <em>as long as j contains no conditionals</em>.  That is, it doesn't
generalize to the usual conditional cascade form "g(x) if h(x) else
(j(x) if k(x) else m(x))", since the test for h(x) would need to come
after the test for k(x) in the object code to prevent forward
references.  Although this is much less useful, it does generalize to
the form "(g(x) if h(x) else j(x)) if k(x) else m(x)", which arises
from PHP's incorrect associativity of <code>?:</code>:</p>
<pre><code>f''(x, c') =
    return unless c'
    result = g(x)
    return

f'(x, c) =
    c' = h(x)
    result = f''(x, c)
    return if c'
    result = j(x)
    return

f(x) =
    c = k(x)
    result = f'(x, c)
    return if c
    result = m(x)
    return
</code></pre>
<p>All of these pieces can contain arbitrary exit-at-the-bottom loops and
other computations, though.</p>
<p>If we replace the <code>return</code> at the end with a jump back to the top of
the function, what we have is a normal exit-at-the-top while loop
where the code before the conditional can do arbitrary computation,
like Forth BEGIN WHILE REPEAT.</p>
<p>So this approach requires you to write your code in a pretty strange
style with, usually, at most one conditional per function, and the
conditional written <em>after</em> the consequent but before the alternate,
as in Python conditional expressions.  But it does seem feasible.</p>
<h2>Conditional call and return</h2>
<p>If we suppose that we have a conditional call instruction (or
instruction sequence), we can do this a little more reasonably:</p>
<pre><code>f'(x) =
    result = g(x)
    return

f(x) =
    c = h(x)
    result = f'(x) if c
    return if c
    result = j(x)
    return
</code></pre>
<p>If we have conditional call, we don't really need conditional return:</p>
<pre><code>f'(x) =
    result = g(x)
    return

f(x) =
    c = h(x)
    result = f'(x) if c
    result = j(x) unless c
    return
</code></pre>
<p>However, this restricts the form of the j(x) expression; it needs to
be nothing more than a function call.  No such restriction applies to
g or h, and if you have both conditional call and conditional return,
it doesn't apply to j either.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
