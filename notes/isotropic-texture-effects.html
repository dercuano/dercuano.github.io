<p>I was walking by some of those goofy hipster chalkboard signs in my
<em>cheto</em> neighborhood today and noticed that a lot of them are produced
from a bunch of relatively simple transformations of letterforms:
outlining, drop-shadowing, color gradients, and so on.  It occurred to
me that it’s probably feasible to mechanically explore restricted but
visually interesting sets of such transformations in the form of DAGs
of a simple algebra.</p>
<p>In many cases, it would be ideal for the transformation to be
shift-invariant (s-i), rotation-invariant (i), resolution-invariant
(r-i), and bounded-amplitude (b) — that is, transforming a shifted,
rotated, or resampled image should produce the shifted, rotated, or
resampled transformation of the original image, and that it should be
possible to compute bounds on the brightness of the pixels in the
transformed image, at least given bounds on the brightness of the
images in the original image.  Moreover, if you want to do image
approximation for style transfer (see <a href="../notes/image-approximation.html">Image approximation</a>) it
might be helpful for the transformation to be differentiable with
respect to some set of parameters.  These restrictions reduce the
space of possible transformations in a way that should dramatically
accelerate stochastic exploration and mathematical optimization.</p>
<p>Note that it is quite explicitly <em>not</em> a goal to restrict ourselves to
<em>linear</em> transformations.</p>
<p>This is quite similar to, and inspired by, the abundance of excellent
work in recent years on computer vision using artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>(See also <a href="../notes/texture-algebra.html">An algebra of textures for interactive composition</a> and <a href="../notes/cheap-textures.html">Cheap textures</a>.)</p>
<h2>Colors</h2>
<p>In the below, I generally speak of “images” as two-dimensional
regularly sampled grids of scalar numbers.  This is most apt to
grayscale images; the simplest way to incorporate color images is to
treat them as three separate images, one each for red, green, and
blue.</p>
<h2>The basics: isotropic scale-space representation</h2>
<p>Given a sampled image, you can convolve it with some linear filter to
get a transformed image; this transformation is shift-invariant (s-i)
from the definition of convolution.  If the filter’s impulse response
is isotropic, which is to say rotation-invariant (i), this
transformation will be isotropic.  If the linear filter <em>fₛ</em> has a
scale parameter <em>s</em> such that <em>fₖₛ</em> gives the same linear filter
resampled to a new sampling grid <em>k</em> times larger, then you can
satisfy the resolution-invariance criterion.  You can derive
reasonable amplitude bounds on the resulting image from amplitude
bounds on the original image and on the filter’s impulse response.</p>
<p>A particularly appealing filter is the Gaussian, the scaled function
<em>e</em><sup>-<em>r</em>²</sup>, both because it’s the only isotropic separable filter and
because it can be very inexpensively approximated using CIC or
Hogenauer filters, called repeated box blurs in image
processing — independent of the radius, a quadratic approximation to
the Gaussian (up to a constant scale factor) takes only six
subtractions per pixel, given a dimension-indepenent third-order
two-dimensional prefix sum (aka summed-area table) of the image, which
requires six additions per pixel to compute, and in general about four
times as much space as the original image.</p>
<p>(An additional desirable property is that Gaussian convolution is
closed under composition: the composition of two Gaussian convolutions
is a third Gaussian convolution whose scale parameter is simply the
sum of the scale parameters of the two.)</p>
<p>This is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_space">scale-space representation</a> used in machine
vision since the 1960s, the two-dimensional analogue of the
one-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_transform">Weierstrass transform</a> used in analysis (and in
particular function approximation) since the 1800s.</p>
<p>So you can use Gaussian convolutions with arbitrary constant radii as
elementary operations in your algebra of transformations without risk
of producing an inefficient, anisotropic (¬i), shift-variant (¬s-i),
resolution-dependent (¬r-i), or unbounded (¬b) transformation.
Moreover the transformation is differentiable with respect to both the
input image and the scale parameter.</p>
<p>Another class of scalable isotropic filters that admit especially
efficient implementations of convolution are flat† circles — circular
boxcar filters.  These are less efficient than Gaussian convolution,
especially as kernel sizes grow, but, as discussed in <a href="../notes/convolution-bokeh.html">Real-time bokeh algorithms, and other convolution tricks</a>, they still admit much more efficient
implementations than are generally known in the literature, on the
order of 1–3 additions and subtractions per scan line in the kernel,
or less if polygonal approximations are used.</p>
<p>Flat circle convolution is i and r-i except for aliasing artifacts, b,
and s-i.  It’s differentiable with respect to the input image, but
it’s imperfectly differentiable with respect to the scale parameter;
the flatness constraint requires the circle to expand by discrete
pixels, which create discontinuities in its derivative.  I feel like
you should be able to make a differentiable version by lerping between
circles of adjacent radii; using the above-linked algorithms, such a
filter can be implemented at much less than twice the cost of a single
flat circle convolution, since the two circles will be equal on most
scan lines.</p>
<p>† “Flat” in the sense that all points within the support of the filter
have the same “height”.</p>
<h2>Nonlinear morphological operators</h2>
<p>Another class of shift-invariant, resolution-invariant, and
bounded-amplitude transformations on images with efficient
interpretations are the nonlinear morphological operations of erosion
⊖ and dilation ⊕; if used with an isotropic “structuring element” or
kernel, such as a flat circle, these operations are isotropic.  These,
too, have been used in machine vision since the 1970s.  As described
in <a href="../notes/bresenham-erosion.html">Some notes on morphology, including improvements on Urbach and Wilkinson’s erosion/dilation algorithm</a>, Urbach and Wilkinson published an
algorithm that can evaluate these operators with flat kernels at only
slightly higher computational cost than the linear convolution with
flat circular kernels described in the previous section, and it’s
straightforward to shave off another factor of 2 or 3 from Urbach and
Wilkinson’s algorithm in most cases.</p>
<p>So you can use erosion and dilation with flat circles with arbitrary
constant radii as additional elementary operations; as with the
isotropic convolution cases, this poses no risk of producing an
inefficient, anisotropic, shift-variant, scale-variant, or unbounded
transformation.</p>
<h2>Combining operators</h2>
<h3>Arithmetic pixelwise combination</h3>
<p>Given constant images and the above elementary unary operations on
images, we can combine them pixelwise using most of the standard
mathematical operators: +, -, ×, ∧ (minimum), ∨ (maximum), and in some
cases ÷, if appropriate bounds can be shown to hold for the input
images.  (But not %.)  In particular, note that
pixelwise-nonlinear ×, ∧, and ∨ permit the
realization of nonlinear image filtering operations even without the
use of any nonlinear neighborhood operations such as the
morphological operations.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can apply a number of unary operations pixelwise, such
as exp, sin, cos, atan, and in some cases ln.</p>
<h3>Bounds-preserving operators</h3>
<p>However, I think the above set of combining operators is somewhat
suboptimal with respect to its boundedness and efficiency.  It’s true
that you can compute bounds on <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> or <em>a</em> × <em>b</em> given bounds on
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, but if you’re randomly assembling DAGs in this algebra, a
lot of them will randomly have very large or very small bounds.  It
would be desirable to have a similarly expressive set of operations in
which, if both inputs are bounded to some range, the output is too.</p>
<p>In particular, consider the case of <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> ∈ [0, 1].  Then
these continuous, pixelwise combining operations preserve that bound:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 - <em>a</em></li>
<li>½<em>a</em> + ½<em>b</em></li>
<li>½<em>a</em> - ½<em>b</em> + ½</li>
<li><em>a</em> × <em>b</em></li>
<li><em>a</em> ∨ <em>b</em></li>
<li><em>a</em> ∧ <em>b</em></li>
<li><em>a</em> + <em>b</em> × (<em>c</em> - <em>a</em>) (lerp)</li>
<li>lg (1 + <em>a</em>)</li>
<li>2<sup><em>a</em></sup> - 1</li>
<li>½sin(<em>ωa</em> + <em>φ</em>) + ½</li>
<li>0 if <em>a</em> = 0 else <em>a</em>/(<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>)</li>
<li>0 if <em>a</em> = 0 ∨ <em>b</em> = 0 else 2/(1/<em>a</em> + 1/<em>b</em>) (scaled resistors in
  parallel; soft minimum; harmonic mean)</li>
<li>√(<em>a</em>)</li>
<li><em>a<sup>k</sup></em>, more generally</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, all but ∧ and ∨ are everywhere differentiable; those may
happen to be differentiable in a particular case.  It might be
possible to use the harmonic mean above or √(<em>ab</em>), the <em>geometric</em>
mean, in place of <em>a</em> ∧ <em>b</em>, but it’s not a very good substitute.</p>
<h2>Anisotropy</h2>
<p>The algebra of image filtering above can express a wide range of
effects, but since all of its operators are isotropic, it can’t
express anisotropic effects, which for better or worse include
calligraphic stroke emphasis (including goofy hipster ironic Victorian
puffery effects) and drop shadows. By adding just a simple shift
operator to the algebra, <em>s<sub>m,n</sub></em>(<em>p</em>) = (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) =&gt;
<em>p</em>(<em>x</em> - <em>m</em>, <em>y</em> - <em>n</em>), we can gain a wide variety of such
anisotropic transformations, while still guaranteeing b, s-i, and
r-i—except for aliasing artifacts. Differentiability suffers from the
same kind of aliasing artifact as the flat circle convolution, and
similarly bilinear interpolation is sufficient to mostly restore
differentiability. However, bilinear interpolation suffers from its
own artifacts, having to do with the lousy approximation the triangle
kernel is to a sinc.</p>
<p>To fully restore differentiability, we need a differentiable
interpolation operator, such as quadratic spline interpolation, which
additionally is a much better approximation of sinc. It requires nine
multiply-accumulates per pixel, though perhaps I can strength-reduce
that to three, or one if it is separable or close enough.</p>
<p>To account for both the computational cost and the anisotropy we would
like to minimize, it may be a good idea to include a special penalty
term for the use of the shift operator in cost functions used for
mathematical optimization.</p>
<h2>Dynamical systems</h2>
<h3>Discrete time</h3>
<p>In addition to static graphs of image transformations, we can think
about evolving an image over time. One simple way to do this is to
iterate a transformation some number of times — that is, run it with
its previous output as its new input.  This can give rise to
interesting behavior even with very simple transformations.  (This is
also one of the motivations for seeking combining operations with
output bounds the same as input bounds.)</p>
<h3>Continuous time</h3>
<p>However, the number of times the transformation runs in that
state-machine scheme is necessarily discrete — and such discretized
time means that the result cannot be differentiable with respect to
time.  As a possible alternative, we can use a transformation to
define an <em>ordinary</em> differential equation that specifies the temporal
evolution of the image: the pixelwise difference between the original
image and the transformed image gives the pixelwise time derivative of
the evolution.  (It can be seen that, except for numerical
approximation errors, this will never lead the pixel outside the
smallest interval containing both its own range and the range of the
transformed pixel; so if both are [0, 1], it will remain within [0,
1].)  Then we can use garden-variety Runge–Kutta numerical integration
of ordinary differential equations to compute the image’s evolution,
time step by time step, with high precision.</p>
<p>This makes the resulting image differentiable with respect to the time
parameter — somewhat by fiat, as it were — and allows us to vary that
parameter continuously.</p>
<h2>Differentiable crossbars</h2>
<p>In the above I’ve mostly talked about the DAG of image-processing
operators as if it descended from heaven.  But there occur to me three
major ways to handle this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Expose image-processing operators directly to a user, whether
   through an API, a GUI, or some hybrid, and let them play around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate DAGs randomly, possibly using genetic-programming
   techniques, or exhaustively, possibly using some kind of heuristic
   breadth-first search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a fixed topology that is nevertheless flexible enough to
   generate a wide variety of effects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The third approach is the one taken by most current
artificial-neural-network research, usually through “fully connected
layers” (complete bipartite graphs) and “max-pooling”.  Fully
connected layers of <em>n</em> neurons from <em>m</em> inputs involve multiplying a
vector of length <em>m</em> through an <em>n</em> × <em>m</em> matrix — for every pixel in
your image, if you’re doing something convolutional.</p>
<p>Telephone networks originally worked using fully connected
switchboards: any jack could be patched to any other jack by the
operator by inserting a wire into both jacks.  But this scaled poorly
with the size of the network, so they changed to crossbar switching.</p>
<p>A crossbar switch is a small permutation matrix; it might have four
inputs and four outputs, although in the Telephone network all these
connections were initially bidirectional.  Each of the 16 crossing
points could be closed (1) or open (0).  In this way, any input can be
connected to any output, and indeed every input can be connected to
some output at once when the matrix is 75% sparse.</p>
<p>The trick is that multiple layers of many of these crossbar switches
can produce any permutation of the inputs on the outputs.  (A sorting
exchange network is the special case of this where the crossbars are
2-input 2-output switches.)  Consider a layer of four input 4×4
crossbars, each with one output connected to each of four output 4×4
crossbars.  This is sufficient to connect any of the 16 inputs to any
of the 16 outputs, but it cannot produce all possible
permutations — you cannot have two inputs on the same input switch
connected to two outputs on the same output switch.  All circuits are
busy.</p>
<p>Introducing an intermediate “hidden” layer of four more 4×4 crossbars,
with a similar fully-connected arrangement, does, I think, give you
all possible permutations.  (A simple counting argument shows that it
<em>could</em>, while no arrangement of eight 4×4 crossbars can — 4! = 24,
and 24<sup>8</sup> = 110,075,314,176, while 16! = 20,922,789,888,000,
but 24<sup>12</sup> = 36,520,347,436,056,576; but clearly there are
many ways to get the same output permutation by routing circuits
through different hidden-layer crossbars.)  There is some savings
here: a single-stage 16×16 crossbar would contain 256 contact points,
while this three-stage network contains only 12×16 = 192 contact
points.  Adding further crossbar-switch stages to the network
increases the economy.</p>
<p>What I have in mind here is using 4×4 matrices as differentiable
crossbar switches.  Applied pixelwise to four input images, such a
crossbar produces four output images as linear pixelwise functions of
the inputs, and so a few layers of such stages can substitute more
economically for the fully-connected layers in traditional artificial
neural networks.</p>
<p>The output of these stages is then fed to some set of fixed-function
units attached in a fixed topology to the crossbar outputs: lerp,
multiply, average, max, min, Gaussian blur, shift, and so on.  In this
way, the continuously-differentiable “crossbars” substitute for the
discrete connection topologies we might otherwise have to search
through.</p>
<p>We can apply an optimization penalty for weights that are far from 0
or 1, perhaps later on in the training, as is conventionally done in
topological optimization.  In this way we can give the crossbars an
incentive to sparsify, and thus we can stop computing functions that
aren’t contributing to the results.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
