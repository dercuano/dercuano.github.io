<p>Consider queries of the following forms:</p>
<pre><code>select * from foo where bar between 80 and 101;
select * from foo order by bar limit 10;
select * from foo order by abs(bar - 13) desc limit 10;
select * from foo where bar between 80 and 101 and baz between 2 and 3;
select * from foo order by (bar-10)*(bar-10) + (baz-2)*(baz-2) desc limit 6;
</code></pre>
<p>Conventional SQL indices permit answering the first three of these
with good efficiency, but not the others; conventional SQL query
optimizers do not produce a reasonable query plan for the third given
an index on foo.bar, although it is in theory feasible.  Usually
queries like these are answered with K-d trees or, in the last case in
case of high dimensionality, ball trees, but these structures occupy
significant space, and constructing and updating them is
time-consuming.</p>
<p>Such queries are unfortunately common in applications like
geographical maps, as described for example in <a href="../notes/fast-geo-maps-on-android.html">Fast geographical maps on Android</a>.</p>
<p>An alternative that is somewhat more flexible is to construct a tree
of substrings over an existing file of records, annotated with
intervals describing the data in each substring.</p>
<h2>The interval-annotated-tree data structure</h2>
<p>(There is a standard data structure called an “interval tree” which is
not the same thing, thus the awkward name.)</p>
<p>The underlying data to be queried
is a sequence or “file” of records, which have
some attributes.  The tree is a sort of index for some of these
attributes; each node of the tree pertains to some contiguous
substring of the overall record sequence, and is annotated with the
minimum and maximum value for each indexed attribute that occurs
within the subsequence.  The substrings all begin and end on record
boundaries.
Leaf nodes contain pointers into the sequence
of records, indicating the start and end of the substring to which
they pertain; internal nodes, instead, pertain to the union of their
child nodes, which are disjoint and consecutive.  The root node of the
tree pertains to the entire sequence.</p>
<p>Different branching factors may be appropriate in different
situations; if memory is random access, the structure is in theory
fastest with a branching factor of 2, but with a memory hierarchy, a
larger branching factor is probably better.</p>
<p>If there is some kind of reasonable locality within the existing
sequence, this structure can perform as well as a K-d tree, at a much
lower space cost (since its leaves contain merely pointers into the
sequence of records).  If there is not, it should perform about as
well as brute force.</p>
<h2>Interval query</h2>
<p>To find all the records within a given multidimensional interval — a
criterion of the form attr0 between min0 and max0 and attr1 between
min1 and max1 and attr2 between min2 and max2... — we do a tree
search from the root, pruning a node from the search when the interval
annotation on that node can show that none of the records in its
substring of the sequence can match the query.  In the case where the
query is on a single attribute and the records are sorted by that
attribute, this will take O(lg N) time.  So, too, if the records are
sorted in the order of a traversal of a K-d tree, and the query is on
a subset of the attributes indexed by that K-d tree, even if the
branching factor is not the same.</p>
<p>In some cases it may make sense to also halt the traversal when it can
be determined that <em>all</em> the records within a substring match the
query interval, for example if only a count of the matching records is
required.</p>
<p>Altering a record in the sequence requires updating as many as all of
its ancestor nodes.  Appending a record to the end requires creating
or updating as many as all of its ancestor nodes, and, as with a
B-tree, potentially deepening the tree and adding a new ancestor node
when the root node overflows.</p>
<p>This generalizes, of course, to the case where leaf nodes contain
intervals rather than point-values of attributes, but I think a
standard interval tree (with its sorted lists of intervals crossing
each node’s partition) will perform better in that case, perhaps much
better.</p>
<h2>A simple example</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a branching factor of 8, a leaf size of 32 records, a
total of 16,777,216 records of 64 bytes each, two
perfectly-uniformly-distributed 32-bit attributes indexed, and the
data arranged according to the traversal of a 2-D K-d tree on those
two attributes.  The data amounts to one gibibyte.  There are 524,288
leaf nodes and 599,187 tree nodes in total distributed across 8 tree
levels, including a root node with only two children.  The pointers in
the tree nodes can be all entirely implicit as long as we don’t have
to insert and delete in the middle of the sequence, even if we mutate
or append records to the end of the sequence, so each tree node can be
stored in 16 bytes (4 bytes for the minimum X, 4 bytes for the minimum
Y, etc.)</p>
<p>So the tree occupies only 9,586,992 bytes, under 0.9% of the data
size.  It can be built in time linear in the data size — in a single
sequential input pass outputting tree nodes to 8 sequential buffers,
or in 8 sequential passes reading from a single sequential input
stream and writing to a single sequential output stream.</p>
<p>A tree traversal for a two-dimensional interval that includes only a
single record will prune all nodes but one at each recursion level, so
it will visit the root node, its two children, and 8 nodes at each of
the other six levels, for a total of 51 tree nodes, then the 32
records belonging to the leaf.  If we consider 4096-byte memory pages,
the top four levels can be in a single memory page, and then each of
the other four tree levels will require reading a single page; the 32
records of the leaf node will also be in a single page.  This puts the
total read cost of the query at six pages.</p>
<p>Suppose the query is instead for an interval similarly tightly bounded
in one attribute but open in the other.  This interval will only prune
6 of the 8 children of any given internal node, so it will visit, say,
the root node, its two children, and then at the other six levels, 4,
8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 nodes, respectively, and then 256 leafnodes,
which will be in 256 separate pages.  The top four levels are again in
a single page, while we can suppose that all the other nodes are in
different pages, so we have 1 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 pages: 497 in
total, a total of just over 2 megabytes out of the 1.075 gigabytes of
data.  Still, to answer this query from 8-ms spinning rust, you would
need almost four seconds.</p>
<p>Actually, though, that’s overly pessimistic: the groups of 8 nodes we
are examining at each level are siblings, and so they are presumably
contiguous.  So in fact it’s 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 256 pages.  Adding
another level that includes the actual values of the attributes for
the records would cut that final 256, and thus the query time by a
factor of 8, but bloat the index from 0.9% to 25% of the size of the
original data.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, suppose we do the traversal with an interval
that includes all the nodes.  This is simply a tree traversal that
never prunes, so it just has to traverse an extra 0.9% amount of index
data as it sequentially examines the gigabyte of records.</p>
<p>As explained above, updating or appending a record just involves
updating or creating up to its 8 ancestor nodes; however, if the
update results in the record being out of order, it may degrade the
index’s query performance thereafter.  8 levels of tree is sufficient
up to four gigabytes, at which point the tree deepens and it becomes
9.</p>
<h2>A tiny sketch of building such an index with numpy</h2>
<p>I hacked this out quickly just in order to get some kind of
performance measurement; it could obviously be cleaned up.  I kept the
data size super small because I was plotting things and, although
numpy can deal with tens of millions of items with no problem,
matplotlib falls over.  Obviously in real life you would need some
provision for non-power-of-two sizes, and probably appending records
as well, and you wouldn't want a special-case array for the leafnode
annotations.</p>
<pre><code>x = rand(2**17)
x.sort()

leafnodes = x.reshape((len(x)//32, 32))
lmin = leafnodes.min(axis=1)                       # leafnode min/max
lmax = leafnodes.max(axis=1)

imin, imax = zeros(lmin.shape), zeros(lmax.shape)
size = len(lmin) // 2

imin[:size] = lmin.reshape((size, 2)).min(axis=1)
imax[:size] = lmax.reshape((size, 2)).max(axis=1)

pos = size

while size &gt; 1:
    size //= 2
    imin[pos:pos+size] = imin[pos-2*size:pos].reshape(size, 2).min(axis=1)
    imax[pos:pos+size] = imax[pos-2*size:pos].reshape(size, 2).max(axis=1)
    pos += size
</code></pre>
<p>Building the index this way on my laptop takes about 3–5 milliseconds.
Taking precautions to limit the load on matplotlib, increasing <code>x</code> to
2²⁴ items (128 mebibytes) slows it to 227 ms one time, 194 ms another
time, 182 ms a third time.  Increasing it to 2²⁶ items, I accidentally
crashed my laptop trying to re-evaluate the IPython cell (thus
resulting in two half-gibibyte arrays in memory at once); sorting it
took 10.8 seconds; but building the index tree only took 892 ms.</p>
<h2>Ordering and reindexing flexibility</h2>
<p>The interesting thing here is how the indexing data structure is valid
entirely independent of the record ordering.  For some record
orderings, it reduces to brute force, but it doesn’t give incorrect
results, and the extra cost is mild.</p>
<p>The above case is precisely equivalent to the K-d tree whose traversal
order we suppose the records are encountered in, with some of its
internal nodes purely implicit.  But with some mild degradation,
amounting I think to a small constant factor, the same index data
structure would accelerate such queries on data that is ordered
according to a K-d tree whose node boundaries were not perfectly
aligned with the node boundaries of the index tree.</p>
<p>If the tree traversal is done in a Hilbert-curve order, so that
adjacent nodes in the serialization are also adjacent in the K-d
space, you gain about a factor of 2 in the case of such misalignments.
I’m not sure if this is at every tree level or as a constant factor
of about 2 overall.</p>
<p>Other traversal orders may provide better performance for some data
distributions; for example, an approximate TSP solution might be
better at keeping the intervals smaller, and thus permit better
pruning.  Some applications might even be able to get away with doing
the simplest thing — leaving the records purely in insertion order
--- because the insertion order already had enough locality in the
relevant attributes to make queries adequately efficient.  For
example, in a zooming user interface, most queries for drawable
objects are restricted to a particular (x, y, size) interval, and
generally when you create new objects, you create them in a small
area in a small range of sizes.</p>
<p>If the records are instead sorted in a lexicographic order by some
sequence of attributes, such as (x, y), then the performance
characteristics are equivalent to a normal sorted SQL index: criteria
<code>x=x0</code> or <code>X=x0 and Y=y0</code> are evaluated in logarithmic time, while a
bare criterion <code>Y=y0</code> is nearly as slow as sequential search.  Again,
this happens without changing the definition of the index tree, just
rebuilding it for the new sort order.</p>
<p>Suppose you instead append some new random records to the end of the
record sequence.  As discussed above, this means that most queries
will have to traverse not only their normal path but also much of the
path down to these new update records, in case one of them contains a
relevant record; the standard index update takes care of this
automatically.  But until you have a whole leafnode full of extra
records, the number of extra nodes each query needs to visit is just a
single linear path — 8 nodes in the above example.  Each additional
leafnode normally adds just a single additional node, for a total of 9
nodes in the above example, or occasionally 10 or even more rarely 11.</p>
<p>This is recognizable as the standard database approach of having an
“update file” that every query must examine sequentially in addition
to its usual index traversal, but it is in some sense simpler — the
index structure handles it automatically.  In a sense this is just an
extension of the earlier-described property, that the same index
structure is valid for different sorting orders — in this case, we
have different sorting orders within the same file, one part of the
file sorted in a useful way, while another part is unsorted and
requires a sequential search.</p>
<p>We can extend this to a whole “LSM-tree” or “log-structured merge
tree” approach like the one used by LevelDB or Lucene: if you have
8,388,608 sorted records, followed by 4,194,304 separately sorted
records, followed by 2,097,152 sorted records, then most queries will
do no pruning in the first few levels of the tree search, then doing a
search within each segment in the usual efficient fashion.  At any
time if we we atomically replace any substring of the file with a
reordered version of itself, as well as the relevant index nodes, the
system remains valid, but potentially handles queries more
efficiently.</p>
<p>It’s often advantageous to handle record updates as well as insertions
through such an update file, because it avoids spreading the updates
all over the file and frustrating early pruning during query
evaluation.  To strictly maintain the validity of the index in such a
case, you need to somehow null out the outdated versions of the
records, replacing them with some kind of N/A or NaN or broken-heart
value, one which participates in the min and max computations by just
being left out.  This might require also maintaining explicit rather
than implicit record counts in tree nodes.  Upon nulling out a record
in this way, you can either update its ancestor nodes in the
index — preserving the index’s precise nature — or you can leave the index
untouched, so that the index is only a conservative approximation of
the actual data.</p>
<p>The flip side of this ordering-indexing orthogonality is that you can
rebuild the index with different parameters — a different leaf-node
size, branching factor, or indexed set of attributes, for
example — without sorting the records again.</p>
<h2>Conservative approximation of queries</h2>
<p>To answer a query such as</p>
<pre><code>select * from foo where (x-10)*(x-10) + (y-2)*(y-2) &lt; 100;
</code></pre>
<p>we begin by constructing a conservative approximation</p>
<pre><code>where x between 0 and 20 and y between -8 and 12;
</code></pre>
<p>which can potentially be answered efficiently by this index structure.
An alternative conservative approximation with better precision would
be</p>
<pre><code>where x between 0 and 20 and y between -6 and 10
or x between 2 and 18 and y between -8 and 12;
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>where x between 0 and 2 and y between -6 and 10
or x between 2 and 18 and y between -8 and 12
or x between 18 and 20 and y between -6 and 10;
</code></pre>
<p>Records returned by the conservative approximation must then be tested
against the precise criterion.</p>
<p>Alternatively, instead of testing the multidimensional interval
covered by each index node against such a multidimensional interval,
you might be able to do better by testing it against the original
precise criterion, using interval or affine arithmetic.</p>
<h2>Evaluating nearest-K queries</h2>
<p>Consider again my introductory example</p>
<pre><code>select * from foo order by abs(bar - 13) desc limit 10;
</code></pre>
<p>The standard way of evaluating such a query, lacking a functional
index on abs(bar - 13) — which won’t work for abs(bar - 2), for
example — is to compute a sort or partial sort over all the records,
which involves examining all the records’ bar attribute at least once.</p>
<p>You could imagine doing this query with a series of queries like the
following:</p>
<pre><code>select abs(bar - 13) as k, * from foo where k &lt; 1 order by k desc limit 10;
select abs(bar - 13) as k, * from foo where k &lt; 2 order by k desc limit 10;
select abs(bar - 13) as k, * from foo where k &lt; 4 order by k desc limit 10;
select abs(bar - 13) as k, * from foo where k &lt; 8 order by k desc limit 10;
</code></pre>
<p>and stop once you got enough records from one of the queries.  Each of
these queries can be efficiently evaluated by the index structure
described above, repeating the same tree traversal as the previous
query, but pruning perhaps fewer nodes.</p>
<p>A more efficient approach is to do the traversal once, storing all the
pruned nodes in a priority queue according to <em>by how much</em> they were
excluded.  This allows you to revisit enough of them to ensure that
you have found all the points within the radius at which you found the
Nth-best point you’ve found so far (N=10 above).  That point won’t
necessarily be in one of the nodes whose intervals are nearest to the
query point, either in upper bound or lower bound.</p>
<h2>Evaluating minimum, maximum, and top-N queries</h2>
<p>Consider these queries:</p>
<pre><code>select min(x) from foo;
select min(x) from foo where y = 41;
select min(x) from foo where y between 38 and 42;
select * from foo where y between 38 and 42 order by x desc limit 5;
</code></pre>
<p>If you have an interval-annotated tree built for attribute <code>x</code>, and
you’re updating it precisely rather than conservatively, the first
query can be answered instantly — it’s stored in the root node of
the tree.  The second and third queries are not instant, but if there
are contiguous ranges of records all matching the selection criterion,
it is unnecessary to examine each record individually; you can use the
min(x) annotation from their tree nodes instead.</p>
<p>The fourth query is somewhat more interesting, because once we have
done enough traversal to define the set of records matching the
selection criterion (as a smaller set of tree nodes covering disjoint
parts of the file), we would like to return them starting from the
largest <em>x</em>.  Well, we can look at the max(x) annotations to figure
out beneath which node in the set the largest x (say 112) is to be
found, then recursively trace down through the tree from that node to
find some record with x = 112.  <em>Then we remove it from the set</em>,
by removing the tree node we had found it from, adding that
node’s children, if any, and then recursively repeating that
process for the child node by which we found the record;
this leaves us in a position to repeat the
process four more times.  By maintaining the nodes in a priority queue
ordered by max(x), we can do this update quite efficiently.</p>
<h2>Column-oriented index storage</h2>
<p>Above I said that for an index covering two 32-bit attributes, each
node will occupy 16 bytes, and in my analyses of locality I assumed
they were contiguous in memory.  But in the case where a query only
needs to examine one of the attributes, it would be better to store
the trees for the two attributes separately — the query will need to
transfer half as many cache lines from RAM, and perhaps an extra level
near the root of the tree will fit into the first page.</p>
<h2>Pointer files</h2>
<p>In cases where the records are sorted in an inconvenient order, you
can do the usual database-index thing of making a sorted file of
pointers to the records, perhaps augmented with the sort keys, and
build the index tree on that.  In the case where you use a simple
lexicographical sort, this is just a normal database index, but you
also have the possibility of using a different order.</p>
<h2>Some explorations of a generalization of the index structure, and a surprising connection with mathematical morphology</h2>
<p>The tree search pruning merely depends on being able to efficiently
compute the bounds of the search key in certain substrings of the
file; you could imagine using some other structure to accelerate that
computation, rather than just a tree for a given set of substrings.</p>
<p>An alternative structure is the preprocessing for the Urbach-Wilkinson
erosion algorithm described in <a href="../notes/bresenham-erosion.html">Some notes on morphology, including improvements on Urbach and Wilkinson’s erosion/dilation algorithm</a>: given some
string of pixels, you can compute summary strings of maxima of all
substrings of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., pixels, starting at all the
possible offsets.  Then the maximum of an arbitrary-length substring
can be computed in constant time by finding two
potentially-overlapping substrings, typically within the same level of
summary, whose union is the you want to find the maximum of.</p>
<p>More briefly, say <em>S</em><sub>0,<em>j</em></sub> is pixel <em>j</em> of the string of
pixels, and define</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>S</em><sub><em>i</em>,<em>j</em></sub> = <em>S</em><sub><em>i</em>-1, <em>j</em></sub> ∨
  <em>S</em><sub><em>i</em>-1, <em>j</em> + 2<sup><em>i</em>-1</sup></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>whenever all of the subscripts are within bounds, and <em>x</em> ∨ <em>y</em> gives
the maximum of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.  This gives us the <em>N</em>-ary maxima
∨<sub><em>j</em></sub> of all the size-2<sup><em>i</em></sup> substrings</p>
<blockquote>
<p>∨<sub><em>j</em> ∈ [<em>m</em>, <em>m</em> + 2<sup><em>i</em></sup>)</sub> <em>S</em><sub>0, <em>j</em></sub>
  = S<sub><em>i</em>, <em>m</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and from that we can compute the maximum of an arbitrary range of
pixels as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>∨<sub><em>j</em> ∈ [<em>m</em>, <em>n</em>]</sub><em>S</em><sub>0, <em>j</em></sub> =
  <em>S</em><sub><em>a</em>, <em>j</em></sub> ∨
  <em>S</em><sub><em>a</em>, <em>j</em> + <em>n</em> - <em>m</em> - 2<sup><em>a</em></sup></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>a</em> is chosen such that <em>n</em> - <em>m</em> + 1 ∈ [2<sup><em>a</em></sup>,
2<sup><em>a</em> + 1</sup>) to prevent a gap from occurring between the two
size-2<sup><em>a</em></sup> substrings.</p>
<p>If we precompute all the <em>S</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, of which there are a
logarithmic number, we can do this in constant time.</p>
<p>Of course all of the above goes <em>mutatis mutandis</em> for minima rather
than maxima.</p>
<p>An interesting property of this structure is that, without any further
metadata, we need only logarithmic time to trace any range maximum
thus computed back to one of the pixels where it originated; for
example, <em>S</em><sub>4, 3</sub> is either equal to <em>S</em><sub>3, 3</sub> or
it’s equal to <em>S</em><sub>3, 11</sub>, and <em>S</em><sub>3, 11</sub> is either
equal to <em>S</em><sub>2, 11</sub> or to <em>S</em><sub>2, 15</sub>.  By following
the trail this way, we can figure out where in the range to find the
maximum pixel value.  In particular, this allows us to find the
runner-up value in logarithmic time: if it turns out that the maximum
value came from pixel 12, we can split the range into two halves that
exclude pixel 12 and calculate their maxima, one of which is the
runner-up.</p>
<p>This is suggestively similar to the query algorithms described above,
and as it turns out,
we can view the interval-annotated-tree structure we started with as a
sort of decimated version of this layer-cake structure, where we only
keep <em>S</em><sub><em>i</em>, <em>j</em></sub> if <em>j</em> is divisible by
2<sup><em>i</em>+<em>k</em></sup>, where 2<sup><em>k</em></sup> gives the number of records
in a leaf node, and perhaps if <em>i</em> is divisible by some
number — above I used 3.  This makes for a much smaller index, but it also
makes even the simplest queries take logarithmic time rather than
constant time, and it adds a constant factor to logarithmic-time
queries.  Intermediate points on this time-space tradeoff spectrum may
be worth considering.  For example, you could have nodes further up
the tree overlap somewhat, without storing every possible offset.</p>
<h2>Annotations using lattices and semilattices other than total orderings</h2>
<p>The above data structures generalize to general lattices and
semilattices.  As an example closer to normal databases, you could
consider indexing some attribute with small Bloom filters, using
bitwise OR between the Bloom filters rather than min or max.  Suppose
you use 256 bits (16 bytes) and a single hash function:</p>
<table cellpadding=3 style="text-align: right">
       <tr> <th>Records indexed <th>Expected fullness <th>False positive probability
       <tr> <td>1               <td>0.4%              <td>0.4%
       <tr> <td>32              <td>12%               <td>12%
       <tr> <td>128             <td>39%               <td>39%
       <tr> <td>256             <td>63%               <td>63%
</table>

<p>So you could skip over about a third of your 256-record chunks after
just checking a bit in their Bloom filters, and almost 90% of your
32-record chunks (although there’s a conditional probability there
that I’m not calculating — if you’re looking at a 32-record leafnode
at all, it might be because it’s, say, one of eight children of a
256-record that had the right bit set, and at least one of those eight
children needs to have that bit, and so on average almost two of them
will.)</p>
<p>This suggests that aggregating Bloom filters in this way is only
useful over a couple of orders of magnitude, and also that you should
use a low branching factor like 2 in this case.</p>
<p>I think this gets worse rather than better with more hash functions:
false positive probability goes down for single records and small
groups, and up for large groups.  Consider the case with three hash
functions:</p>
<table cellpadding=3 style="text-align: right">
       <tr> <th>Records indexed <th>Expected fullness <th>False positive probability
       <tr> <td>1               <td>1.2%              <td>0.0002%
       <tr> <td>32              <td>31%               <td>3.1%
       <tr> <td>128             <td>78%               <td>47%
       <tr> <td>256             <td>95%               <td>86%
</table>

<p>The problem is that Bloom filters are most efficient when they’re
about half full, but trying to calculate the parent bitvector from the
child bitvectors means that they have to be the same size.  You could
consider giving that up — maybe you use three hash functions, and
for 16-record leafnodes, you use 64-bit (8-byte) bitvectors, giving
you a 14.9% false-positive probability; while for their 32-record
parents, you use 128-bit (16-byte) bitvectors with 14.8% false
positives; and for their 64-record parents, 256 bits (32 bytes) and
14.7%; and their 128-record parents, 512 bits and 14.7%; and so on.
But then if you delete a record or update it in place, you either have
to let the Bloom filters decay a bit, or you have to rehash all 128 of
them.  At some point you have to stop expanding the filters or
deleting a single key ultimately requires rehashing the whole file.</p>
<p>Bloom filters can do some operations that go beyond simple membership
testing.  For example, if two Bloom filters are built compatibly, you
can efficiently compute not only their union (as above) but also the
Bloom filter of their intersection.  This is potentially useful for
joins somehow.</p>
<p>There are also cases where you have honest-to-goodness bitvectors
stored in a database, perhaps in a SAT solver or a database of
combinational-logic circuits, and it might be useful to query not only
for a particular bit pattern but for things that have supersets or
subsets of it set.</p>
<h2>Affine-arithmetic nodes</h2>
<p>Suppose that instead of annotating each node with just the (min, max)
values of each indexed attribute, you annotate it with a coefficient
which gives a <em>predicted</em> attribute value when multiplied by its
offset within that node, and a (min, max) value pair for the
<em>difference</em> between the predicted value and the real value.  If the
coefficient is 0, then the (min, max) values are the same as before,
but if there’s some correlation between the attribute value and the
record position (at least locally), this may allow much tighter
bounds, and in particular much faster range narrowing — interpolation
search on steroids.</p>
<p>(You might want some kind of extended-precision data type to handle
the necessary arithmetic on string keys.)</p>
<p>This is quite close to a totally trippy paper from Google Research on
training neural nets as database index nodes, whose authors and title
I forget.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
