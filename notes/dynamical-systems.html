(6 minutes)</div><p>Playing with this scientific calculator and thinking about the Mill
CPU and write-once memory (such as, roughly, NOR flash), and then
spending some quality time with Gnumeric and watching Joel Spolsky and
Martin Shkreli coax magic from Microsoft Excel, it occurred to me that
there was maybe an interesting and expressive programming model that
captures pointwise calculations on vectors as well as generalized
prefix sums over them.</p>
<p>The programming model is as follows.  You specify a sequence of
updates to apparently scalar variables, such as</p>
<pre><code>x := y + 1
z := z + x
</code></pre>
<p>These updates are run, in sequence, repeatedly.</p>
<p>As syntactic sugar, we use → for assignment, put the variable on the
right side, make the assignment an expression and return its value
from the assignment expression (as in Lisp or C), and support
augmented assignment operators as in C, but spelled +→, -→, ·→, and so
on.  This allows us to abbreviate the above example as follows:</p>
<pre><code>y + 1 → x +→ z
</code></pre>
<p>By itself, this is just a formalism for deterministic dynamical system
evolution rules.  But you might want to visualize a trajectory or the
trajectories of a dynamical system, such as the famous Minsky circle:</p>
<pre><code>x · k +→ y · k -→ x
</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to consider the dynamical system as a function from
initial values to trajectories, which we could conceptualize as
vectors of successive values taken by the different variables.  From
that point of view, we are no longer overwriting the previous value;
we are merely appending to a vector of values.</p>
<p>Note that in particular this expression has a somewhat APLish meaning
in this interpretation:</p>
<pre><code>x + y → z
</code></pre>
<p>If x and y are vectors that something else is building at the same
time, corresponding items in them will be added and the sums appended
to z; if one of them is a scalar (i.e. a value that doesn’t change
during the loop), then it will be added to each value of the other and
the sums appended to z; if they are both scalars, then some
undetermined number of copies of the sum will be appended to z.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it is natural to add an operator to look back
in history, like Git’s <code>~</code> operator; <code>HEAD</code> is the current value of
<code>HEAD</code>, while <code>HEAD~1</code> is its previous value, and <code>HEAD~2</code> is the
value before that (equivalent to <code>HEAD~1~1</code>).  For example, if we
initially have two values in <code>x</code>, we could write linear extrapolation
to the next value as follows:</p>
<pre><code>2 · x - x~1 → x
</code></pre>
<p>As a more complex example, we can write the Goertzel algorithm as</p>
<pre><code>x + b · s - s~1 → s - c · s~1 → y
</code></pre>
<p>where b is 2 cos ω₀ and c is exp(-i ω₀).  Note that this is
potentially confusing in that the expressions <code>s</code> and <code>s~1</code> occur
twice in the same formula with different meanings.  It might be less
confusing to write this as follows:</p>
<pre><code>x + b · s - s~1 → s
s - c · s~1 → y
</code></pre>
<p>Now, in this form, this is sort of incomplete; if <code>x</code> decays to the
latest value added to <code>x</code>, it only implements the Goertzel algorithm
if stuff is getting added to <code>x</code> while the above code is running.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways we could handle that.  One is
that we could package the above code into a function, and define a
function composition operation that implicitly gloms together the
various state transition functions into a single evolution rule.  A
more conventional alternative would be to provide a while or foreach
construct.  In this case, due to the one-dimensionality of the
temporal constructs described thus far, a foreach construct could pun
the sequence with its iterator.  If we use <code>@</code>, we get:</p>
<pre><code>x @ x + b · s - s~1 → s - c · s~1 → y
</code></pre>
<p>This in some sense creates a new local variable <code>x</code> inside the scope
of the loop (the right side of the operator) that is an alias for the
nonempty prefixes of the original <code>x</code> on sequential iterations of the
loop.</p>
<p>Augmenting this with a <code>:</code> sequence-construction operator like
Octave’s (but zero-based), we now have a way to control the number of
iterations of something like Minsky’s circle algorithm; we can write,
for example:</p>
<pre><code>1→x→y
:1000@x·k+→y·k-→x
</code></pre>
<p>However, I think it’s useful to consider evolution rules like
<code>x·k+→y·k-→x</code> as entities in themselves rather than incomplete code
snippets.  It may be useful to compose them, perhaps with β-reduction
and α-renaming, as part of a larger evolution rule involving more
variables, or to attempt to differentiate them with respect to their
inputs, or to attempt to find inverses for them, in general or from a
particular point.</p>
<p>You could iterate over multiple sequences in parallel; vector dot
product can be expressed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>0 → t
u, v @ u · v +→ t
</code></pre>
<p>Nested loops make sense in only a few circumstances without adding a
way to store arrays with more dimensions, but for example, here’s a
time-domain FIR filter convolving <code>x</code> with kernel <code>k</code>, storing
intermediate sums in a variable <code>t</code>:</p>
<pre><code>:#k → n
x[#k:] @ 0 → t
         k, n @ x~n · k +→ t
         t → y
</code></pre>
<p>In an environment with very limited screen space, such as a scientific
calculator or an Excel formula, you could write that without
indentation, whitespace, or newlines:</p>
<pre><code>:#k→n;x[#k:]@0→t;(k,n@x~n·k+→t);t→y
</code></pre>
<p>That’s 36 characters, which should fit on the screen even on a fairly
low-end scientific calculator.</p>
<p>This data model is more convenient in many cases than Excel’s, but
somewhat less powerful, because it doesn’t natively support
two-dimensional arrays.  But maybe the right thing is actually to have
this kind of merged native support for one-dimensional arrays and
scalars, but require some kind of extra operation for two-dimensional
arrays, the way C and Perl5 require an extra operation to dereference
pointers.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
