(4 minutes)</div><p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/binary-array-set">Nayuki wrote a very clear description of a data structure she calls a
binary array set, or
BAS</a>.  It’s a linked list
of sorted arrays in power-of-2 increasing sizes, merged upon overflow;
insertion is θ(1) amortized (Θ(N) worst case), and membership testing
is average-case and worst-case Θ((log N)²).</p>
<p>I asserted to a friend of mine that incrementalizing it to get Θ(1)
worst-case insertion time was straightforward.  The transformation
also gives you an FP-persistent† version of the BAS data structure.
Here I sketch the details.</p>
<h2>Merging strategies</h2>
<p>With power-of-2 array sizes, if you happen to be at a state with 1024
items, the immediately previous state will have had array sizes of 1,
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512.  The item in the array of size
1 will have been merged zero times, the two items in the array of size
2 will have been merged one time, the size-4 array will have been
merged from two size-2 arrays and thus each item in it has been merged
twice, and so on; the 512-item array contains items that have all been
merged 9 times.  That is, the items in an array of size 2ⁿ have been
merged <em>n</em> times.  So, in fact, under this merging policy, amortized
insertion time per item is not constant; it is Θ(log N).</p>
<p>I thought we could do better using a multi-way merge.  All the items
in the 1024-item array have been through the same number of merges
(10) because the behavior upon inserting the 1024th item is to merge
it to produce an array of 2 items, which then must be merged and
discarded to produce an array of 4 items, etc, doing a total of 10 · 1
+ 9 · 2 + 8 · 4 + ... 2 · 256 + 1 · 512 = 2036 work, where each unit
is a comparison and a couple of pointer copies.  If we instead did a
single 9-way merge using a 9-item binary heap, the average work per
item is about 3.17, so we end up doing about 3200+1024 work instead.
Memory locality is surely better; not counting the accesses to the
tiny heap, we only have to do 1024 work this way.</p>
<p>This is not obviously better, and although I haven’t done the analysis
for real, I don’t see a strong reason to expect it to get better
asymptotically.  So it’s probably best just to use the simple
strategy.</p>
<h2>Incrementalizing</h2>
<p>The basic idea is that every time you perform an insertion, you also
do enough merge work to ensure that the merging stays ahead of
insertion.  This is somewhat tricky, in that we can’t simply stop
merging newly inserted data until the completion of a large merge
further down the chain; that would kill our search-time guarantee.  So
at times a large merge must be paused while a small merge is
performed.</p>

<p>† “Persistent” unfortunately has two conflicting meanings when it
comes to data structures; functional programmers use it to mean that
modifying the data structure does not make its previous states
inaccessible.  By “FP-persistent” I mean this meaning, not the more
common meaning of “retrievable after rebooting your computer”.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
