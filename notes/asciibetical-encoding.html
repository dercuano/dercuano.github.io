(2 minutes)</div><p>I thought I had written some notes about this previously, but I can’t
find them right now.  I want a serialization for relatively general
data structures (say, at least the S-expression or JSON data model)
that possesses a useful homomorphism between some kind of natural
ordering on the original data structures and the lexicographical
ordering of the byte strings they serialize to.  That is, if E is the
serialization encoding, I want E(X) &lt; E(Y) iff X &lt; Y.</p>
<p>This is for five reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>LevelDB: LevelDB can iterate over the keys that are ASCIIbetically
  within a certain range.  In fact, that’s the <em>only</em> kind of
  iteration it supports.</li>
<li>0MQ: ZeroMQ and Nanomsg can efficiently filter messages from a
  pub-sub topic that begin with a given substring.</li>
<li>Compressed indexing: Patricia and related trie structures, as well
  as FM-indices and related data structures, can efficiently retrieve
  and even compress data — but they only support retrieval by
  lexicographical prefixes, not by other arbitrary orderings.</li>
<li>Suffix arrays: suffix arrays can efficiently find all the
  occurrences of a substring in a large file, and now there are simple
  O(N) suffix-array construction algorithms.</li>
<li>Radix sorting: while comparison sorting is O(N log N), radix sorting
  is O(N).</li>
</ul>
<p>To take advantage of these properties, I often end up writing some
kind of simple ad-hoc serialization code for the data at hand, which
often turns out to have bugs in it, and almost never generalizes to
other kinds of data that aren’t in the data I’m looking at.  (For
example, if I separate fields with spaces, I run into ordering errors
once I have data containing ASCII control characters or spaces.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (123 notes)
