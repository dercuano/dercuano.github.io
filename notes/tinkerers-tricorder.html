(27 minutes)</div><p>My friend Nick and I were talking about a tool called the Tinkerer's
Tricorder, which, if it existed, would tell you everything interesting
about an electrical component as soon as you connected it across its
terminals.  Inductance, capacitance, resistance, voltage, frequency,
diode characteristics, resonant frequency, Q, and so on — all with no
danger of damaging the device!</p>
<p>Some of Nick's notes are at
<a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=5366&amp;p=52238">http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=5366&amp;p=52238</a>.</p>
<p>I had wasted some time earlier that same day trying to debug a circuit
without any test equipment.  I ended up programming an Arduino to be a
crude volt/ohmmeter.  Despite its imprecision and the need to use a
laptop to see its readout, it had three big advantages over a standard
multimeter:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It, or rather the laptop, recorded a series of measurements instead
  of a single one, so I could see not just the current state but
  recent states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It measured both voltage and resistance without any need to switch
  modes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of all, it could be simply downloaded and installed on existing
  hardware, without requiring any additional hardware — not so much as
  a resistor soldered across a pair of pins!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I'd like a Downloadable Tinkerer's Tricorder — the closest possible
approach to the Tinkerer's Tricorder on common hardware like an AVR
microcontroller or an Arduino, without needing any nonstandard
hardware — not even so much as a resistor or capacitor soldered across
a couple of pins.  You just reprogram the flash, connect the device
under test between two pins, and the AVR tells you what it is.  Maybe
you go through some kind of calibration step if you want accurate
results.</p>
<p>Nick's project is far more capable, but I think its parts cost is
comparable to the cost of a prebuilt LCR meter.</p>
<p>How capable could a Downloadable Tinkerer's Tricorder be, struggling
under the limits of common AVR hardware?</p>
<h2>What an AVR pin can do to the outside world</h2>
<p>Basically an AVR digital GPIO pin can be in one of four states: output
high, output low, input high, and input low.  Although some exotic
Arduinos have DACs, common Arduinos don't have anything but digital
GPIO pins plus an ADC.  (This is deeply unfortunate, since the core of
the AVRs' successive-approximation ADC is a DAC — but its output isn't
routable to any pins!)</p>
<p>Output high ties the pin to the 5V rail with relatively low impedance;
it can source up to 40 milliamps, but if you connect the pin directly
to ground, the chip doesn't blow up; it's internally limited to about
40 milliamps.  This means that, at least at high currents, the
internal output impedance is about 25Ω.  This is convenient for
connecting AVRs to LEDs and speakers; it pretty much guarantees you
won't blow up the AVR, the LED, or the speaker no matter how ignorant
you are, unless you hook the LED up to your power supply instead of
the AVR.</p>
<p>Output low is similar, but ties the pin to the ground rail through the
≈25Ω impedance.</p>
<p>Input high ties the pin to the 5V rail via a pullup resistor, which is
nominally 20-50kΩ on the ATMega328, which is not what you'd call a
really fucking precise specification.</p>
<p>Input low tristates the pin, i.e. sets it at the very high input
impedance characteristic of CMOS inputs, around a megohm; the maximum
rating from the datasheet is that these pins draw up to 10 μA.</p>
<p>The pins are also diode-clamped to the power rails, which should
protect them from voltage spikes if you're testing an inductor and
slam a pin to input state.  The clamping diodes aren't well-specified
in the datasheets, but various AVRFreaks threads claim that these
diodes are equipped to handle only up to about 1.5mA before possibly
going into latch-up and killing your chip.  The ATMega328P datasheet
instead gives a spec for the voltage range: -0.5 V to VCC + 0.5V.</p>
<p>The datasheet max specified I/O pin capacitance is 10 pF, although I
suspect 1 pF is probably more typical.  I haven't measured.</p>
<h2>What an AVR can measure</h2>
<p>The usual AVRs, including the ATMega328, have a 10-bit ADC with a
sample-and-hold frontend, which measures relative to either the
power-supply voltage (typically 5 volts), and an internal 1.0-1.2 volt
analog bandgap reference voltage; the ADC is claimed to have a 38.5kHz
input bandwidth, but people have reported success clocking it up to
4MHz and still getting an Effective Number Of Bits around 5.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the AVR can use its ADC to measure an internal
temperature sensor, supposedly accurate to ±10°C.  This is important
because it means that you can, in theory, compensate for thermal
variation in things like pull-up resistor resistance.  (The two major
factors of variation in the behavior of a given electronic device are
supply voltage and temperature.  You can apparently measure the
internal bandgap relative to the supply voltage, getting a value
somewhere around 200, and thus measuring the reciprocal of the supply
voltage, by setting ADMUX to 01x01110.)</p>
<p>I'm assuming the internal voltage reference is usable without any
external hardware, even a capacitor attached to the AREF pin, but I'm
not sure.</p>
<p>10 bits isn't much, but the device can measure time much more
precisely.  The internal RC oscillator is nominally accurate to 10% (3
bits), unless calibrated by the user, in which case it's accurate to
within 1% (7 bits).  However, in the common case that the AVR uses an
external quartz crystal, its timing accuracy depends on that crystal's
accuracy, which is normally about 0.005% (15 bits).  Current normal
Arduinos (Pro, Pro Mini, Uno) use a 16MHz Murata ceramic resonator
that's accurate to 0.5% (8 bits), and older Arduinos (everything
before Duemilanove, including Mini) use a quartz crystal.  The AVR
microcontrollers currently used can run at 20MHz, but the Arduinos run
them at 16MHz for compatibility with the 16MHz ATMega8 used in the
first Arduino.</p>
<p>(It appears that temperature and supply voltage are the major factors
in the speed variation of these resonators, says <a href="http://softsolder.com/2010/01/22/arduino-pro-ceramic-resonator-frequency-compensation/">this guy who was
tracking his against atomic clock broadcasts from WWVB</a> and <a href="http://jorisvr.nl/arduino_frequency.html">this
guy who was measuring against GPS</a>.  So maybe with the temperature
and supply voltage sensors, you could reduce the errors.
Temperature-controlled crystal oscillators can reach three orders of
magnitude better than raw crystals, i.e. 0.05 ppm temperature
stability (24 bits).)</p>
<h2>Low voltage isn't practical</h2>
<p>Nick tells me ESR meters usually work at very low voltage to enable
in-circuit component testing without activating any nearby transistors
— under 0.1V.  I don't think that's practical for the Downloadable
Tinkerer's Tricorder because the chips I want it to run on don't have
controllable-voltage output pins.</p>
<h2>Avoiding damaging devices under test</h2>
<p>A tricky thing is that, when you hook up some unknown device to your
AVR, the AVR doesn't have the opportunity to consult its datasheet
before applying power to it in order to figure out what it is.  So it
seems like a good idea to design the tricorder's strategy to minimize
the risk of this.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious kind of damage is overheating.  Too much
voltage across almost any electrical device will cause it to generate
more heat than it can dissipate until it gets really hot, hot enough
to damage or destroy it.  Since we're talking about a max of 5V at
40mA here, or 200mW, this is certainly a possible danger here; there
are plenty of tiny resistors and things out there that can't dissipate
200mW at any kind of reasonable temperature.  However, for macroscopic
components, we can rely on their thermal mass to allow us to dissipate
200mW for a short period of time — if we can manage to use a duty
cycle of 5%, we should be able to use 5V with near impunity, at least
on discrete components, since we'd dissipate an average of 10mW.</p>
<p>Even the lowest-current-rated discrete diodes I could find on Digi-key
were rated for 10mA average, so I think briefly passing 40mA through
an unknown diode should be safe.</p>
<p>Integrated circuits are more delicate when it comes to brief
overheating; a presentation I dug up from Cypress on "electrical
over-stress" mentions, among other things, "melted or vaporized bond
wires", with horrifying photos.  Still, I don't think we're talking
about 40mA there.</p>
<p>MOS circuits in general can be destroyed by overvoltage, even very
briefly: it punches holes in the "O" layer in between the "M" and "S"
by means of avalanche breakdown, and those holes are permanent.
However, I don't think there are any MOS devices out there that will
be destroyed in this way by 5 volts, so I don't think this is a real
danger.</p>
<p>I seem to recall that semiconductor junctions can be damaged by high
current density, even without high temperatures, but I can't find a
citation for that now.</p>
<p>Electrolytic capacitors in general can be damaged by reverse-biasing,
sometimes exploding spectacularly.  The super-teensy tantalum
capacitors are particularly famous for this.  I dug up a NASA paper on
tantalum capacitor damage by reverse bias, and it seems like the
damage takes place by means of a microamp (!!) or so of current.  But
it doesn't seem to happen below about 3 volts, and at 3 volts, it
takes several hundred seconds.  Even at 5 volts, it takes several tens
of seconds.  I suspect that short exposures to reverse bias can be
corrected by a similar and rapid exposure to forward bias, reforming
the dielectric layer that may have been disrupted.</p>
<p>Electrolytic capacitors, however, have the great advantage in this
case that they have very high capacitance, 0.1μF or greater (typically
100μF or greater), even when back-biased (until they start
conducting).  If you're charging an 0.1μF capacitor through a 20kΩ
pull-up resistor, your RC constant is 2ms.  This should give you
plenty of time to determine that you have a lagging voltage waveform,
and therefore a capacitor, and turn the current around before the
voltage reaches 3V.</p>
<p>Diodes in general will conduct if you put enough reverse voltage
across them, either by avalanche breakdown or zener breakdown; diodes
that are not designed for this will be destroyed.  LEDs tend to have
fairly low reverse voltage limits, but Nick tells me they're still
over 5V, so not to worry.  (I did find a Skyworks small-signal
Schottky diode with a 1V maximum reverse voltage.  But I could only
find three diodes that fragile in the entire Digi-Key catalog.)</p>
<h2>Measuring voltage</h2>
<p>So, the simplest thing to measure would seem to be a DC voltage
applied to a pin, or across two pins.  The ADC can measure it
directly, as long as it's positive.</p>
<p>For 1.1 to 5V, ADC values of 205 or so to 1023 measure the voltage
with 0.25% to 0.05% quantization error: 0.005 volts.  Of course, this
is relative to the supply voltage, which probably isn't regulated to
within even 0.25%; <a href="http://jorisvr.nl/arduino_frequency.html">Joris van Rantwijk found that a single GPIO pin
dumping 30mA introduced a 1% error</a>.</p>
<p>For 0 to 1.1V, you can set the internal bandgap reference as the
reference voltage, so as to measure with millivolt precision.
However, the internal bandgap reference is specified to have ±10%
error; presumably it's highly stable over time on a given chip, but
varies from chip to chip.</p>
<p>If you can connect the voltage source between two pins, instead of to
a single pin (implying that the voltage doesn't share a common ground
with the AVR), then you get a couple of additional benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you set pin A as low input and pin B as low output, then you'll
  measure a positive voltage on pin A if the positive end of the
  source is connected to pin A, and a zero voltage (and some heat
  dissipation in the clamping diode) if the negative end of the source
  is.  I think you can also measure a positive voltage on pin B in
  that case, since whatever current is being sourced by the clamping
  diode to ground on pin A is being sunk through the nonzero output
  impedance on pin B.  But in that case, you can set pin A as low
  output and pin B as low input, and you'll measure the positive
  voltage on pin B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This also means you can measure AC voltages, although only either
  the upper or lower half of the waveform at any one time, by
  switching back and forth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For 3.9 to 5.0V, you can get higher precision measurement.  Suppose
  WOLOG that you've measured that pin A is the more positive end of
  the source.  Then you set pin B as low input and pin A as high
  output.  Now pin B sees a voltage of (5.0 - DUT) volts, which it can
  then measure with millivolt precision by using the internal bandgap
  reference.  This trick is limited by the stability and precision of
  your 5V reference, which, unfortunately, is probably worse than
  0.25%.  (You can re-measure it to 0.25% against the internal bandgap
  frequently, but you can't get the 0.02% precision this seems to
  promise without a more precisely controlled reference voltage.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This range of tricks gives you variable voltage precision as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>-5.0 to -3.9 V: 1mV</li>
<li>-3.9 to -1.1 V: 5mV</li>
<li>-1.1 to 1.1 V: 1mV</li>
<li>1.1 to 3.9 V: 5mV</li>
<li>3.9 to 5.0 V: 1mV</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives you at least 0.25% precision for -5 to -2.2 volts, -1.1 to
-0.4 volts, 0.4 to 1.1 volts, and 2.2 to 5 volts; at least 0.45%
precision from -5 to -0.22 volts and 0.22 to 5 volts; and at least 10%
precision from -5 to -0.01 volts and 0.01 to 5 volts.</p>
<p>(As usual, linear analog-to-digital conversion is a bad deal here.  If
we wanted 0.45% accuracy for anything up to 5 volts and had 10 bits to
work with, a smooth exponential distribution of levels 5/1.0045**n for
n up to 1024 would give us 0.45% accuracy down to 51 millivolts,
rather than 220 millivolts; that is, 10 bits would cover an entire
order of magnitude.)</p>
<p>The four different ways to configure the two pins to measure a voltage
between them (LI LO, LO LI, LI HO, HO LI) provide two different ways
to measure any given voltage, to different precisions, while only
allowing microamps of current to flow.  If these measurements
disagree, then you know the device isn't actually connected across the
terminals, or isn't a voltage source.  Since none of these
configurations allow more than microamps of current to flow, none of
them should be dangerous to electronic components that aren't
generating voltage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the voltage source is just connected to pin A, then pin A might
  read the same voltage in the LI LO and LI HO configurations (that
  is, changing the state of pin B might not affect pin A much).  But
  if pin A is floating, it's not a great idea to depend on it to do
  much of anything; it might follow pin B through internal leakage or
  capacitive coupling.  So you might try the HI LO and HI HO
  configurations instead, just in case, but perhaps only briefly — the
  pull-up resistor could source enough current to damage, say,
  back-biased tantalum capacitors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you know that you have a voltage source between your terminals, the
next thing to do is presumably to evaluate how much current it can
deliver, which you should maybe be able to do by setting both
terminals to low output (LO LO).  In this voluptuous configuration,
the negative terminal of the voltage source is forced below ground and
fed current from the clamping diode, while the positive terminal feeds
up to about 40mA of current to ground through its impedance.  You
should see 0V on one terminal and a small voltage on the other, which
voltage should increase (probably nonlinearly!) with the current being
sucked from the voltage source.  If it can provide more than about
40mA (AAA batteries can provide 500mA) you won't learn anything
useful.</p>
<p>LO LO should be safe for any component that isn't generating voltage
itself, since it's just trying to put both of its terminals at the
same voltage.</p>
<p>The trouble with LO LO or HO HO with a voltage source is that you're
almost certain to be overtaxing the poor little clamping diodes.  It
might make more sense to use LO HO or HO LO, with the appropriate
polarity to keep either of the terminals from going outside the power
rails.</p>
<h2>Measuring resistance</h2>
<p>A resistor between the two terminals will tend to bring their voltage
to equality in any of the five configurations suggested for measuring
voltage sources in the previous section (LI LO, LO LI, LI HO, HO LI,
LO LO).  In the first four configurations, the input pin will follow
the voltage on the output pin, and quite quickly too — if you have a
1pF pin capacitance and a 1MΩ resistor, your RC time constant is 1μs,
16 clock cycles on the Arduino, far too fast to digitize the charging
curve with a mere 35kHz ADC.  You might be able to beat that by doing
a lot of transitions and digitizing one sample after each transition,
at a variable delay, but you're going to be out of luck when you get
to 10kΩ resistors, let alone 100Ω resistors.</p>
<p>But if one pin is following the other like that, you can infer that
there is perhaps a resistance connected between them, and try to run
some current through it to see what happens.</p>
<p>The first thing to try is presumably HI LO or LO HI, which forms a
voltage divider between the pull-up resistor and the unknown
resistance.  If you somehow knew the resistance of the pull-up
resistor — more accurately than "20–50kΩ" — you could use this to
calculate the unknown resistance with some precision.  Without that
calibration, you're just ballparking it, although you can measure the
ratios between resistances quite accurately.</p>
<p>(In practice the pull-up isn't actually a linear resistance.)</p>
<p>For the case where the pull-up resistance curve is known accurately —
let's say 35kΩ — you have the following scale of measurements on the
HI pin:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.995V (ADC=1022 when comparing against 5V reference): R/(R+35kΩ) =
  1022/1023, so R = 36MΩ.</li>
<li>5V (ADC=1023): R &gt; 36MΩ.</li>
<li>4.990V (ADC=1021): R = 18MΩ.  Clearly the error in this range is
  enormous, but it would still be very useful to be able to tell the
  difference between a 10MΩ resistor, a 1MΩ resistor, and a blown
  resistor.  Unfortunately it's not clear that you actually get quite
  that far out; we're talking about currents around a microamp, and
  there could easily be microamp-range leakages floating around these
  pins.</li>
<li>And so reciprocally down to, say, 2.5V (ADC=512), where R = 35kΩ,
  and changes of one count actually do represent 0.2% changes in R.
  Note that at this point we don't actually care what the reference
  voltage is or how precisely we know it, because R/(R+35kΩ) is the
  ratio of voltages, regardless of what the larger voltage actually
  is.  We <em>do</em> care about the precise value of the resistor, but it's
  not clear how we can find that.</li>
<li>So on down to 1.1V or so (ADC=225), where R = 9.86kΩ and each count
  represents about 0.5% (so 0.25% error, ideally, but probably more
  like 1%.)  At that point we can switch to the internal bandgap
  reference and quadruple our resolution — but we're limited by the
  limited precision of our measurement of the bandgap reference
  relative to the total supply voltage, and now we <em>do</em> care about
  what the supply voltage is.  Still, ideally, we can measure
  resistances in this range with around 0.1% precision.</li>
<li>We hit ADC=225 and 0.5% precision again at 0.24 V, at which point R
  = 1.76kΩ.</li>
<li>We hit ADC=20 and 5% precision at 21mV, R = 148Ω.</li>
<li>ADC=10 and 10% precision at 10.7mV, R = 75Ω.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far we've only been pushing about 140μA through the resistor.  This
should be safe for almost anything (except, as mentioned earlier,
electrolytic and especially tantalum capacitors over long periods of
time.)  But if our device is behaving like a resistor — in particular,
the measurement we get here is stable over long periods of time such
as a millisecond or two, and consistent in both directions — it's
almost certainly safe to put more current through it, at least for a
while.  And we can get a more precise measurement that way if the
resistance is lower than around 1-10kΩ.</p>
<p>So if we switch to LO HO and HO LO mode, we're attempting to put a
full 5V across the putative resistor.  Now we should be able to
measure the voltage drop introduced by the pin driver (the sink) on
the LO pin, and perhaps less precisely the voltage drop on the HO pin.</p>
<p>These drivers are somewhat nonlinear — their voltage drop isn't purely
proportional to the current — but treating one of them as having a
resistance around 25Ω worked reasonably well for me in an experiment,
over about the 50-500Ω range.  Experimentation is needed.</p>
<p>This could involve pushing a full 40mA through the resistor,
dissipating 200mW, so you probably want to do it on a low duty cycle.
This will involve lots of opportunities to watch its impulse response,
which could tell you if it has much inductance or capacitance.</p>
<p>If you're switching from HO LO to LO LO, a capacitor should dump the
positive charge it's accumulated back into the formerly-HO pin,
keeping its measured voltage above zero for a bit due to the nonzero
input impedance, while a resistor will stop carrying current as soon
as you stop applying voltage.  An inductor, on the other hand, will
continue carrying current in the same direction, dragging the
formerly-HO pin's voltage below zero (unmeasurably, due to diode
clamping) but continuing to dump charge into the still-LO pin, keeping
its measured voltage above zero.</p>
<p>That's not the only possible way you could turn the pins off to stop
burning energy in the resistor.  In fact, of the 16 possible
configurations of two pins, only LO HO and HO LO apply 5 volts at low
impedance across the load; the other 14 are some variant of "off" or
"gently pulled up", so any of them would work.  However, of those 14,
only LO LO and HO HO provide low-impedance paths for current to
continue flowing in the case of an inductor.  Suddenly increasing the
impedance in a circuit with an inductor is a recipe for potentially
damaging or possibly even painful voltage spikes; we can hope that the
diode-clamped inputs are up to the stress, but it seems better to
minimize the risk.</p>
<p>Even assuming the behavior we observe is memoryless, the different
voltages applied by HI LO and HO LO (in the case where current flows)
can give us two points on the E-I curve of the device under test;
LO HI and LO HO give us two more points, although perhaps less
informative ones.  If those four points and the origin are collinear,
we have a resistor, at least over the voltage range we're testing
with.  Being able to tell if they're collinear, though, presupposes
that we have a good map of the E-I curve of the pin drivers, since
that's what we're supposedly inferring the I at high current from, and
also a well-calibrated value of the pullup resistance!</p>
<p>Reversing the bias will, among other things, distinguish a diode from
a resistor, even if the exponential E-I curve doesn't — unless it's a
zener diode with a low breakdown voltage.</p>
<h2>Measuring capacitance and inductance</h2>
<p>Capacitors can be delicate.  Inductors aren't, but chips are delicate
when connected to inductors.  So this requires some care.</p>
<p>When the external voltage drops you observe in HO LO or LO HO and LO
LO modes aren't time-invariant, you know you have either a capacitor
or an inductor; and when those voltage drops go up rather than down
over time, you know you have a capacitor, so you should be careful.
But "being careful" might mean avoiding HO LO and LO HO modes
altogether XXX</p>
