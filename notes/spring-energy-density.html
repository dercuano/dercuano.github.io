(3 minutes)</div><p>What’s the maximum energy density of a spring?  What material is best?</p>
<p>As you put more and more energy into a spring, eventually you will
break it.  The properties of the spring material put a limit on how
much energy you can store in the material before you break it.</p>
<p>Typically the relevant numbers are yield stress (or elastic limit) and
some kind of modulus of stiffness.  Some springs are stressed in shear
(like a torsion bar in torsion, or a coil spring in compression or
tension), while others are stressed in tension or compression, like
the surfaces of a leaf spring or a bow.</p>
<p>Common geometries, like the torsion bar, coil spring, or leaf spring,
have a zero-stress region in the middle of the material, with stress
increasing linearly up to the surface, where it is at a maximum.  This
geometry reduces the spring’s energy density to half of the
theoretical maximum for the material.  Other geometries, such as
tubular torsion bars or I-beam leaf springs, can reduce the wasted
weight.  Springs stressed in pure compression, like a squeezed block
of rubber, or in pure tension, like a stretched wire, do not have this
problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_modulus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_modulus</a> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shear modulus is one of several quantities for measuring the
stiffness of materials. All of them arise in the generalized Hooke's
law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Young's modulus describes the material's response to uniaxial
  stress (like pulling on the ends of a wire or putting a weight on
  top of a column),</li>
<li>the bulk modulus describes the material's response to uniform
  pressure (like the pressure at the bottom of the ocean or a deep
  swimming pool)</li>
<li>the shear modulus describes the material's response to shear
  stress (like cutting it with dull scissors).</li>
</ul>

<p>It also gives a table:</p>

they have no attribution and no units.  (Also, they have no
precision.)</p>
