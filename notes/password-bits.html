(44 minutes)</div><p>You can use a passphrase consisting of four short, common words to
keep your encryption key secure from attackers willing to spend less
than US$1B to crack them.  Just choose the passphrase with strong
randomness, salt it, then spend a minute stretching the passphrase
with scrypt.  Memorizing such a passphrase with an optimal practice
schedule takes several minutes, but only once in your life.</p>
<p>For this to work, you absolutely cannot make up the passphrase
yourself with your mind.  You have to use a truly random physical
process such as rolling dice.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>xkcd clearly showed that for online password attacks, a password like
"<a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">correct horse battery staple</a>" is perfectly adequate — that is, a
password consisting of a small number of randomly chosen common words,
with spaces between them, and no unusual orthography — while more
common methods of choosing passwords are less secure; and furthermore
that these passwords are easier to remember.  But a footnote on the
comic explained that this may not be adequate for resisting offline
attacks.</p>
<p>(To those who wonder whether they should be taking security advice
from a comic strip: ① the argument and calculations in the strip are
correct, and ② you clearly don’t read xkcd.  Also, in that case, you
probably need to be told not to make up the passphrase with your mind;
use <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">Diceware</a> or something similarly strong.  Also you probably
need someone else to write the software to implement this for you.)</p>
<p>In a chat with a friend of mine yesterday, I realized, much to my
surprise, that this kind of password is also adequate against
<em>offline</em> attacks, like those that someone can try against encrypted
text they captured or against private keys, given certain conditions.</p>
<p>The approach is this.  You take a randomly chosen passphrase, run it
through a password-based key derivation function on a computer you
trust for a reasonable amount of time, and use the resulting output as
the encryption key.</p>
<p>("Brain wallet" is a broken implementation of this idea as it applies
to Bitcoin.  Most brainwallet-stored Bitcoins have been stolen.)</p>
<h2>How much entropy do we need?</h2>
<p>Let’s suppose we want the key to be secure against a billion dollars’
worth of attacker resources.  A million is probably okay for most
people in most situations, but a billion gives us some margin of
safety.  I calculated some <a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2010-October/000928.html">computing costs in 2010</a>; in particular,
running a regular personal computer cost about US$0.005 per minute,
which I’m going to figure is probably still about right.</p>
<p>The most advanced current password-based key derivation functions,
like Colin Percival’s 2009 <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html">scrypt</a>, minimize the cost advantage of
special-purpose attack hardware relative to a regular personal
computer; let’s figure that they keep it down to 8×, that is, that you
can duplicate a minute’s worth of scrypt computation for ⅛ of US$0.005
if you’re using special-purpose hardware.  (I think that by using a
custom packet-switched memory fabric like the Tera MTA, you can
probably beat that advantage by an order or two of magnitude, but
probably only the NSA has done this so far.)</p>
<p>So let’s suppose that you, the legitimate user, are willing to wait
for one minute, with one computer, to hash your password.  That is,
you’re spending ½¢, but you want your attacker to have to spend US$1B.
This means you need to choose one of about 400 billion passwords,
i.e. you need 39 bits of entropy.  Plus three bits for the custom
hardware advantage, for 42 bits.</p>
<p>"Correct horse battery staple" passwords can easily have 44 or 48 bits
of entropy, using only four words.</p>
<p>In effect, key stretching is adding 30–50 bits of difficulty to
breaking your key.</p>
<h2>Memorization schedule</h2>
<p>For a password like this that you never write down, even if it’s as
memorable as "correct horse battery staple", you need to establish a
practice schedule so that you don’t forget it, and it would be very
helpful to have <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition">spaced practice</a> software for this.  Existing
spaced practice software for memorization (things like AnyMemo, Anki,
or Mnemosyne) is not suitable unless you’re already using it.  It’s
designed for memorizing a large set of facts, not a single one, so it
only quizzes you when you ask it to run.</p>
<p>By contrast, in this case, you need to space your practice of just one
password.  I don’t know of any software for this.  When I did this
with a seven-word passphrase, I set an alarm on my phone repeatedly
for the repetitions in the first day, and thereafter repeated the
exercise each day for a long period of time by just using the password
each day:</p>
<ul>
<li>10:31: generated password; repeated it until I could remember it for
  a few minutes.</li>
<li>10:35: first practice.</li>
<li>10:37: second practice.</li>
<li>10:47: third practice.</li>
<li>11:30: fourth practice.</li>
<li>around 16:00: fifth practice.</li>
<li>That night: sixth practice.</li>
<li>The next morning: seventh practice.</li>
<li>Two days later: eighth practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The intervals here are a bit more conservative than the usual 1, 5,
25, 125, 625, 3125 intervals for practice memorization, for two
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The passphrase, although I impose linguistic associations onto it,
  doesn’t really have an underlying structure that simplifies it; so
  it’s inherently a hard thing to memorize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If at some point I forget the passphrase, I don’t have the
  opportunity to recover it from some reminder medium, as is usually
  the case for things I’m trying to memorize.  I can’t just turn over
  a flash card.  If I forget it once, and it’s not still in my
  terminal scrollback, it’s gone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the fourth try, I misremembered the passphrase at first, suggesting
that the schedule may not be conservative <em>enough</em>.  The exponential
factor in that case was about 3½, so you probably want something more
like a factor of 2½ to be safe: after repeating the password for 2
minutes, wait 3 minutes, 7 minutes, 20 minutes, an hour, 2 hours, 5
hours, 12 hours, a day, 2 days, 5 days.</p>
<p>(This probably means you want to start this process in the morning,
not at night.)</p>
<h2>Checksums</h2>
<p>If you’re going to wait for an entire minute to hash your password,
it’s kind of a bummer if it turns out you mistyped it.  This is
avoidable at the cost of slightly longer passwords.  If the password
is generated in a way that ensures that, say, the checksum of its
4-bit nibbles will be 0, then you have decreased the strength of the
password by 4 bits, while ensuring that 94% of the time that you type
the wrong password, the system can detect it immediately.</p>
<p>If the key-stretching program also knows the wordlist from which your
words were originally chosen, it can probably also catch most
typographical errors.</p>
<p>This is actually crucial for memorization; because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_law">hyperbolic
discounting</a>, when you’re practicing your password, you need
immediate feedback if you get it wrong.  (Hyperbolic discounting is
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/8om/does_hyperbolic_discounting_really_exist/">somewhat questionable</a> when applied to people making choices
consciously, but firmly established in operant conditioning, which is
what we’re dealing with here.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could simply use a longer password and less key
stretching, so that the key stretching process ends in around a
second.</p>
<h2>Moore’s Law</h2>
<p>A billion dollars of computing effort today is half a billion dollars
in a year and a half, if Moore’s Law continues.  In 15 years (in
2029), it will diminish to only a million dollars.  It's uncertain as
to whether this trend will continue.  It might even speed up: solar
photovoltaic energy will probably overtake fossil-fuel energy as a
fraction of our marketed energy in the early 2020s, and subsequently
energy will become cheaper even faster than computing hardware.</p>
<p>Each extra bit of password strength gives you about a year and a half
of Moore's Law lead time.</p>
<p>In cases like public keys used to authenticate forward-secret key
exchanges or authorize transactions, being secure against future
attacks is irrelevant.  In cases like the encryption used for your
disk, it is not.  You should probably assume that breaking your disk
encryption will become practical at some point, but you can probably
delay that day by using longer passwords.</p>
<p>Believe MC Frontalot: you can't hide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA6kG-tOkBs">secrets from the future</a>.</p>
<h2>Quantum computers</h2>
<p>Speaking of defending against future attacks, what about quantum
computers?</p>
<p>Grover's algorithm on quantum computers, if and when those turn out to
be feasible to build, halves your effective key length.  If applied to
your 48-bit pre-key-stretching password, this would reduce its
strength by 24 bits, which would make it feasible to break.  You could
use a 96-bit pre-key-stretching password (eight words) to resist this
attack.</p>
<p>I'm pretty ignorant about quantum computation, so I don't really know,
but I don't think you can apply Grover's or any other known quantum
algorithm to reduce the effective length of your stretched key — the
log of the number of possible passwords plus the log of the number of
operations used in stretching — by half.  If you could, then if your
key stretching involves a trillion operations (about 2⁴⁰) and you want
to resist a 2⁸⁰ attack, you need an effective key length of 160 bits,
of which 120 will have to come from the password: ten words.</p>
<h2>Massive attacks and salt</h2>
<p>An attacker can gain some advantage over the defender by attacking
many passwords in parallel.  With the approach described so far, if
there are, for example, 256 law enforcement officers who receive an
encrypted email, and the mafia successfully steals all of their
computers, the mafia doesn't need to spend a billion dollars to
decrypt one of the officers' disks.  Instead, they can spend 1/256 of
that to decrypt <em>any</em> of the officers' disks: they try each generated
key against all 256 disks.  This way they can get the email after only
a few million dollars' worth of work.</p>
<p>(Better, if someone does the billion dollars' worth of work just once,
they can make a rainbow table of all possible keys, although with such
a slow key derivation function, the rainbow table chain lengths will
be limited.  For example, with a chain length of 256, you'll need 2⁴⁰
entries for 2⁴⁸ possible passwords, occupying a total of 6 tebibytes;
but doing a single lookup in the table will take 2 hours.)</p>
<p>The standard approach to solving this problem is to salt the
passwords: store a nonsecret random string that gets combined with the
password (for example, concatenated with it) before you run the key
derivation function.  Many pieces of software will do this salting for
you, but if not, you can do it yourself.  For example, for a disk
encryption password, you can engrave the salt into the case of your
computer, next to the keyboard.  For example, your 48-bit salt might
be encoded as "sting vowed woken hold" while your password is "crowd
lasts men woody"; you type "sting vowed woken hold crowd lasts men
woody", having copied the first four words from the engraving.</p>
<p>Being interactively prompted with the salt would probably reduce the
incidence of accidentally typing the wrong password, a phenomenon
which compromises that password.</p>
<h2><em>Sequential</em> memory-hard algorithms are a wrong turn in this context</h2>
<p>The scrypt paper argues that sequential memory-hard algorithms give
defenders an extra advantage over attackers: by increasing the amount
of time needed by a defender to hash their correct password by some
factor N, you increase the cost to an attacker by N², because the
attacker needs both N times more memory and to use it for N times as
long.</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<h2>Timing and other side-channel attacks</h2>
<p>Memory-hard functions like scrypt, while necessary to resist custom
hardware, probably cannot execute in constant-time on off-the-shelf
hardware, because they need to generate and access large tables.  But
because the total time for the computation is so long, and because it
can't be automatically initiated by an attacker request and remote
attackers can't normally observe either the beginning or the end of
the process, timing attacks should in general be very difficult to
carry out.</p>
<p>Using phrases of English words rather than arbitrary characters adds a
great deal of redundancy to the password, which means that even very
minor amounts of side-channel leakage (such as keystroke timings,
audio of keystrokes, or RF emissions from the keyboard) should make it
possible to completely reconstruct the password.</p>
<p>I have no idea about power analysis.</p>
<h2>My preferred wordlist</h2>
<p>The S/KEY wordlist from <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1760.html">RFC1760</a> is commonly used; it consists of
2048 words of up to four letters.  It has a couple of flaws: it’s only
2048 words (11 bits per word), when 4096 is easily achievable; it
includes many very uncommon words, such as "Egan", "Eben", and "fogy",
impeding memorization; and it contains many words that are too
similar, such as "good", "gold", "goad", "goal", "coal", "foal", and
"goat".  For example, the 48-bit number 155759005738413 is encoded
using S/KEY as "aid shin mini ruse made", except in all capitals.  My
preferred wordlist, instead, encodes it as "hay fork catch diary",
which I think is dramatically more memorable.</p>
<p>Here are ten more S/KEY encodings of 48 bits, but in lowercase:</p>
<pre><code>air limb dash mask laws
ace cock rip fond bask
an shy lind juno folk
all doug jolt lang sob
aim tank bed neil juno
an fawn wean aqua if
ada ding sea hive kit
ada lies nip aids howl
ada cut love will hum
am iris gut din bold
</code></pre>
<p>Here are ten encodings of 48 bits with my wordlist:</p>
<pre><code>ici shrug slow solid
must fever plug hotel
facts foam gall frail
snake erika star i
belle feat dip waste
rent herr freud tuna
annie spade downs doo
grief sense infer cab
cuba g maths pig
days dusty small yacht
</code></pre>
<p>I generate these with <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/netbook-misc-devel/bitwords.py">bitwords.py</a>, which uses the system
truly-random-number generator, which is almost as trustworthy as
rolling dice if you’re on a Linux machine that isn’t backdoored.</p>
<p>I derived the following wordlist by taking the most common 4096 words
of 5 letters or less from the British National Corpus.  It’s
imperfect, as you can see above; it still includes some nonwords,
uncommon proper nouns, and words very similar to one another.  In
practice, though, as you can see from the above, the words it
generates are pretty memorable.  Many of them are sentences or noun
phrases, or almost: "Rent Herr Freud tuna!  Must fever plug hotel?
Grief sense infer[s] cab.  Cuba G: Maths pig!  Day's dusty small
yacht.  Annie spade-downs doo."</p>
<p>It also has the problem, shared with the S/KEY list, that it contains
many words that are too similar to one another: it contains not only
"sold", but also "old", "told", "hold", "cold", "gold", "bold",
"solid", "sole", and "solo".  This means that a typo or misremembering
of a password is often also a valid password.</p>
<p>Previously I used the most common 4096 words in English (again,
according to the British National Corpus) but it turns out that they
are only slightly more memorable than these words, and substantially
shorter.  These are drawn from the most common 15898 words, adding
perhaps 15% to the difficulty of memorization (log 15898/log 4096);
they average 4.25 letters, while the most common 4096 average 6.57
letters, adding 55% to the time needed to type them.  This tradeoff
seems reasonable.</p>
