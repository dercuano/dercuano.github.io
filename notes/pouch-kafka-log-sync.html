(5 minutes)</div><p>Suppose you want to build an offline-first browser app.  A simple way
to structure this is using a Kafka-like approach: all of the data in
the app is stored in some set of append-only logs (or “feeds”, as
Secure Scuttlebutt calls them, or “topics”, as Kafka calls them), each
corresponding to a single writer (or “producer”, as Kafka calls them,
or “identity”, as SSB calls them; for example, a particular profile in
a particular browser on a particular user account on a particular
computer).  Synchronization of these logs is very simple, as long as
there are never conflicting writes: for nodes A and B to synchronize
log L, one tells the other the last entry they have in log L, and the
other responds either by requesting the entries they don’t have or by
sending the other entries:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;A&gt; my last entry in log L is 3258
&lt;B&gt; please send entries in L from 3201 to 3258
&lt;A&gt; entry 3201 in L is “joajgoiagjaesog”
&lt;A&gt; entry 3202 in L is “jogwj03280t02380”
...
&lt;A&gt; entry 3258 in L is “320820231di0w02”
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>&lt;A&gt; my last entry in log L is 3258
&lt;B&gt; entry 3259 in L is “302808gwahjg0saigj”
&lt;B&gt; entry 3260 in L is “]0ga0gjewagj0iew”
</code></pre>
<p>As long as there are never two machines creating conflicting entries
in L, this protocol is simple, correct, and eventually consistent,
regardless of the topology.  SSB ensures this by requiring a
public-key signature on each entry (“message”) to prevent the
propagation of unauthorized messages, and a previous-entry hash in
each entry to prevent the log owner from propagating modifications to
previously published messages, although they can still provoke
desynchronization.</p>
<p>Nodes A and B might be a server and a browser, a browser and a server,
or two browsers.  As long as they are careful never to share
information with anyone who isn’t authorized to have it (SSB
implements this by encrypting anything nonpublic, so that untrusted
nodes can safely forward any message) it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>By itself, this provides, essentially, a group chat application.  But
an append-only data store can be used for any application.</p>
<p>For example, you could implement a centralized key-value store in a
single log by appending (key, state, value) entries to it, where
“state” is either “existing” or “deleted”.  The current state and
value for a given key is just the most recent one in the log.  This
allows read-only slaves, and if you are sufficiently confident in your
failover mechanisms, it could even allow for recovery after the loss
of the master node.</p>
<p>If you want to allow multiple writers, though, you can achieve this
with multiple logs, but you probably want to be able to at least
detect lost-update conflicts; this requires expanding the entry tuple
to ((key, parent), state, value), where “parent” is some
ABA-problem-proof identifier of the previous state of the key, such as
a secure hash of the entry that state was set in.  If there are ever
two entries with the same (key, parent), those entries are in
conflict; the conflict must be resolved, through some application-
specific mechanism.  (In Git, this is done with a commit that has two
parents; in Bitcoin, you instead use the block with the longest chain
length from the root.  The Git mechanism has the advantage that it
records explicitly that the conflict has been resolved rather than
forgotten.)</p>
<p>You could imagine a more sophisticated conflict-detection mechanism;
for example, to commit a transaction, you could write some (key,
transactionid, state, value) entries for the values modified, some
(transactionid, entryid) entries for the entries that were read during
the transaction, and finally a (“commit”, transactionid) or
(“rollback”, transactionid) entry.  Two or more committed transactions
conflict if there does not exist an ordering in which none of them
read versions of data that had been overwritten by a previous
transaction.</p>
<p>A convenient way of structuring a key-value store program that uses
this data store is to have it iterate over the entire history at
startup time, constructing, say, an in-memory hash table of the latest
value associated with each key — essentially replaying the history of
the database.  To reduce startup time, it could checkpoint a snapshot
of the hash table along with the current entry numbers in each log;
then, upon restart, it need only replay the entries since those
offsets (as Kafka calls them).  Indeed, it could store these snapshots
in its own private log.</p>
<p>For some applications, it’s reasonable to store the entire history of
the application, either because the total volume of data is relatively
small, or because the total amount of relevant data grows almost as
fast as the entire history does.  In other applications, it is
necessary to forget old data because it takes up too much space.
Kafka’s approach is to, usually, store only the most recent data.
This is probably the only approach compatible with the simple
synchronization algorithm given above.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
