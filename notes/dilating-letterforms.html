(15 minutes)</div><p>So I was thinking about how to dilate and erode letterforms, in order
to generate a range of fonts from some scanned hand-drawn characters.
This has a couple of applications.  First, hand-drawn characters may
be fairly nonuniform in line thickness, and you may want to make the
line thickness more consistent; some kind of nonlinear erosion to a
skeleton, followed by dilation, can give you uniform line thickness.
Second, scanned data may have flecks, and various compositions of
dilation and erosion are well known to eliminate flecks below a
critical dimension.  Third, you may want to apply calligraphic effects
to letters, such as changing the pen angle or nib width, or providing
a nib width to pencil-drawn characters.</p>
<h2>Thresholded-blur-based dilation and erosion</h2>
<p>One of the algorithms that occurred to me was to blur the characters
and then threshold the blurred characters, perhaps at a much higher
resolution than they were scanned at, converting each original pixel
to a discrete impulse in the center of a much larger empty space
before blurring.  This, in a sense, provides a vectorization mechanism
for a bilevel image; you can blur and threshold the characters at an
arbitrarily high resolution, and thanks to Nyquist’s sampling theorem
and the convolution theorem, you’ll always get the same results as
long as your blur is the sampled approximation of whatever true
analytic blur you’re blurring with, and as long as it doesn’t have any
significant frequency components above the Nyquist frequency, whether
that’s a Gaussian, a sinc, or something else.</p>
<p>However, this contains a pitfall.  What happens if we look at the
contours of a blurred set of impulses like this?  If we fill in the
empty area with zeroes, as the theory says we should, then we’ll find
that the positive contours around positive impulses are convex, as are
the negative contours around negative impulses, but as we cross zero
going away from a positive impulse toward an adjacent negative
impulse, we find our contours becoming concave.  If we have a
checkerboard of ±1 impulses, for example, and a circularly symmetric
blur kernel, then the positive contours will be near-circles around
the +1 impulses, while the negative contours will be near-circles
around the -1 impulses.  Only at 0 do we find the contours running in
straight lines, dividing the checkerboard into positive and negative
squares.</p>
<p>So I propose that what we should do is that, before upsampling, we
should add or subtract a constant to the impulses so that our desired
threshold will be, in the transformed value space, 0.</p>
<p>If the blur kernel has limited support, the contours in each cell or
“tile” of the grid will depend only on some limited neighborhood of
impulses, and of course the threshold.  If the support is one pixel or
less (of the original image), it will depend only on the four
neighboring pixels, like Perlin noise.  Like Wang tiles, the tile is
guaranteed to match its neighboring tiles by virtue of shared edge
colors (corner-pair colors, in this case).  Even if the kernel support
takes into account a 4×4 area, for bilevel input images, it’s feasible
to precompute all the possible tiles.  Cubic spline kernels will have
continuous second derivatives, which means their contours will also
have continuously changing curvature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s possible to compute points on the contours directly,
without resorting to actually computing the pixels of a
high-resolution upsampled image.  If the blur kernel is polynomial or
piecewise polynomial by tiles, then the blurred image within a given
tile is a single polynomial function — bicubic in the case of splines
over 4×4 neighborhoods, and in any case a linear combination of parts
of the blur kernel.</p>
<p>This generalized erosion or dilation operation should be more capable
of preserving smooth curves than the standard iterated morphological
operations, but it might also lead to ink blotting at line joins.</p>
<p>I thought that by using an asymmetric blur kernel, it should be
possible to convert strokes of uniform weight into strokes of varying
width according to their angle, but I’m not sure that’s actually true.
It’s depending on the final thresholding operator to introduce the
nonlinearity where, say, vertical strokes convert into more ink than
horizontal strokes.  And I’m not sure simple thresholding is up to the
job.</p>
<h2>Erosion to skeletons</h2>
<p>Erosion-to-skeletons is a nonstandard morphological operation.
Standard erosion can be done on a 3×3 pixel window; if any input pixel
in the window is empty, the resulting output pixel in the center of
the window is empty.  But this can erase lines or dots completely, and
indeed such despeckling is one of the uses for standard erosion.</p>
<p>Suppose that instead we use a 4×4 pixel window.  Now we can see
whether the pixel we’re about to erase is part of a line or speck
that’s already been reduced to a thickness of 2 or 1.  In that case,
we can preserve a thickness-1 line, although if we’re reducing
thickness 2 to thickness 1, we have to choose a bias direction in
which to move the line: left, right, up, or down.  My hope is that we
can neutralize this bias by running successive passes of the algorithm
with biases that cancel out, for example using the Thue-Morse
sequence to alternate directions.</p>
<h2>Pipelined morphological operations</h2>
<p>In the 1970s and early 1980s, the ERIM Cytocomputer, a special-purpose
parallel architecture, had the fastest implementation of the Game of
Life, although it was primarily used for machine vision applications.
Rather than dedicating one processor to each board region, it
dedicated one processor to each time step, pipelining cells from one
processor to the next.  In this fashion, a Cytocomputer with a
16-stage pipeline (I don’t remember if this was a normal size) could
output one Life cell every clock cycle, 16 generations later than the
generation that had been fed into the pipeline, with slightly over 16
rows of latency.  I don’t remember what the clock speed was, either,
but I think it was a few megahertz.</p>
<p>You might think this would require a massive memory for each
processor, but in fact each one only needs a couple of
reasonable-sized FIFOs.  To compute the cell marked O, it needs to
consider the previous-generation states of the cells marked X and the
cell marked O, and needs to retain the previous-generation states of
the cells marked .:</p>
<pre><code>                   XXX........................................
...................XOX........................................
...................XXX
</code></pre>
<p>In a pipeline, each pipeline stage is computing one scan line plus two
pixels behind the previous one; note that most of the pixels are
duplicated in two different FIFOs:</p>
<pre><code>                   XXX........................................
...................XOXXX......................................
...................XXXOXXX....................................
.....................XXXOXXX..................................
.......................XXXOX..................................
.........................XXX
</code></pre>
<p>The pixels were 8-bit bytes, the FIFO size was either fixed or capped
at 1024 or 2048 or 4096 or something, and in addition to the Life
rule, the Cytocomputer was capable of a variety of
machine-vision-relevant operations such as thresholding,
edge-detection (I don’t remember, probably at least Canny), dilation,
and erosion, which like the Game of Life can all be computed as a
finite function on a 3×3 neighborhood, and of course in these
applications, each stage of the pipeline could be programmed to
perform a different function.  You programmed it with a bletcherous
scripting language on an attached general-purpose computer.</p>
<p>I think you can do something similar with SSE on a modern CPU, but
perhaps many pixels per cycle instead of one, and maybe only one
pipeline stage per instruction.  The idea, though, is to stream pixel
data into the L1 cache (from another cache or from main memory), apply
a whole generic pipeline of such local operations to it, and then
stream it back out of L1 cache with the whole set of operations
applied.</p>
<h3>Digression: tiling</h3>
<p>Usually for this kind of processing you want to tile the pixel data to
reduce the size of the necessary FIFOs, although that makes the
indexing somewhat more complicated.  “Tiling” means that you turn the
usual two dimensions of image data into four dimensions: an X and Y to
locate the tile, and an x and y to locate the pixel within the tile.
For example, with 8×8 tiles, the pixels in a 16×16 image might be in
this order instead of the usual one:</p>
<pre><code>  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71

<p>(This kind of tiling also made it possible to interact with
many-megapixel images in real time on 1980s graphics workstations.
Perhaps your LANDSAT scene was 50 megapixels and your machine only had
8MiB of RAM.  Without tiling, in the format the LANDSAT people would
deliver you the images, the megapixel you could fit on the monitor was
1000 fragments splattered across 7 megapixels on disk, which was 21
megabytes in RGB or 43 megabytes in its full multispectral glory, and
if you want to pan 100 pixels to the right, those pixels are
splattered across those same 21 megabytes; so even a slight panning
would induce a multi-second disk wait.  With 16×16 tiling, your screen
would instead contain parts of some 60–70 rows of tiles, which could
be accessed in 60–70 seeks: about a second.  JPEG image compression
was not yet a thing, and even today its use for remote-sensing imagery
is dubious.)</p>
<p>8×8 tiles are a typical size, but I suspect that 32×32 tiles (or even
bigger, 64×64 or 128×128) might make more sense for most purposes on
modern hardware.</p>
<p>(End of digression.)</p>
<h3>Bitwise morphological operations</h3>
<p>For morphological operations, we might really benefit from
bit-packing, where we can get 128 pixels into an SSE register (or 256
pixels into an AVX register).  Then, the erosion or dilation operation
(depending on interpretation) is mostly <code>a | a &lt;&lt; 1 | a &gt;&gt; 1 | b | b
&lt;&lt; 1 | b &gt;&gt; 1 | c | c &lt;&lt; 1 | c &gt;&gt; 1</code>, but that only produces 126
correct bits of new state for b; the first and last bits are
incorrect.</p>
<p>Note that this is a separable operation: we can do it first
horizontally and then vertically.  So we could, for example, compute
<code>a | a &lt;&lt; 1 | a &gt;&gt; 1</code> — plus the correction for the first and last
bits — once, and use it to compute results on all three scan lines.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
