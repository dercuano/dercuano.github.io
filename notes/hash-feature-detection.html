(5 minutes)</div><p>Thinking about image registration and feature extraction, I thought:
what about hashing?</p>
<p>In particular, think about a record player playing a scratched-up
record, full of random crackles and pops, each due to a pit in the
record surface left by the needle being shoved into it by long-ago
dust.  If you’re looking for a particular location on the record, you
can cross-correlate the audio stream with the specific sequence of
crackles and pops at that location, and you are nearly sure to have a
sharp peak at exactly the right point.  This, in theory, allows you to
determine the position of the turntable disc at that moment to within
a fraction of a micron.</p>
<p>This won't work in its simple form if the playback speed is a little
bit off — the distance between the pops in the pattern you’re looking
for will be off by more than the width of a pop, and so the
correlation won't have a clear peak.  But this can be remedied
inexpensively, and save you the expense of running the full
cross-correlation to boot.</p>
<p>Suppose our sample pattern is one second of audio.  Take the
strongest, say, five pops in that second.  Typically, they'll be a
decibel or so louder than the sixth-loudest pop, which is a decibel or
so louder than the seventh-loudest, and so on.  Now, take the last 1.5
seconds of audio and find the loudest eight pops in it, and try
matching all 56 three-pop subsequences of those eight against all 10
three-pop subsequences of those five you’re looking for, 560
comparisons in all.  The candidate pops might not be in exactly the
same order of loudness, because some of them might be very similar to
the same level, and there is noise in the playback, but because the
pops are so much louder than the rest of the recording, it’s almost
certain that there will be a match.  And because you’re matching a
three-pop sequence, you have a ratio of intervals that have to match
pretty closely between the pattern and the signal, according to some
kind of time stretch.  And that gives you a probably-unique candidate
alignment on which to try the whole correlation.</p>
<p>You can adjust the values of 8, 5, 3, and 1.5, of course.  Increasing
8 and 5 will increase the number of candidate alignments to try, thus
increasing the chances of finding the correct alignment; increasing
the value of 3 will increase the number at first and then decrease it.
Increasing 1.5 will increase the amount of scale variation that can be
tolerated, but at the risk of missing a match unless you increase
8, 5, 3, or all three.</p>
<p>(Of course, you can do much better if you have a pretty good idea
where you are in the record groove to start with, because then you
just need to adjust your estimate of the velocity up or down a bit as
each pop or crackle goes by.)</p>
<p>In a sense, image feature detection algorithms are an attempt to
superimpose crackles and pops onto images in such a way that their
position, relative to the underlying image, remains precise in the
face of a panoply of insults: from noise to 2-D rotation to scaling to
3-D rotation obscuring part of an object.</p>
<p>But in some sense, at least in the one-dimensional world where we
don't need to worry about rotations in two or three dimensions, it
seems like it should be trivial to develop a robust feature-detection
algorithm.  Nearly any function should work as long as it’s local, not
totally disrupted by noise, and positions itself relatively precisely.
For example, if we apply a couple of noise-reduction filters (maybe a
median filter, if speckle noise is not actually signal as in the above
example, and a Gaussian convolution) the last few peaks or
zero-crossings should often be pretty stable; perhaps we can hash the
distances between them, or the ratios of distances between them,
perhaps quantized a bit.  Then we can apply a filter to this stream of
hash values: for example, ignore the hash unless its last 10 bits are
zeroes.  This should make our “pops” sufficiently sparse to be useful.</p>
<p>If we're trying to apply such an approach to images, it might be
useful to do it by tracing paths in the image, using some kind of
convergent approach, like maybe ascending the gradient of the absolute
value of the gradient, thus seeking to walk along edges.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
