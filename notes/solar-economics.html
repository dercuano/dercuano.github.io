<p>Item #1 on the National Academy of Engineering's <a href="http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/cms/challenges.aspx">list of the most
important engineering
challenges</a>
of this century:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Make solar energy economical.  Solar energy provides less than
  1% of the world's total energy, but it has the potential to
  provide much, much more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Calculations of Limits</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/cms/8996/9082.aspx">detail
page</a> claims
that the blurb is wrong; only 0.001% of the world's total energy usage
is sold in the market, of which a fraction is fossil fuel.
Additionally, although it's not mentioned in the page, many of the
world's poorest people live entirely off of solar energy.  It's just
that the other 99.999% of the energy isn't easily used to drive
mechanical engines at the moment.</p>
<p>Some of it is captured by plants in sugars and cellulose through
photosynthesis, and that is called the planet's "net primary
production".  Peter Vitousek and others estimated in 1986 ("<a href="http://dieoff.org/page83.htm" title="by Peter Vitousek, Paul R. Ehrlich, Anne H. Ehrlich, and Pamela Matson">Human
Appropriation of the Products of Photosynthesis</a>") that humans
consume as food or firewood 3% of its net primary production
(including food for livestock) totaling 7.2 Pg/year of dry biomass,
and "co-opt" another 19%, out of a total of 132.1 Pg/year.</p>
<p>7.2 Pg of carbohydrates is about 1.5 * 10^20 joules.  132.1 Pg of
carbohydrates is about 27.7 * 10^20 joules.  The US DoE EIA
<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/">International Energy Outlook 2007</a>
(<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/pdf/0484(2007).pdf">PDF</a>) reports
that "world marketed energy consumption" was 447 quadrillion Btu in
2004, which is about
4.7 * 10^20 joules.  This figure doesn't appear to include food
sales.</p>
<p>A crude calculation (earthradius_equatorial^2 * pi * (1000 W/m^2) *
1 year in <code>units(1)</code> --- gosh, Unix is great!) suggests that the
total solar energy falling on the earth is about 40000 * 10^20
joules per year.  If Vitousek's figures are right, that means that
the earth's ecosystem is about 0.07% efficient at converting
sunlight into biomass, and therefore probably not more than 1.5%
efficient at converting sunlight into anything but heat.</p>
<p>This leads to the conclusion that "world marketed energy
consumption" is about 17% of the planet's net primary production,
assuming that figure hasn't changed much since 1979, but that the
planet's net primary production is only 0.007% of the energy
received from the sun by the Earth.  17% of 0.007% is indeed about
0.001%, the figure from the original blurb.</p>
<p>At some point we'll have self-reproducing hardware, and the cost of
manufacturing the solar cells will cease to be a problem; it will
simply be a question of land use.  To supply the 4.7 * 10^20 joules
per year being currently sold in the market with the 40%-efficient
solar cells in some labs today, we'd need to capture 11.75 * 10^20
joules per year of sunlight, which is 0.03% of the surface of the
earth, including oceans.  <a href="http://www.ez2c.de/ml/solar_land_area/">Matthias Loster made a lovely visualization
of this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Solar_land_area.png">put it on
Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>If you were using 4%-efficient solar cells instead, you'd need 0.3% of
the earth's surface area.  <a href="XXX">Off-the-shelf inexpensive thin-film solar
panels are about 8% XXX efficient</a>.</p>
<h2>Calculations of Growth Rates</h2>
<p>In 2005, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory published <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy05osti/37322.pdf">a FAQ on
energy payback times of photovoltaic
cells</a>, which explained
that at the time, multicrystalline photovoltaic cells produced more
energy than had been used to make them in 2-4 years.  Here are their
references; I haven't read any of them:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The payback time is a representation of a sort of compound interest
rate; a payback time of 2 years is a 50% annual percentage growth, 4
years is 25%.  If you spend the produced energy on making new solar
cells, those are the actual growth rates of your stock of solar cells
(plus a bonus, in the form of compounding the interest more
frequently, if you get the new cells into production in less than a
year).</p>
<p>So consider <a href="http://edgar.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/947397/000095013508001256/b68105ese10vk.htm">Evergreen Solar's current
situation</a>.
They're a small company with a market capitalization of US$917M as of
their last annual report.  Their current manufacturing capacity is 15
megawatts per year, and they've contracted to manufacture 125
megawatts in 2009, 300 megawatts in 2010, 600 megawatts in 2011, and
850 megawatts in 2012.  Suppose a company of similar size were to
invest its 300-megawatt 2010 production merely in making more solar
cells, and that it had no non-energy costs.  An annual growth rate of
50% --- that is, a 2-year payback --- would look like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The current 4.7 * 10^20 joules/year being sold in the market is 
14 893 719 megawatts, which this curve crosses around 2037, and with
the usual 5:1 ratio between peak watts and achieved watts (due to
nighttime, solar angle changes, clouds, etc.) you don't reach it until
2041 or 2042.  If you start with the 1744 megawatts that Evergreen
says Solarbuzz said constituted the global solar power market in 2006,
you gain about 8 years.</p>
<p>However, the <em>financial</em> payback time on solar panels is still
dramatically longer, which is why they still haven't reached "grid
parity" --- costing less per watt-hour than power from the grid.
Solar panels <a href="http://www.wholesalesolar.com/solar-panels.html">still cost US$4-$5 per peak
watt</a> at retail.
That's about US$20 per average watt, which is 8760 watt-hours per
year; that's about US$0.87 of electricity at grid rates.  That's a
23-year <em>financial</em> payback, and that doesn't include things like
batteries, inverters, wiring, and installation.</p>
<h2>Evergreen Solar</h2>
<p>Evergreen's annual report suggests some reasons for this: the market
is expanding at 42% per year, their own production capacity has to
expand by a factor of more than 50 from 2007 to 2012 (this from a
company that's already 13 years old).  They had 276 full-time
employees in manufacturing to reach their 15-megawatt-per-year
capacity: 18 employee-years per megawatt.  Their new
80-megawatt-per-year facility is expected to require another 410
employees (5 employee-years per megawatt).  They are struggling to
increase manufacturing capacity fast enough to keep up with demand,
and apparently so are their "polysilicon" suppliers, because there's
an industrywide shortage of polysilicon; building new polysilicon
manufacturing facilities takes several years.</p>
<p>(I'm a little bit dubious about their terminology; I think the
company's management may just not be very technical, or maybe not very
smart.  "Polysilicon" is short for "polycrystalline silicon", and
silicon becomes polysilicon at the point that you crystallize it in a
polycrystalline form in your furnaces.  So the suppliers are supplying
Evergreen with silicon; how many crystals are in each piece of silicon
they supply is somewhat immaterial, since Evergreen melts the silicon
down and crystallizes it in polycrystalline silicon ribbons in their
furnaces.)</p>
<p>They report that they had US$58M of product revenues in 2007, with
US$53M "cost of revenue", which presumably includes things like
manufacturing employee salaries, energy, and raw materials.  They
spent US$21M on research and development and another US$21M on
"Selling, general, and administrative", and US$1.4M on "facility
start-up", building a new plant to increase their manufacturing
capacity from 15MW to 95MW this year.</p>
<p>So suppose they manufactured 15MW in 2007, as their annual report
suggests.  That would mean they got paid US$3.87 per watt on average,
which is more or less in keeping with the US$4-$5 the panels cost at
retail.  They spent US$3.53 of that on their actual manufacturing
costs.  They explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of our Marlboro facility [where all of their
manufacturing currently takes place] is to develop and prototype new
manufacturing process technologies which, when developed, will be
employed in new factories. As such, our manufacturing costs incurred
in Marlboro are substantially burdened by additional engineering
costs and also reflect inefficiencies typically inherent in pilot
and development operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere they explain that they use about 5 grams of silicon per
watt; <a href="http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silicon/silicmcs06.pdf">metallurgical-grade silicon costs about US$0.77 per
pound</a>
, or US$0.0017/g.</p>
<p>They don't break out the costs of the silicon they buy from their
suppliers, which might cost considerably more than the
metallurgical-grade silicon it's made from.  It appears that they have
made prepayments and cash loans of, as I read it, about US$50M on a
set of multi-year silicon supply contracts, although they only list
US$23M in their "prepaid cost of inventory" line item; and elsewhere
they say, "we have silicon under contract to reach annual production
levels of approximately 125MW in 2009, 300MW in 2010, 600MW in 2011,
and 850MW in 2012", for a total of 1875MW; and they say, "We believe
future enhancements to our technology will enable us to gradually
reduce our silicon consumption [from 5g/W] to approximately
two-and-a-half grams per watt by 2012."</p>
<p>So suppose those 1875MW are to be made at an average of 3.5 g/W;
that's 6600 million grams of silicon.  And suppose the US$50M
represents about half of the total price of that silicon; that would
give us US$0.015 per gram of silicon.  That's more or less in line
with the raw silicon cost I estimated above for metallurgical-grade
silicon --- it's higher, and by a factor of only about 2 --- which
gives me some confidence that my guesstimate that the cost of the
silicon is not yet a significant factor in the cost of the solar
cells.</p>
<p>However, note that securing one of these long-term silicon supply
agreements required selling about 15% of the company to the silicon
supplier.  The restrictions on that stock "will lapse upon the
delivery of 500 metric tons of polysilicon to the Company", so we can
guess that the total contract with that supplier is in the
neighborhood of 1000-2000 million grams.</p>
<p>Also, they list $629M in "raw materials purchase commitments" among
their "contractual cash obligations".  This, plus the prepayments, is
perhaps a ceiling on the amount of payment they may have committed to
for the silicon; US$679M for 6600 million grams of silicon would be
US$0.10 per gram, which would raise the cost of silicon above from
US$0.008 per watt to US$0.35 per watt.  (It's possible that they have
other raw materials purchase commitments, say for silane or
hydrofluoric acid.)</p>
<p>In 2006, Evergreen and EverQ bought US$8M worth of silicon from REC,
who I think was their sole silicon supplier at the time (unless DC
Chemical was also a supplier?).  During that year, they had $102K of
sales.  In 2007, Evergreen bought US$3M worth from REC, which is
US$0.20 per watt if they produced 15MW.</p>
<p>Let's assume that their per-employee cost of labor on the factory
floor is about US$120 000 per year.  At 18 employee-years per
megawatt, that's about US$2.2M per megawatt, or about US$2.20 per
watt.</p>
<p>If we assume that the NREL numbers are applicable to their
manufacturing, then each peak watt of panels required about 4kWh of
energy; let's assume that costs US$0.10/kWh.  So, per watt, we have:</p>
<pre><code>revenue       US$3.87
gross profit  US$0.34
electricity   US$0.40
raw silicon   US$0.008

labor         US$2.20
OTHER         US$0.92
</code></pre>
<p>At present, they're also spending about half of their revenue on
research and development.  (That's part of why they're still losing
money.)  We can expect that the cost of labor per watt will decrease
substantially in their 80MW non-pilot facility: 5 employee-years per
megawatt would be US$0.60 per watt.</p>
<p>They also have been spending on the order of US$50M per year on
capital expenditures, mostly equipment and facilities improvements.
They report that their "fixed assets, net" are worth US$115M,
including US$53M of "laboratory and manufacturing equipment", US$14M
of "leasehold improvements", and US$67M of "assets under
construction".  They seem to expect that constructing the first 80MW/y
production line in their new facility will cost around US$100M,
although they don't really break it out that way in the report.
That's about US$1.25/watt/year.</p>
<p>A capital cost of US$1.25 per watt/year of manufacturing capacity does
not unavoidably contribute much to the cost per watt; after all, you
can in principle amortize it over an arbitrary number of years.
However, in an industry with a 42% annual growth rate, almost all
cells will necessarily have come out of factories built within the
last year or two, so it probably adds US$0.60/watt or more to the cost
of the cells.</p>
<p>EverQ, a separate company that Evergreen owns a third of, had
operating revenue of US$194M, cost of goods sold of US$160M, "other
expenses" of US$27M, and assets of US$556M.  I wish I had handy
EverQ's manufacturing capacity numbers.</p>
<h2>Nanosolar</h2>
<p>Nanosolar claims an energy payback time of one month and a per-watt
cost of 30 cents with their copper indium gallium diselenide thin-film
cells, in <a href="http://www.celsias.com/2007/11/23/nanosolars-breakthrough-technology-solar-now-cheaper-than-coal/">a November 2007 article on
Celsias</a>,
although they had expected a cost in the sixties of cents per watt in
<a href="http://earth2tech.com/2007/07/30/10-questions-for-nanosolar-ceo-martin-roscheisen/">a July 2007
interview</a>.
In the Celsias article, they also say they plan to reach 430 megawatts
of production per year in 2008.</p>
<p>In the interview, CEO Martin Roscheisen also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...it is clear we are going to be manufacturing capacity limited for
about as far out as we can see. There’s presently really only two
truly scalable solar markets in the world — Germany and Spain — and
we do a lot there. Being a scalable market is today as much about
feed-in-tariffs as about the administrative framework; tomorrow,
with grid-parity PV systems, it is primarily about the latter.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Material Shortages</h2>
<p>As I said before, Evergreen is experiencing an industrywide
polysilicon shortage; however, the raw material silicon is extremely
abundant, being the principal component of one of the most common
minerals in the terrestrial crust.</p>
<p>However, the materials used in copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS)
thin-film cells like Nanosolar's are somewhat less abundant.  Copper
has been a precious metal since the Bronze Age, but indium, gallium,
and selenium are all fairly rare.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, after years of rapid increase, silver prices
averaged US$13.40 per troy ounce in 2007, according to the <a href="http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silver/mcs-2008-silve.pdf">USGS's
silver
report</a>.
That's US$430 per kilogram.  About 20 700 tons of silver were mined in
2007.</p>
<p>Indium, by contrast, <a href="http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/indium/">cost US$795 per kg in
2007</a>, and
averaged an even higher US$918 per kg in 2006, and only 510 tons were
refined in 2007, making it 40 times rarer than silver and 85% more
expensive.  The USGS claims, "Thin-film ... CIGS solar cells require
approximately 50 metric tons of indium to produce 1 gigawatt of solar
power," which still makes it a tiny fraction of the total cost.  (I am
assuming the USGS is referring to peak watts at one sun, i.e. in
direct sunlight without lenses or mirrors, and not average output or
solar-concentrator output.)  That's US$0.04 of indium per watt, so the
price of indium would have to increase by a factor of 75 to increase
the cost of thin-film cells by US$3 per watt.  That would be about
US$60 000 per kg.  I think grid parity is somewhere around US$1 per
watt, which would be around US$20 000 per kg.</p>
<p>At higher prices, you would expect new low-concentration sources of
indium to become economic to refine, which would be nice, because
current world indium production is only enough for about 10 gigawatts
of CIGS per year.  It's difficult to predict what kinds of
improvements could occur and how much they could increase indium
production.  However, we can get a little bit of a clue by looking at
the last several years.  In 2002, indium cost only US$130 per
kilogram, so we've already experienced a dramatic price increase,
driven by dramatically increased production of LCD displays, which use
indium tin oxide for thin-film transparent electrodes.  So how much
did indium production increase when the price increased by a factor of
seven over four years?  It increased from 335 tons to 510 tons.  [XXX
check that. probably slightly wrong.]</p>
<p>So, although it's error-prone to predict, the evidence suggests that
indium production capacity will prove quite difficult to scale up over
the next several years, which could limit CIGS thin-film solar cells
to a small fraction of the overall energy market.</p>
<p>Gallium is only slightly more expensive than silver, at <a href="http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gallium/mcs-2008-galli.pdf">US$460 per
kg</a>.
Supplies of gallium are even more limited than those of indium; the
USGS report <em>estimates</em> world primary gallium production capacity at
184 metric tons per year, and actual production at 80 metric tons per
year, making it 250 times rarer than silver.  In the absence of the
LCD demand that has caused indium's price to skyrocket over the last
several years, its price has remained relatively constant 2002-2007
even as imports have more than doubled.  This would seem to suggest
that gallium's production could be increased considerably more easily
than indium, but I suspect that this is not the case, as I explain
below.</p>
<p>The gallium prices are stated for extremely pure gallium, with less
than 0.1ppm impurities, because this is what is needed for its
largest-volume use, high-performance integrated circuits made of
gallium arsenide, largely for RF components in cell phones.  The USGS
also reports some information on "low-grade" 99.99% pure gallium:</p>
<pre><code>Prices for low-grade (99.99%-pure) gallium increased in the first
half of 2007 from $300 to $350 per kilogram at the beginning of
the year to about $500 per kilogram by midyear. Producers in China
claimed that there was a shortage of supply, which was the
principal reason for the increase in prices. Some were offering
gallium at prices as high as $800 per kilogram, but little
business was completed at this price level.
</code></pre>
<p>The reason I think gallium production will hit limits similar to
indium production is that indium and gallium are chemically very
similar, and they are both primarily refined from trace amounts (50
ppm or more, at present) found in zinc ores and bauxite, and
consequently they are found as impurities in zinc.  So I think it is
unlikely that there are large amounts of easily recoverable gallium
hiding somewhere without corresponding amounts of indium accompanying
them.</p>
<p>Because of their chemical similarity, they are substitutable for one
another in some semiconductor applications.</p>
<p>I believe CIGS contains equal numbers of atoms of indium and gallium,
but I think the gallium is somewhat heavier.  XXX I need to look at a
fucking periodic table.</p>
<p>Selenium is also only found in trace amounts in the Earth's crust.  I
don't know how much it costs or how much is being mined.</p>
<p>Silicon solar cells are made from silicon, arsenic, boron XXX, and
aluminum --- some of the most common elements on Earth.  However,
their processing XXX</p>
<h2>Solar Concentrators</h2>
<p>Everything above --- costs per watt, factory production capacities in
watts, materials per watt, etc. --- is about solar cells in "one sun",
i.e. the intensity of sunlight that naturally reaches the surface of
the Earth, which is about 1000 W/m².  Silicon photovoltaic cells can
theoretically turn up to 31% of that into electricity, but the less
expensive polycrystalline cells in common use are only about 12%
efficient, with even lower efficiencies of 9-12% or so for thin-film
cells and 6% for amorphous silicon cells.  There are more expensive
"multijunction" non-silicon cells available for sale now that are 34%
efficient, and 41%-efficient cells in laboratories that will
presumably reach production soon; and there are quantum-dot and
photonic-crystal approaches that could reach 60% in theory.  (Some of
these numbers are from the NREL report cited earlier, while others are
from the National Academy of Engineering page cited earlier.)</p>
<p>However, these more-watts-per-unit-area approaches are very expensive
per watt, so they are currently mostly only used in space missions ---
to power satellites and the like.</p>
<p>Most types of photovoltaic cells continue to work in higher-intensity
light, even working at higher efficiencies [XXX].  If you have mirrors
that cost less per square meter than your solar cells, you can use
mirrors to gather the same amount of sunlight onto a smaller area of
expensive solar cell, for a lower overall system cost.  This sort of
thing is called a "solar concentrator", and there are some
very-large-scale systems that don't even use photovoltaic cells at the
focal point, instead using heat engines like an old-time locomotive,
which can be more efficient at sufficiently high temperatures.</p>
<p><a href="http://guntherportfolio.blogspot.com/2008/05/cool-earth-solar-also-at-big-solar.html">One experimental
project</a>
uses a balloon, half of aluminized mylar, half of transparent mylar,
to make a concave reflector for a small photovoltaic panel.  In
photos, it looks like it generates about "100 suns", or 100 times the
normal intensity of sunlight.  This means that "one watt" of solar
panels, rated according to normal sunlight, can produce 100 watts or a
little more [XXX confirm this], with the aid of a square meter or so
of aluminized mylar, which costs on the order of US$2, and can be
recovered abundantly from garbage in many areas.  However, I suspect
it needs some special cooling [XXX check this].</p>
<p>This kind of setup could theoretically be quite inexpensive and
sturdy, but there are difficulties.  Your hundred-sun system will
suddenly become a zero-sun system if it's not pointed fairly
accurately at the sun, so it requires control motors to follow the sun
across the sky; this adds to the cost, and also reduces reliability.
Your balloons will eventually deflate, and you have to reinflate them.
And on cloudy days, your hundred-sun system is, at best, a one-sun
system.  So most of the production solar concentrators I've heard of
have been large-scale thermal generators.</p>
<p>If your 1m² concentrating mirror cost US$5, your 100cm² 12%-efficient
photovoltaic cell cost US$5, your motors and control system cost
another US$20, and your cooling cost another US$20, you'd have a US$50
system producing about 120 watts, or about US$0.42 per watt.  If you
could upgrade to 24% efficient cells that cost another US$10 (I have
no idea if this price is realistic), you'd have a US$60 system
producing about 240 watts, or about US$0.25 per watt --- even though
the solar-cell component of the system cost 50% more per watt, the
system as a whole cost less per watt.  In this way, photovoltaic
concentrator systems can economically take advantage of more expensive
photovoltaic materials, as long as the solar cells themselves are a
small part of the cost of the system.</p>
<p>You would think that this kind of technology would have been adopted
wholesale long ago, since it would appear to cost dramatically less
per watt than fossil-fuel plants, not even counting the cost of the
fuels.  So there must be some difficulties that have prevented it from
achieving the kind of efficiencies I've suggested above, at least
scalably.</p>
<p>There are various experimental systems working on this principle:

(see also the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/18718/">Technology Review
article</a>), </p>
<p>In summary: photovoltaic solar concentrators could, in theory, provide
electrical generating capacity for US$0.05--US$0.50 per watt with
current technology, and I don't know of any practical reason this
potential won't be realized.  But I also don't know why it hasn't
already been realized, say ten or fifteen years ago, and there must be
a reason; and maybe that reason still applies.</p>
