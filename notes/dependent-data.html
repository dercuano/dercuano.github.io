<p>It should be possible to “perform in-memory computations on large,
even decentralized clusters in a fault-tolerant manner”, as Apache
Spark does, using <a href="http://www.vestasys.org/">Vesta</a>-like build-step isolation, but with the shell
usability of <code>redo</code>, using a <code>git-annex</code>-like blob backend, thus
expanding the applicability of Spark-like computational structures far
beyond the data center.</p>
<p>This requires substantial explanation.</p>
<h2>Spark</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~matei/papers/2012/nsdi_spark.pdf">Apache Spark</a> is a system for making high-performance,
fault-tolerant clusters easy to use, by generating and managing things
Spark calls RDDs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]n RDD is a read-only, partitioned collection of records.  RDDs
can only be created through deterministic operations on either
(1) data in stable storage or (2) other RDDs.…an RDD has enough
information about how it was derived from other datasets (its
<em>lineage</em>) to <em>compute</em> its partitions from data in stable storage.…
in essence, a program cannot reference an RDD that it cannot
reconstruct after a failure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds terribly similar to <code>make</code> and software source control and
build systems, doesn’t it?</p>
<h2>redo</h2>
<p>In 2010, <a href="http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201012#14">Avery Pennarun implemented Dan Bernstein’s <code>redo</code>
design</a>, which is a simpler approach to what <code>make</code> does.  If you
want to build a file named <code>foo.o</code>, you run <code>redo foo.o</code>, and <code>redo</code>
will run the shell script <code>foo.o.do</code> if it exists, or otherwise
<code>default.o.do</code> if it exists, or otherwise <code>default.do</code>, searching up
the filesystem hierarchy.  This <code>.do</code> file is expected to put the
desired contents of <code>foo.o</code> into an output file whose name is passed
to it.</p>
<p>A minimal useful <code>default.o.do</code> might say</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>redo-ifchange "$2".c; cc "$2".c -o "$3"
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first command there is a recursive invocation of <code>redo</code>, which
tells <code>redo</code> that this output file is going to depend on <code>foo.c</code>, so
it had better make sure <code>foo.c</code> is up-to-date before continuing.  This
dependency is recorded for later.  (<code>redo-ifchange</code> takes multiple
arguments to build dependencies in parallel.)</p>
<p>A more complete <code>default.o.do</code> would take <code>#include</code> dependencies into
account.</p>
<p><code>redo</code> does have a couple of limitations.  One is that it doesn’t
handle multiple output files, like those from <code>yacc</code>, very well.
Another is that it is purely local; it doesn’t have a cluster mode,
although you may be able to use <code>distcc</code> to get some of that
yumminess.</p>
<h2>ccache</h2>
<p><a href="https://ccache.samba.org/manual.html">ccache</a> is a build accelerator specific to C, C++, and Objective-C.
It hashes your source code, include files, compiler (well, typically
just its size, mtime, and name), command-line options, etc., with MD4,
and stores the compiler’s output (including e.g. warning messages) in
an on-disk cache in, normally, your home directory; future
recompilation attempts whose inputs haven’t changed will just reuse
the previous compiler output.</p>
<p>In theory, this means that you could get most of the benefits of
<code>make</code> for C and especially C++ programs by just wrapping your
compiler in <code>ccache</code> inside your build script; rerunning the build
script would rehash all your source files, copy the object files into
your current directory, and then relink the executable.  Depending on
what you’re compiling, this might be almost instantaneous, or it might
be very slow.</p>
<p>Because Unix provides <code>ccache</code> with no reliable way to get a secure
hash of the source files from the filesystem, it has to read them in
their entirety to figure out whether they have reverted to an old
version.  I tried it just now on my netbook on a tiny three-kilobyte
GLUT program, and it ended up reading about a megabyte of <code>.h</code> files
in order to figure out that it could safely reuse the 2.7kB <code>.o</code> file
from a previous compilation, taking 39 milliseconds in all, even
though it made only about 365 system calls.</p>
<h2>Database indexes</h2>
<p>Suppose I do this:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; create table foo (x varchar, y varchar);
sqlite&gt; create index foox on foo (x);
sqlite&gt; insert into foo values (3, 4);
sqlite&gt; insert into foo values (4, 5);
</code></pre>
<p><code>foox</code> is the name of an index, which is a sorted copy of a column <code>x</code>
of table <code>foo</code> with rowids.</p>
<p>Now, if I do a query on <code>foo</code> like <code>select * from foo where x = 3;</code>,
this query can use the index <code>foox</code> to find the relevant rows.  (In
fact, in SQLite3, <code>explain</code> tells me it does, even when there are only
two rows in the table.)</p>
<p>For this to work properly, <code>foox</code> has to be updated every time I
insert a new row into <code>foo</code>.  But this is tricky!  If I have a million
rows in <code>foo</code> and I add a new one whose <code>x</code> value is close to the
minimum of the <code>x</code> values, then if <code>foox</code> is simply stored as a
vector, the database might have to move a million values down by one
in order to make room for the new <code>x</code> in its proper sorted order.
There are several solutions to this, but the typical one (and what
SQLite does) is to store your index in a B-tree, which allows you
insert in the middle of it relatively efficiently.</p>
<p>A different approach, and more or less the one Lucene uses, is to
accumulate your updates in a small “side file” until there are a lot
of them, and then apply all of those updates at once to generate a new
sorted <code>foox</code>.  Until <code>foox</code> has been replaced with the new version,
every query to <code>foox</code> must also check the side file to see if there
are updates it’s interested in; this can be made more efficient by
sorting the side file, at which point you may begin to desire to have
a side file for the side file.</p>
<p>The database index is data that depends on the table, and it needs to
be possible to incrementally and transparently recompute that data
when the table changes.  This is the same kind of automatic
recomputation problem that Spark, <code>make</code>, and <code>redo</code> attempt to solve.</p>
<h2>Vesta</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-177.pdf" title="DEC SRC RR-177">Vesta</a> is a source-control system integrated with a build system;
it versions your whole build environment, and it runs each build step
in an isolated chroot environment where it can only access data via
Vesta, which functions as an NFS server.  This ensures that the build
step is only accessing a particular version of the source file, of the
compiler, etc., and that Vesta can correctly record these dependencies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Vesta was proprietary for many years before finally
being released publicly, at which point its authors stopped
maintaining it; it had its own purely-functional programming language
that you were required to use to describe the build process for your
system; because its build scripts were written in that same language,
building it from source required having a running instance of Vesta;
and, since access was provided via an NFS-server interface, you had to
have root (at a time before it was commonplace and easy to run virtual
machines in VirtualBox, QEMU, or EC2) to try it.  Vesta was used in
production by DEC’s Alpha processor design team for a couple of years,
but perhaps because of obstacles like those mentioned above, it never
achieved wide usage, even within DEC or Compaq.</p>
<h2>git-annex</h2>
<p><a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/">git-annex</a> does not do any dependency management.  Instead, it
manages an efficient, decentralized, redundant immutable blob store
with decentralized, replicated, eventually-consistent metadata, built
on top of git.  It uses symlinks to permission-read-only files to
provide normal filesystem access to the immutable blobs without going
to the lengths of implementing its own filesystem, as Vesta does; this
is usually enough to prevent you from accidentally corrupting your
local copy of the blobs, and if you do corrupt one copy of a blob, you
can still restore it from a remote repository.</p>
<h2>Spark, simplified and made flexible</h2>
<p>Spark has the lineage and determinism stuff unnecessarily coupled to a
bunch of stuff about keeping Java objects in memory and partitioning
and records, which seems like it is somewhat extraneous, although
apparently Java does kind of need that in order to run efficiently.
(You’d think java.nio.MappedByteBuffer would have largely eliminated
this problem, but apparently not.)  Spark’s ability to “perform
in-memory computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner”
does not depend in any way on Spark’s knowledge of the internal
structure of partitions (that they contain records) nor of Spark’s
knowledge of which partitions are associated together to form an RDD.
All Spark needs to know to recreate a chunk of data is really how to
redo the computation that created that chunk, and how to recreate the
inputs that went into that computation.</p>
<p>However, unlike <code>redo</code>, in-memory computations on large clusters
definitely need to be able to produce multiple output chunks, or
partitions or whatever.  And, if those chunks are stored in
distributed memory on a cluster, it’s probably a good idea to send the
computation to where the data is.</p>
<p>Also, the granularity of the computation is likely larger than what
<code>redo</code> has to deal with, which means that the system has more latitude
to do computations and heavy-duty setup than in <code>redo</code> or <code>make</code>.  It
could run an A* search, for example, to choose among possible
alternative plans.</p>
<p>So here’s what I propose.  Build steps nest.  Build steps run in a
contained environment, like what lxc provides, or if that’s not
possible, a directory full of symlinks to read-only files from a
git-annex-like chunk store.  When you launch a build step, which you
can do from the Unix command line, you explicitly list its input
files, including the script for the build step, which causes them to
appear in its contained environment.  When it terminates, it leaves
behind an output directory.  All of the input and output files, as
well as the directories containing them, are stored in a distributed
chunk store, and their provenance is recorded in a distributed,
replicated metadata store; this is very similar to git-annex.  Build
steps are presumed to be deterministic, and they are isolated from
their environment to the extent possible, which reduces their
nondeterminism.  So, if you invoke a build step for which the system
already has the results cached, it will retrieve those results from
the chunk store.  And the system may invoke the build step on a remote
machine, if that's where the data is, and then replicate the results
onto your local machine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Sandbox-applications-quickly-with-KVM-or-LXC-1429268.html">Lxc/virt-sandbox might impose some 200ms launch overhead on build
steps</a>, but that should probably be okay.  If it’s not,
Debian has <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/fakechroot">fakechroot</a>, which is an extremely efficient way to use
a wrapper library to fake out some system calls to trick programs into
thinking they don’t have access to the whole filesystem.</p>
<p>This allows you to write your build script as a shell script, which
can invoke other scripts, possibly in a loop, and use their results.
Once you have run your build script, which will usually be
instantaneous, you can be sure that all of the build results are
present.</p>
<p>When a build step invokes a subordinate build step, it names the input
files it wants to provide to the subordinate step using the filenames
it knows them by, and optionally put them at a particular place in the
child’s namespace; but the system invoking the subordinate step uses
their immutable blob hashes in the hash keys, not the filenames known
by the parent build step.  This means that the same build step,
running the same commands identically many times in different
contexts, can invoke a sub-build-step that does different things.</p>
<p>The top-level build script might also snapshot other parts of the
firesystem, copying them into the blob repository, in order to make
them available to subordinate build steps.  For example, substantial
parts of /lib and /usr/lib may be necessary.</p>
<p>(It would be nice to use <a href="https://sysdig.com/sysdig-vs-dtrace-vs-strace-a-technical-discussion/">sysdig</a> or strace or something to figure out
what files are actually being accessed, without having to write a
filesystem.)</p>
<h2>Lazy concatenation and merging</h2>
<p>Ideally you could concatenate several chunks into a single big output
file in a purely virtual way, i.e. without actually copying the data.</p>
<h2>Performance back-of-the-envelope</h2>
<p>I have an 800-gigabyte stock-market data set.  If this were split into
chunks of some 64 megabytes, it would be about 12500 chunks.  If I
generate another 200 gigabytes of derived data from that, it will be
another 3125 chunks.  If each of those chunks derived from, say, 400
input chunks, the SHA-1s of all of those chunks (the lineage) would be
8 kilobytes; all the metadata together would be 25 megabytes.
Incrementally replicating 25 megabytes of lineage data will be no
problem.</p>
<h2>Small-memory performance</h2>
<p>One of the interesting things about MapReduce is that any algorithm
that can be expressed with it can be implemented with a small number
of sequential passes over the data, so you can use it to improve
locality of reference as well as for fault-tolerant cluster-scalable
computation.</p>
<p>Although this approach is not nearly as extreme as MapReduce in that
way, it may also have some virtue in that direction, since it
encourages you to break up your computation into small pieces that
consume a few small inputs and produce a few small outputs; in cases
like the Spark reimplementation of the Pregel programming model, this
may involve “transposing” an algorithm, separating things that were
previously together and bringing together things that were previously
separate.  If you were to run only one build step at a time, you might
be able to improve your in-memory performance dramatically.</p>

<p>Well, it’s been a year and still nobody has done the above, so I guess
I should do some work on it.  What does a minimal executable version
of it look like?</p>
<p>Maybe you have these pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>a content-hash-addressable store which distinguishes between source
  data and cached data;</li>
<li>a caching service which maps hashes of (deterministic) commands to
  hashes of their output;</li>
<li>an execution service which returns the results of commands, either
  from cache or by computing them;</li>
<li>a container to run commands in which grants them access only to read
  the data in their manifest and to produce an output tree;</li>
<li>an ability for commands to delegate their output tree to further
  commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you really need all of those?  What does the interface to creating
output files look like?</p>
<p>Maybe a first step would be to think about what distributed MapReduce
in this context looks like.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
