(2 minutes)</div><p>Switching power supplies generate a lot of electrical noise.  The AVR
has the option of temporarily halting everything on the chip except
the ADC during an analog-to-digital conversion in order to remove
sources of noise.  Could you shut off a switching power supply during
analog-to-digital conversions in order to get further precision?</p>
<p>You’d need to have a big enough capacitor to keep the processor going,
plus perhaps adequate voltage regulation.</p>
<p>If you were running an AVR ATMega328 on 5V, well, its “typical” power
consumption is listed as 1.2 mA when idle at 8 MHz on 5V; we can
safely extrapolate to 3 mA at 20 MHz.  A 10-bit conversion takes it
260 μs.  Let’s say it’s safe to let the voltage droop from 5.45 V to
4.55 V during that time (hopefully this 20% variation in input voltage
during the conversion won’t hork the ADC).  This requires the
capacitor to be at least 870 nanofarads, which is eminently feasible,
even in a low-L MLCC.</p>
<p>If this would cause problems for the ADC, you could charge the
capacitor up to a higher voltage and use a linear voltage regulator
(perhaps an LDO for efficiency) in between the capacitor and the
microcontroller.  Then the ADC wouldn’t see a changing reference
voltage.</p>
<p>So it this approach seems workable.  It requires that you not be
spending all your time doing conversions, though, because otherwise
your switcher is going to be generating even more noise that will keep
ringing through the system during conversions.</p>
<p>Oh hey, I think it can actually do a 10-bit conversion in more like
67 μs at a higher clock rate.  This reduces the required capacitor to
more like 220 nF.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
