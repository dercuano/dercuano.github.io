(2 minutes)</div><p>I opened my mailbox in Thunderbird.</p>
<ul>
<li>importing the mailbox is a pain</li>
<li>had to create a dummy account first</li>
<li>takes a number of minutes to open the mailbox</li>
<li>uses 800-950MB of VM and 400+MB of <code>RPRVT</code> memory to open the mailbox</li>
<li>sorts by default by date message claims to be sent, although there
  seem to be anomalies; this clusters spam</li>
<li>uses 7-9 minutes of CPU to render a threaded view, during which time
  the UI is unresponsive; when you sort by something else and
  re-enable the threaded view, it takes another 7-9 minutes</li>
<li>is there a way to hide the junk messages?</li>
<li>I marked a bunch of messages as spam and a bunch of other messages
  as read in order to train the junk filter.  Then I (actually
  Beatrice) selected all messages with interesting-feature-A (which
  took less than a minute of CPU time, during which the UI was
  unresponsive) and selected "Run Junk Mail Controls on Folder" from
  the Tools menu.  This marked a number of the messages I'd marked as
  read, but not as spam, as spam.  There is no obvious way to
  distinguish the messages that I have marked as spam and the messages
  Thunderbird has marked as spam.</li>
<li>on the plus side, Thunderbird doesn't seem to want to store its
  updates to message status flags as Status: headers in the messages.</li>
<li>on the minus side, it seems to be storing that information in a
  176MB Mork file, which could make it hard to get it into anything
  else.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that Thunderbird isn't storing
  which-message-is-read information in Status: headers, it seems to
  believe Status: headers added by spammers.</li>
<li>Thunderbird thinks I have about 500 000 messages in this mailbox.
  But I actually have about 800 000.</li>
<li>Scrollbars are not useful on a 500 000-item list.</li>
