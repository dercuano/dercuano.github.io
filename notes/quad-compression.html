(9 minutes)</div><p>I wrote an Arduino program to generate musical scores with the
following strategy: first, generate M 4-beat measures, each beat
containing a note or not; then generate M 4-measure sequences from
those measures; then generate M 4-sequence supersequences of 16
measures each; then generate M 4-supersequence hypersequences of 64
measures each; then use one or more of these 256-beat hypersequences
as your score.</p>
<p>This worked reasonably well, fit the whole score into 128 bytes (I
used one byte per sequence element and M=8, so each of the four levels
was 8*4 = 32 bytes), and allowed me to encode the iteration state into
a single byte.  If I'd pressed harder, I could have used three bits
per sequence element, for 4×8×4×3 = 48 bytes, except that I actually
was using four bits per note.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that perhaps you could use this approach for other
things, like general-purpose data compression or image compression,
which I haven't tried yet, or building a pseudo-character-cell
terminal with very low RAM requirements.</p>
<p>A typical character-cell terminal, like a VT100 or H-19, had about
25×80 character cells, each with about 5×8 pixels; and either one or
two bytes of RAM per character cell, plus a ROM font containing
something like 5×8×128 bits, say, 640 bytes.  Each scanline could be
built on the fly out of bits read out of the ROM, indexed by some
simple arithmetic, so you only needed some 2000 bytes of RAM instead
of the 80 000 (400×200) you'd need for a full screen image.</p>
<p>Suppose, instead, you used this quadtree scheme, but with a slightly
unusual aspect ratio: 5×8-pixel characters, 16 lines, 128 columns, for
2048 characters on screen.  Each character position would have a byte,
as before, but instead of having a byte for each possible character
position, you'd have M groups of four bytes for distinct 2×2 squares,
where M was something less than 512.  You'd need four levels of these,
with each block at each level corresponding to respectively 4, 16, 64,
and 256 character positions, plus 8 bytes at the top level for the 8
horizontal 16×16 chunks of the screen.</p>
<p>What would M be?  You'd probably want it to be 256 or less in order to
be able to fit the pointers to the next level into a byte; suppose it
were 128.  Then each level of the hierarchy would be 512 bytes (128
blocks of 4 bytes) and the total would be 2048+8 = 2056 bytes to hold
the screen contents.</p>
<p>So far this sounds stupid, because you've "compressed" 2048 bytes into
2056 while losing the ability to have an arbitrary 2048 bytes on the
screen!  But there are some interesting possibilities here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't really need M=128 for the top.  The top level of quadtree
  can only have a max of 8 of its nodes displayed at once.  This
  approach means you could have M=8 and 32 for the top couple of
  levels, cutting the memory usage almost in half, to (+ 8 (* 8 4) (*
  32 4) 512 512) = 1192 bytes.  You can use some of those bytes to
  give you "spare" blocks at the upper levels, to expand M further
  beyond 128 for the bottom level (so you can have, say, 1024 bytes of
  incompressible text at the bottom level).</li>
<li>Scrolling horizontally by a multiple of 16 columns just involves
  changing the 8 data pointers at the top level, and possibly
  constructing a new "blank node" at each lower level.</li>
<li>Scrolling by 8 lines, half a screenful, just involves modifying the
  32 bytes that control the contents of the top-level quadtree nodes.</li>
<li>You can use the saved RAM for a soft font, which gives you the
  ability to draw arbitrary graphics!  As long as they're repetitive
  and compressible.</li>
<li>If your terminal is programmable, you could use video RAM you're not
  using at the moment (because nothing points to it at the moment) for
  buffers and code.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would probably make more sense to make your nodes horizontal
instead of square.  This means adjacent lines of text no longer
interfere with each other's compressibility.  Then you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>level T0, 256 nodes of four consecutive characters per node;</li>
<li>level T1, 128 nodes of 16 consecutive characters per node;</li>
<li>level T2, 32 nodes of 64 consecutive characters per node;</li>
<li>level L1, eight nodes of two lines of 128 characters each;</li>
<li>level L2, two nodes of eight lines;</li>
<li>level L3, two bytes pointing to L2 nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total is (+ 2 (* 2 4) (* 8 4) (* 32 4) (* 128 4) (* 256 4)) = 1706
bytes, saving about 300 bytes over the traditional representation, at
the cost of cutting the possible incompressible text on the screen in
half.</p>
<p>Suppose that, instead of using the 5×8 characters that were common at
the time, you took the quadtree approach all the way down to the
pixels, using 8×16-pixel characters, just with a higher clock rate.
Then you'd have, say, three more levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level P0: 4 8-pixel scanlines of a character, stacked vertically.</li>
<li>Level P1: 16 scanlines of a character vertically, i.e. an entire
  cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical font ROM would likely be highly compressible with this
approach, since lots of characters contain blank lines (not containing
ascenders or descenders, say) and other repeated features.  Suppose we
have 96 ROM font characters, and each P0 node is used an average of
twice.  Then we have 96*8 bytes for the P0 nodes and 96*4 bytes for
the P2 nodes.  But that's assuming significant horizontal slices of
characters are shared. That puts us at a total of 1152 bytes of ROM.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I was thinking was that if you had another 32 nodes in P2
that were in RAM (128 bytes), you could use that for a graphical
character set, especially if you have another 128 bytes or so of P0 to
play with.</p>
<p>But what about the latency of all these levels of indirection?  We're
talking about a total of eight indirections to get down to the pixels,
now, right?  Wouldn't that cut way down on your effective dot clock?</p>
<p>I think the answer is "no", because although there are lots of
indirections, they're very <em>predictable</em> indirections, in lots of
different memories, so you can pipeline them.  A four-byte FIFO at
most levels would suffice: P0 needs only two 8-bit output registers,
one of which is shifted to the electron gun, and a new output byte is
latched into the "next byte" register; P1 similarly needs only a
one-byte buffer, which feeds the next address to P0 for when it's
ready; T0 fills up a four-byte FIFO going to P1 every 16 pixels of the
scan line; T1 fills up a four-byte FIFO going to T0 every 64 pixels;
T2 fills up a four-byte FIFO going to T1 every 256 pixels; L1 fills up
a four-byte memory that T2 reads 32 times every 32 scanlines, or 32768
pixels; L2 fills up a four-byte FIFO going to L1 every eight lines, or
128 scanlines, or 131072 pixels; and L3 feeds L2 a byte every eight
lines, or twice a screen.  Each of the next-pointer reads can be
loaded into a double-buffered register as soon as the previous value
is used, so it's not in the latency critical path.  P0, P1, and T0
each need to read a random byte every 8 dot clock cycles; T2 every 64;
L1 every 65536; etc.  So anything slightly over a single byte read per
2 dot clock cycles should be sufficient.  Since we're talking about a
(* 60 8 16 128 16) = 15 728 640 Hz dot clock, that would probably have
involved separate hardware memories for some of these in the 1970s
time period we're talking about, just to keep the RAM reads down to a
manageable level, below 8 megabytes per second per channel.</p>
<p>However, I think this approach should make it possible to do a
megabit windowing system on a terminal with on the order of 6kiB of
RAM, rather than the usual 128kiB.</p>
<p>What about using this approach to generate random images?</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
