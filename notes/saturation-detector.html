(3 minutes)</div><p>Ferromagnetic materials have very high magnetic permeability, but
saturate at some point; in some cases, especially for extremely
ferromagnetic materials like the electrical steel used in
transformers, the transition is quite abrupt.</p>
<p>A major problem in the historical development of radio was the
"detector": some way of converting the high-frequency AC signal of the
detected radio wave into a DC or low-frequency signal that could be
used, for example, to activate a solenoid.  This was eventually solved
by the development of the vacuum-tube diode and later the
semiconductor junction diode, but before that, there were a number of
Rube Goldberg contraptions, some of which remained in use for a long
time in special circumstances: the "coherer", which sintered metal
particles together with the RF energy and then measured the DC
resistance of the result; the "cat's-whisker detector", a delicate
Schottky diode made with a point contact between a finely-pointed wire
and a crystal of a semiconductor such as galena, iron pyrite,
carborundum, or even the iron oxide on a razor blade of a "foxhole
radio"; Marconi's "magnetic detector", which used the nonlinear
hysteresis behavior of moving iron wire to convert an RF magnetic
field into a tiny DC voltage; and Fessenden's "electrolytic detector",
which used the electrolytic formation of a layer of bubbles on a fine
platinum wire electrode to preferentially impede current in one
direction.  Somewhat related is the "mercury-vapor rectifier", which
uses the enormous difference in work function between mercury and
graphite to conduct in only one direction.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that the saturation transition in low-hysteresis
electrical steel could be used to form a detector for frequencies up
to some limit, as follows.  You bias the primary winding of an
iron-core transformer almost to saturation with DC, then superimpose
the AC signal on it.  The part of the AC signal opposing the DC bias
will dip into the high-permeability region and will therefore see
strong inductive effects --- a high impedance, either inductive (in
the case of an open-circuit secondary winding) or resistive (in the
case of a dummy load connected across the secondary).  The part of the
AC signal in concert with the DC bias will experience much smaller
inductive effects, perhaps two orders of magnitude less.</p>
<p>This should give you an entirely-solid-state "detector" that works
without any semiconductors or vacuums.</p>
<p>I think this device is limited in frequency only by hysteresis and
eddy-current losses, which increase linearly with frequency.  In this
application, though, much larger losses are acceptable than in the
usual applications of transformers: a 1%-efficient detector is still
usable.  Wikipedia tells me that laminated-steel transformers with
especially thin laminations are still sometimes used at 10kHz, so I am
guessing that this detector should work usably with a steel core up to
some 100kHz, and with ferrite or powdered iron, up to 1GHz.</p>
<p>You should be able to substitute a permanent magnet for the DC bias,
eliminating the need for a power supply.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
