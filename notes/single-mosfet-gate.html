<p>If we interpret “connected to power supply” as a 1 bit and
“unconnected to power supply” as a 0 bit, a single SPDT
electromechanical relay can compute any of the following logic
functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Buffering and NOT, with the input signal and ground connected
   across the winding and the power supply connected to the armature.
   Of course this use of relays is what they were invented for and why
   they’re called “relays”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AND and AND-NOT (abjunction), with a second input signal instead of
   the power supply connected to the armature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is in some sense very device-efficient, computing as it does two
separate logic operations per relay.  With DPDT relays, you can
compute even more.  This signaling scheme also permits arbitrary use
of wired-OR, which means it’s eminently bus-compatible.</p>
<p>Relays, being electromagnetic rather than electrostatic devices, are
not troubled by floating inputs.  If we use a different signaling
scheme, in which “connected to power supply” is 1 and “connected to
ground” is 0, then the situation changes somewhat.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Buffering connects the input signal and ground across the winding,
   the power supply to the normally open contact, ground to the
   normally closed contact, and the armature to the output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOT is the same, but with the connections to the contacts reversed,
   or alternatively with the input signal and the power supply
   connected across the winding.  Making both changes converts the
   relay back into a buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AND connects input signal A and ground across the winding, input
   signal B to the normally open contact, and ground to the normally
   closed contact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AND-NOT is the same, but with the contacts reversed, or the
   connections to the winding reversed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XOR connects the two input signals to the two sides of the winding,
   power and ground to the normally closed and normally open contacts
   respectively, and the output to the armature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reversing the power and ground on XOR gives you XNOR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OR can no longer be done with a wired-or; that’s a short.  But you
   can connect input signal A and ground across the winding, power to
   the normally-open contact, and input signal B to the normally
   closed contact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t see a way to build NAND or NOR as single relays in this
   system; I think you need two separate relays to compute one of
   them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You still want to use the other signaling scheme for buses, so you
need a sort of level-shifter relay.</p>
<h2>CMOS logic</h2>
<p>Normal CMOS logic uses four MOSFETs per two-input NAND or NOR gate.
Although this is very simple compared to a TTL gate, you could desire
something more parsimonious if you’re going to build stuff out of
discrete MOSFETs.  MOSFETs share with relays the property that when
they are switched “on”, they have a low-resistance, electrically
isolated, bidirectional path between the source and drain electrodes.
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could use a single MOSFET as a
multiple-input logic gate, rather than needing several of them?</p>
<p>I haven’t been able to figure out a way to do this.  There are a
few different obstacles.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There’s nothing equivalent to the first signaling scheme, where one
   of the bits is represented by letting the input float.  When a
   MOSFET input is left to float, it capacitively retains whatever
   value it had before, or possibly whatever capacitive charge is
   induced on it by electrical fields in the vicinity.  You can of
   course tie down all your MOSFET inputs with pullup or pulldown
   resistors, but then you have at minimum two devices per gate, not
   one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOSFET <em>outputs</em> are either connected to the input or left to
   float.  That means that if you want to connect the output to one of
   two different things (such as ground or Vdd, or ground and an input
   signal) you need two MOSFETs, not one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOSFET signaling voltages are somewhat troublesome;
   enhancement-mode n-channel MOSFETs are turned off when the gate
   voltage is the same as the source, and the “source” is really
   whichever of the source and drain is more negative.  If you bring
   the gate voltage up, it starts to allow current to flow.
   Depletion-mode MOSFETs at first seem more promising, since you have
   conduction until you apply a gate voltage to cut it off, but now
   your gate voltage has to be <em>negative</em> compared to the source.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know if subthreshold behavior might have an answer; otherwise
I suspect that single-MOSFET gates are not going to work.</p>
<p>A MOSFET version of RTL, however, works quite easily, with <a href="http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4440016/Single-MOSFET-circuits-gate---modulate">one MOSFET
and up to a few resistors per gate</a>.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
