<p>I have a fairly clear idea of what stuff I want to be studying right
now, which has taken some time to congeal.  There are 18 major themes:
constraint satisfaction,
mathematical optimization,
 logic,
 interval arithmetic,
 tensor or array computation,
 physical system simulation including finite element analysis,
 automated manufacturing or digital fabrication,
 incremental computation and caching,
 reproducibility,
 archival and publishing,
real-time computation,
 anytime algorithms,
 probabilistic programming,
neural networks,
 decentralization,
 self-replicating machinery,
 self-sustaining software systems,
 and physical security.  These seemingly disparate themes actually have an
underlying unity, which I will attempt to explain.</p>
<h2>Constraint satisfaction</h2>
<p>Constraint satisfaction systems search for a configuration that
satisfies some set of boolean conditions.  Sometimes the configuration
may be continuously variable, like a point in ℝⁿ.  Other times it may
be discrete, like a set of choices for a set of Boolean variables.  It
may have finite dimensionality (like ℝⁿ), infinite dimensionality
(like a function ℝ → ℝ), or finite but unbounded dimensionality (like
a sentence in some formal language).  The conditions may be simple and
tractable (things like “x &gt; 0”) or very hairy indeed (“md5(x) ==
0xd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e”, which looks computationally
intractable but is actually fairly easy).</p>
<p>The parts of the configuration are sometimes called “design variables”.</p>
<p>Different kinds of constraint satisfaction problems have different
algorithms available to solve them.  Most of classical algebra and
integral and differential calculus consist of algorithms for solving
particular kinds of constraints.  You’re given a constraint like 2x² +
4x = 30 and your objective is to find an x that satisfies that
constraint, traditionally by deducing logical consequences from that
given constraint until it’s trivial to compute the answer.  For
example, from that equation we can deduce x² + 2x = 15, then x² + 2x -
15 = 0, then (x - 3)(x + 5) = 0, and x=3 ∨ x=-5.</p>
<p>You can think of a constraint as a generalization of the notion of a
function — it’s a function that can “run backwards”, so to speak.
This can significantly simplify the process of developing a piece of
software, thus amplifying the intellectual abilities of its author.
Often it is significantly easier to express attributes of the desired
results of a program (consider the MD5 example above) than how to
compute them.  In some such cases, it’s even possible for existing
constraint-satisfaction software to find the results.</p>
<p>MiniKANREN is one of the more interesting pieces of
constraint-satisfaction software becoming available today.  The
burgeoning field of efficient SAT and SMT solvers such as Z3 contains
many others.</p>
<p>Aside from the rapid advances in the efficiency of satisfiability
algorithms, larger and larger constraint-satisfaction problems are
coming within reach as memories and CPUs dramatically increase in
power.  A crude understanding of complexity theory might lead you to
think that this won’t matter much, because SAT is not known to be in
P, so even a CPU that is 256 times faster will only allow you to
expand the feasible problem size by 8 bits.  But in fact the base of
the exponential has been brought down far below 2 and continues to
diminish.</p>
<h2>Mathematical optimization</h2>
<p>Mathematical optimization is the problem of finding a configuration
that maximizes (or minimizes) some objective (or loss) function,
subject to some feasibility constraints.  The classic example — and
indeed nearly the only one considered in many textbooks on
mathematical optimization today — is linear programming, where the
feasibility constraints are linear inequalities and the objective
function is linear.</p>
<p>Categories of algorithms for mathematical optimization are called
“metaheuristics”, which is a somewhat misleading name but gives some
clue of how broadly applicable they are.  Random guessing, hill
climbing, gradient descent, gradient descent with random restarts, and
genetic algorithms are widely-used metaheuristics.</p>
<h3>Constraint satisfaction and optimization</h3>
<p>Optimization can be seen as a generalization of constraint
satisfaction in a few different ways.</p>
<p>Clearly if you can find the optimal configuration among all feasible
configurations, then you can find at least one feasible configuration,
which is the constraint satisfaction problem.  So, from this point of
view, algorithms to solve optimization problems can solve constraint
satisfaction problems too, but it might be easier to say </p>
<p>Also, though, you can conceptualize the constraints of a
constraint-satisfaction problem as real-valued functions that are
multiplied together, where those functions take the value 1 when the
constraint is satisfied and 0 otherwise.  Then, finding a maximum of
the product is equivalent to finding a solution to the constraints.
Many optimization algorithms will have an easier time if those factor
functions are instead continuous and between 0 and 1 when the
condition is false.  And in fact this sort of thing is a common method
(the “penalty method”) for incorporating constraints into optimization
problems for solvers that don’t natively handle constraints.  The very
first constraint-satisfaction system for mechanical design, Sketchpad,
apparently used gradient-descent to search for approximate solutions
to geometrical constraint systems.</p>
<p>However, constraint satisfaction algorithms can also be used to solve
optimization problems if you invoke them many times.  If your
objective function is y, you first seek a solution for y &gt; 0.  If
successful, you seek a solution for y &gt; 1; if successful, a solution
for y &gt; 4; if successful, a solution for y &gt; 8; and so on until you
fail, at which point you can approximate the optimum as closely as
desired using binary search.</p>
<h2>Logic</h2>
<p>Logic is a very broad term, but in particular what I’m interested in
are theorem provers and predicate logic, which can produce
machine-checkable proofs of mathematical propositions — whether
propositions of general interest, such as (most famously) the
four-color theorem, or propositions having to do with particular
pieces of software.</p>
<p>There is a lot of work currently going on in this space, with systems
like Coq, Agda, Idris, Isabelle-HOL, Z3, Mizar, and Epigram being
actively developed, and systems like CompCert and seL4 being proved.</p>
<p>Much of the initial work on program correctness came from a desire to
ensure that all programs were correct, for reasons having to do with
the risk-averse nature of military bureaucracies, rather than any kind
of rational cost-benefit analysis.  But in practice, many programs do
not even have a well-defined specification that they could conceivably
fail to conform to, nor is it a good use of the irreplaceable million
or less hours of a human being’s life to write one.  It’s often
adequate to try things and see what happens.</p>
<p>To me, proving programs correct is of interest for four reasons:
compiler optimization, user interface innovations, software security,
and embedded systems.</p>
<p>It’s interesting for compiler optimization because if an unoptimized
program can be proven equivalent to the original program, the
correctness of the optimizer or optimizers is a moot point, and indeed
some kind of random search over all feasible programs may be adequate
(as Sorav Bansal proposed in his thesis, <em>Peephole
Superoptimization</em>).</p>
<p>(Note that “optimization” here is used in a sense unrelated to the
“Mathematical optimization” section above.)</p>
<p>It’s interesting for user interface innovations because the
interactive process of creating a machine-checkable proof with a proof
assistant like Coq is very different from the traditional
batch-job-inspired workflow of writing a program in a text editor in a
compiled language and then feeding it to a compiler.  I don’t have
enough experience with this process yet to figure out whether it has
innovations that can be applied more widely to the process of creating
things using computers.</p>
<p>It’s interesting for software security because trying things and
seeing what happens is never adequate to produce secure software,
although it may be adequate to find security holes.  Often when a
security hole is detected in the field, it is already too late to
prevent disastrous effects.  So significant effort toward other ways
to prevent them seems like it would be justified.</p>
<p>It’s interesting for embedded systems for a somewhat similar reason.</p>
<p>If my production database server crashes, the production cluster can
fail over to a secondary and save the logs and a core dump, and in the
morning I can inspect the core dump and the logs to figure out what
went wrong.  Then I can fix the bug, recompile the database software,
and upgrade across the cluster.  The cost of the failure is low
(assuming it wasn’t a security hole), and it’s highly inspectable and
reparable.</p>
<p>By contrast, if the software on the Arduino controlling an autonomous
toy car, the car may be run over by a truck, and possibly all the
Arduino can do to make the error debuggable is to blink an LED.  It
doesn’t have space for a core dump.  The cost of the failure is high,
and it’s poorly inspectable and reparable.  (The situation is even
worse if it’s an automatic implantable defibrillator.)</p>
<p>So for embedded systems, it’s highly desirable to detect errors at
compile time rather than run time.</p>
<h3>Logic and constraint satisfaction</h3>
<p>In some sense, theorem-proving is merely an application of constraint
satisfaction: you have some set of axioms and inference rules which
you’ve previously decided are reasonable or at least consistent, and
you’re searching for a proof which starts from those axioms, is valid
according to those inference rules, and ends with your desired
conclusion.  That’s clearly a constraint-satisfaction problem.</p>
<p>But constraint satisfaction is also merely an application of
theorem-proving.  A constructive theorem prover, given the task of
proving that some set of constraints C is satisfiable, will produce a
constructive proof, which is a way to construct a configuration
satisfying them.  But even a non-constructive prover can be used, at
least for a finite set of design variables; you repeatedly attempt to
prove that a given design variable is in a given range.</p>
<p>This conjunction between constraint-satisfaction systems and logic
systems is sometimes called “constraint logic programming”.</p>
<p>From another angle, all of classical algebra (the equation-solving
stuff, not the modern abstract algebra stuff that grew out of group
theory) is the application of logic to constraint satisfaction.  So
you would think that that kind of theorem-proving logic could be
applied to significantly ease more general kinds of
constraint-satisfaction problems, where the constraints might include
things like arbitrary lookup tables, conditionals, and iteration.</p>
<h3>Logic and optimization</h3>
<p>Both theorem-proving and mathematical optimization intersect with
constraint satisfaction, but their intersections are sort of
complementary.  Theorem-proving is associated with (I’m being vague
here) finite domains, algebraic structures, and various kinds of
backtracking search.  Mathematical optimization is associated with
continuous and therefore infinite domains, analytic structures, and
various kinds of iterative approximation.</p>
<p>But of course in day-to-day math, we often use theorem-proving
techniques (often with pencil and paper) to transform problems of
analysis into tractable forms and even to find closed-form solutions
to them.  So it seems likely that the two approaches are likely to be
complementary in software as well.</p>
<h2>Interval arithmetic</h2>
<p>Interval arithmetic is a means to bound the approximation error on an
approximate calculation by computing on a conservative approximation
of the answer.  The usual arithmetic operations are defined to operate
over intervals of the real line in such a way that the result of the
computation is a conservative approximation of the correct result.  In
general, narrower bounds on the input will result in narrower bounds
on the output, although sometimes not as much as you’d hope.</p>
<p>Interval arithmetic has been most investigated as a way to bound the
approximation error from floating-point roundoff by setting different
rounding modes, at the cost of considerable performance.  However, it
has a number of other applications; probably the best known is precise
and efficient ray-tracing of implicit surfaces, a technique surveyed
broadly in Jorge Eliécer Flórez Díaz’s 2008 dissertation, but which
has been developed continuously over the last quarter-century.  In
this application, it <em>improves</em> performance by avoiding redundant
calculations that will produce the same result.</p>
<h3>Intervals and constraints</h3>
<p>You can use interval arithmetic to solve constraint satisfaction
problems over continuous variables by recursive subdivision of the
problem space, in the same way that I outlined earlier for solving
optimization problems with a constraint solver, except that you may
need to recurse into more than one subinterval.  Treating arithmetic
as constant-time, this approach is probably logarithmic-time in the
required precision and exponential-time in the number of dimensions,
and is therefore not practically applicable to problems of high
dimensionality.</p>
<p>However, it is the only general algorithm I know of for continuous
constraint satisfaction problems, not being limited to finite domains
or to constraints of a particular form, such as linear systems or
polynomials.  (It only requires that the constraints be computable,
which turns out to imply a particular kind of continuity.)</p>
<p>It’s not completely trivial to get right, because strictly speaking,
in the form I’ve described, it only guarantees that it wasn’t able to
prove that <em>no</em> points in the selected region satisfy the constraints,
not that any of them do.  For example, a simple implicit function
grapher I wrote using interval arithmetic suggests that there may be
zeroes anywhere the implicit function has a singularity, because the
result of dividing by an interval containing zero is the interval
(-∞,+∞), which contains 0.  But small regions around such a
singularity will typically not contain any zeroes or even numbers
close to zero.</p>
<p>There are lots of tweaks you can apply to this algorithm, and as with
other kinds of recursive search algorithms, even fairly minor
improvements can have enormous effects on efficiency, since they
exponentially reduce the number of nodes searched.  Some of the things
I’ve been thinking about are priority queues of regions by size, a
tighter interval representation that approximates results by  =a linear
function of input variables over a given input interval, three-way
partitioning, and choosing partition locations to be closer to the
part of the region most likely to be feasible.</p>
<h3>Intervals and optimization</h3>
<p>By the same token, you can use interval arithmetic to solve
mathematical optimization problems by recursive subdivision.</p>
<h3>Intervals and logic</h3>
<p>I don’t know how interval arithmetic combines with theorem proving.</p>
<h2>Array computation</h2>
<p>Array languages are not merely languages which support arrays, as
almost every programming language does.  They are languages in which
arrays are first-class values that support aggregate arithmetic and
computational operations.  They were born in the form of APL in
1957–1962, but in the 1980s spawned S, IDL, and MATLAB, and since then
have spawned the languages R, J, K, A+, and Lush, and the Python
library Numpy, the Perl library PDL, and most recently the
neural-network-focused libraries TensorFlow and Theano.</p>
<p>Typically the arrays are of arbitrary dimensionality, and sometimes
they may be called “tensors” or something else.</p>
<p>Fitting a program into the array-programming style requires a
different kind of thinking than the mainstream record-oriented or
object-oriented style which evolved, as far as I can tell, from 1950s
business data processing on machines with a few kilobytes of RAM and
tape drives.  I find it very awkward.</p>
<p>There are two or three interesting advantages of this way of doing
things that induce me to keep trying it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Efficient execution.  Originally this was only an advantage for
   interpreted implementations like the original APLs, Numpy, or old
   versions of MATLAB; it just pulls the interpretation overhead out
   of your algorithm’s inner loop.  So C and FORTRAN programmers
   scoffed, since at best it got you from wasting 99% of your CPU to
   wasting 50% of it.  Nowadays it’s becoming an advantage even
   compared to C, C++, or Fortran (TensorFlow originated as a C++
   library) because the array aggregate operations can be compiled
   efficiently onto a GPU.  The array operations are generally
   explicitly parallel, rather than implicitly so as more imperative
   code usually is.  (R0ml Lefkowitz is the first person I remember
   making this observation.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terser code.  By making most loops implicit, arguably the code
   strips away much of the inessential implementation complexity and
   reveals the intention of the programmer more clearly.  I feel like
   this can go either way, but this may be a function of my
   inexperience with the paradigm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More abstract and thus more flexible code.  Typically the code
   <code>a*b</code> with an array language or library could mean (in Python
   notation) any of <code>[ai*bi for ai, bi in zip(a, b)]</code>,
   <code>[a*bi for bi in b]</code>, <code>[ai*b for ai in a]</code> just <code>a*b</code>, or even
   <code>[[aij*bij for aij, bij in zip(ai, bi)] for ai, bi in zip(a, b)]</code>,
   and which one depends on which of the two is a vector or array.
   This works to your advantage more often than you’d think; if you
   write a plotting function that takes arrays of X-coordinates,
   Y-coordinates, and point colors, it will generally just fall out
   that you can pass in a single color instead of an array of colors
   when that’s what you want.  This depends, however, on the detailed
   design of the aggregate operations provided by a particular
   language, and sometimes it fails in surprising ways.  (And I’m not
   sure it applies at all to TensorFlow and Theano.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve been thinking for a while about how to clean up the semantics of
array languages, and I think there’s an interesting unification
between array languages and logic languages waiting to be birthed.</p>
<p>One interesting possibility is being able to decide, separate from the
specification of what is to be computed, that some of the axes of the
arrays in question should be materialized in time rather than in
space.</p>
<h3>Arrays and constraints</h3>
<p>One of the most common uses for libraries and languages like these is
in solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, which is the
simplest kind of constraint satisfaction and often occurs as part of a
larger constraint system (for example, a linear network within a
circuit containing nonlinear elements); in Numpy, for example, to
solve Ax = b for x, where A is a matrix and b is a vector, you use
<code>numpy.linalg.solve(A, b)</code>.  Scipy, a library built on Numpy, has a
sparse-matrices package that can be deployed in the service of solving
much larger sparse linear systems.</p>
<p>XXX explain here about logic and array languages</p>
<h3>Arrays and optimization</h3>
<p>One advantage of array formulations of optimization problems is that
automatic differentiation — which numerically computes a derivative or
gradient together with the output of a calculation — is easily added
to an array library like those mentioned, and indeed TensorFlow and I
think Theano provide this functionality natively.</p>
<h3>Arrays and logic</h3>
<p>Iverson got a Turing Award for inventing APL, and his lecture was
entitled <em>Notation as a Tool of Thought</em>.  He argued that APL was a
more formally tractable notation for programs, to which we could more
easily apply the principles of symbolic reasoning and manipulation.
Certainly programs in APL and related languages are compact, which is
a major advantage for symbolic manipulation by hand; could it
similarly make formal manipulation more tractable?</p>
<h3>Arrays and intervals</h3>
<p>I don’t think there is any particular synergy between arrays and
intervals.</p>
<h2>Physical system simulation</h2>
<p>From the beginning, one of the most important uses for computers has
been the numerical simulation of physical systems — whether wing
flutter in Germany with Zuse’s Z-3, artillery trajectories and H-bomb
explosions with the ENIAC, the car-crash simulations that were the
public rationale for the Tera MTA, or the optical systems that modern
GPUs were developed to simulate.</p>
<p>I am just beginning to learn about finite element analysis, which is
the most broadly applied method for physical system simulation.</p>
<h3>Simulation and constraints</h3>
<p>To the extent that you can formulate a simulation in a
constraint-satisfaction-system-tractable fashion, you can use the
constraint-satisfaction system to design a physical system that
satisfies your constraints.  But this is more useful in the context of
optimization.</p>
<h3>Simulation and optimization</h3>
<p>The most famous results along these lines are topology optimization,
which has been used to optimize stiffness, heat transfer, and so on,
but which seems to me to still be in its infancy despite a third of a
century of development.  Still almost nobody is optimizing elastic
bodies for specific stress-strain curves, for example, or searching
for toolpaths that minimize the heat-affected zone around a kerf.</p>
<h3>Simulation and logic</h3>
<p>I dunno, I got nothing.</p>
<h3>Simulation and intervals</h3>
<p>One of the hairy problems with finite element simulation is that it’s
conducted on a discretized approximation of the actual physical
system, not the continuous system itself.  The discretization
introduces errors into the simulation results, but how do you find out
if those errors are big enough to be significant?  You can use a finer
discretization and see if the results changed much.  If they do, you
need to go finer.  But if they don’t, you don’t know if you’re just on
a plateau and an even finer resolution would give you a big change, or
not.  I’m told this is an especially big problem with fluid dynamics,
due to “vorticity, cavitation, backflow, all sorts of wonderful
nonlinear effects” (@sigfig).</p>
<p>There has been work on bounding these errors using conservative error
approximation techniques, but I don’t know about them.  The
straightforward application of interval arithmetic is not enough.</p>
<p>To the point that it’s feasible to bound these errors, it should be
possible to speed up preliminary simulations enormously by only
simulating them to very loose tolerances.  This should speed up
optimization through simulation greatly.</p>
<h3>Simulation and arrays</h3>
<p>Everybody uses arrays for numerical simulations.  It’s, like, what
they’re best at.</p>
<h2>Automated manufacturing or digital fabrication</h2>
<p>Fabrication is the making of physical objects.  Digital fabrication is
making them from a design in a computer; the most commonplace example
is printing out a page on a printer, but it also includes things like
integrated circuit fabrication and CNC milling.  There’s been a lot of
excitement around 3-D printing (aka additive manufacturing) in the
last few years, but that’s only one kind of digital fabrication.</p>
<p>I think digital fabrication is poised to explode over the next few
years for a variety of reasons: better sensors (producing better
feedback), better design tools (including simulation), and the
RepRap-derived community, including things like Thingiverse and
OpenSCAD.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing and constraints</h3>
<p>Much of robotics has to do with finding a feasible plan for achieving
an objective under known constraints.  Toolpath planning for CNC is
one example; a bad toolpath can do things like drive a cutting tool
hard against a part of a workpiece it was not supposed to contact.</p>
<p>Even without robotics, of course, things like nesting for panel
cutting are constraint problems.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing and optimization</h3>
<p>In those cases, often some plans are much better than others.  A
manual panel-cutting plan that requires you to reset the fence on the
panel saw three times is better than one that requires you to set it
twelve times, unless it results in using three sheets of plywood where
one would do.  A toolpath can take more or less time and spend more or
less time far from the optimal feed rate.</p>
<p>We often break down design problems into parts separated by
abstraction layers in order to make each part tractable on its own.
Indeed, this is one of the major forces driving additive manufacturing
in industry in the last few years — it allows you to fabricate a much
wider range of shapes, increasing the freedom of the design stage.
But it seems likely that mathematical optimization should be able to
optimize across many such stages at once, and this is likely to
provide one or more orders of magnitude improvement in cost/benefit
ratio.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing and logic</h3>
<p>I dunno.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing and intervals</h3>
<p>Likewise.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing and arrays</h3>
<p>Likewise.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing and simulation</h3>
<p>Simulation enables optimization in manufacturing.  It also makes it
possible to reduce the number of prototypes enormously, conceivably
eliminating the necessity for mass production entirely.</p>
<h2>Self-sustaining software systems</h2>
<p>Self-sustaining systems are those that can compile themselves from
source code.  PyPy, Squeak, Oberon, and metacompiled Forth are my
usual examples.</p>
<p>I’m interested in self-sustaining systems for a few different reasons.</p>
<p>XXX movethislater</p>
<h2>Incremental computation and caching</h2>
<p>Incremental computation is adjusting the output of a computation to
reflect a change in its input in some way that is cheaper than simply
recomputing the output from the changed input.  A large fraction of
our existing software infrastructure is occupied with incremental
computation, because it’s common to get several orders of magnitude
performance improvement from it.</p>
<p>Caching or memoization is one strategy for incremental computation;
this works by breaking a computation into deterministic parts with
identifiable inputs in a way such that some of the computations have
no change to their inputs, and therefore are guaranteed to have the
same output as before; then you simply reuse the previously computed
result for that part of the computation, thus limiting the work only
to part whose input has changed.</p>
<p>Examples include executable files (cached compiler output), font
bitmaps (cached font rasterizer output), window contents backing store
(cached paint output), the DOM (arguably, cached parser output), any
in-memory data structure computed from the contents of a file, and any
number of lower-level pieces of information in your code — basically
almost anything for which you write a function with the word “update”
in its name.</p>
<p>This is a very broad topic, including perhaps the majority of software
in existence, because it’s common for caching of the results of
computations to convert exponential-time algorithms to linear-time or
even constant-time algorithms, or to knock off four or more orders of
magnitude from constant factors.  A unified system for caching that
was capable of doing a reasonable job at solving these problems could
increase the power per line of code of software enormously.</p>
<p>(It’s commonly said that the only two hard problems in software are
naming things and caching (or cache invalidation).)</p>
<p>The few interesting projects on this front are Apache Spark, redo, and
Self-Adjusting Computation.</p>
<p>Caching isn’t the only way to do incremental computation.  It’s also
possible, though less common, to compute a new output from the old
output and some kind of description of the change.  This is typically
the approach taken with RDBMS indices — when an indexed value is
updated in the underlying table, rather than recomputing the index or
part of the index from the new table contents, the database adds a new
index entry and deletes or invalidates the old one.  This kind of
incrementalization requires the processing being incrementalized to
preserve some kind of homomorphism between the input and output such
that the change to the output can be computed from the change to the
input.</p>
<h3>Incrementality and constraints</h3>
<p>There are some incremental constraint systems, which can propagate an
incremental change to constraints more efficiently than recomputing a
constraint from scratch.  Constraint systems implemented by
optimization will typically have this property by default.
Combinatorial search (for constraints over finite domains) also likely
benefits from reusing parts or most of a previously-valid solution.</p>
<p>The other angle on this would be using a constraint system to make a
computation incremental.  This might work but I’m not sure how.</p>
<h3>Incrementality and optimization</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, optimization systems that work by iterative
approximation will tend to have incremental properties — a small
change in the objective function or the constraints will get a big
performance boost from having an existing approximately-correct
solution.</p>
<p>The other angle on this would be using a mathematical optimization
system to carry out general incremental computation.  In particular,
caching systems face difficult choices about which cached computations
to throw away and which to keep; space is always finite, relevant
information about what to keep is always incomplete, and good choices
can speed things up by many orders of magnitude overbad choices.</p>
<h3>Incrementality and logic</h3>
<p>Tabled resolution is the standard way to cache logical conclusions in
Prolog-derived logic-programming systems.  I don’t know anything about
it.</p>
<p>In more general theorem-proving systems, which I also don’t know
anything about, I have the impression that tactic choice and proofs
can be reused from one run to the next of the proof assistant, saving
the time of expensive searches; as with combinatorial search in
constraint systems, this should be a huge win.</p>
<p>Using theorem-provers to support strategies for incremental
recomputation also seems feasible, both in informing cache eviction
strategies (if you can prove that something will be used again in the
near future, it may be a poor choice to evict from cache) and in
proving that an incrementalization strategy doesn’t introduce bugs.
This seems necessary if homomorphism-based incrementalization (as
opposed to caching) is to be correct, and would be sufficient to
introduce it automatically where applicable.</p>
<h3>Incrementality and intervals</h3>
<p>One of the more interesting ideas in Flórez Díaz’s dissertation is
that interval arithmetic can avoid computation and thus dramatically
accelerate ray-tracing, especially of animations.  If you determine
that for 0≤<em>x</em>≤0.1, 0.2≤<em>y</em>≤0.3, 0≤<em>t</em>≤5, some conditional yields false,
then you don’t have to recompute anything in that x-y area guarded by
that conditional when <em>t</em> increases from 1 to 2.</p>
<p>Applying this idea more generally, it may be possible in some cases to
compute a description of how <em>much</em> some input would have to change in
order to change an output.</p>
<p>And, of course, the recursive refinement algorithm I described earlier
for using interval arithmetic to solve optimization and constraint
problems could in theory benefit enormously from incrementalization,
since each subdivision of the problem space changes only one input
from the previous iteration.</p>
<h3>Incrementality and array languages</h3>
<p>Incremental recomputation of arrays or parts of arrays seems like an
interesting idea.  The array language K implements some version of it.
Some relevant considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Array languages expose many computations to the runtime at a higher
  level than other languages, which could potentially make it more
  feasible to do even homomorphism-based incrementalization
  automatically.  The dependencies between values in different arrays
  are generally more regular than the dependencies generated by
  arbitrary code, so it should be feasible to keep more of them
  around.</p>
</li>

<p>If the unit of caching and recomputation is individual elements
  rather than entire arrays, tracking valid/invalid bits for large
  arrays should be much cheaper than tracking them for numerous random
  small objects.</p>

<h3>Incrementality and simulation</h3>
<p>Incrementalizing simulation of physical systems would be super
awesome; if you could get a 1000× speedup on second and subsequent
simulations of slight variations of a design by reusing data computed
in the first iteration, you could try 1000× as many variations.
Straightforward caching won’t get you there, because typically any
change to any part of the system design immediately reverberates
through the system, creating tiny, possibly insignificant changes
everywhere.  I think this might be possible, on the other hand, under
some circumstances, with the interval-arithmetic ideas I mentioned
earlier — you may not care to find the precise stiffness of each
design, for example, but only to optimize the stiffness by finding the
stiffest variant.</p>
<h3>Incrementality and manufacturing</h3>
<p>I don’t think I have anything to say here that isn’t said above.</p>
<h3>Incrementality and self-sustaining systems</h3>
<p>A coherent incremental recomputation system may be a key to getting a
self-sustaining system down to a reasonable size.</p>

<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
<p>Reproducibility is the foundation of science.  Science is what can be
demonstrated.  Irreproducible results cannot be demonstrated; you must
take it on faith that the person reporting them is reporting them
accurately, and so there is no tendency toward self-correction over
time.</p>
<p>We have a limited kind of reproducibility with our current software;
often enough, you can download a piece of software, possibly recompile
it with current libraries, and have it work on your computer.  But
often this requires some work to get it running, and even if it
appears to work, you don’t know if it works the same way it worked on
other people’s computers in the past.  So if they reported some
results with it, and you get conflicting results, you don’t know why
that is.</p>
<p>Nix and Guix are efforts to make software more reproducible by nailing
down all its dependencies, and they enhance the reproducibility
situation significantly.  However, the bootstrap kernel for either of
them is fairly large, and they rely on unreliable third-party websites
to host the tarballs of the dependencies, with the result that this
reproducibility still has big holes in it.</p>
<p>I think we can do considerably better, keeping the initial bootstrap
kernel very small indeed — small enough that it can be reimplemented
from scratch on a new platform in a few hours.</p>
<h3>Reproducibility and constraints</h3>
<p>Constraint-solving systems are inherently nondeterministic in a way
that imperative systems are not; the solutions they find, and indeed
whether they find a solution at all even when one exists, may vary
depending on details of their search strategies.  This potentially
poses problems for reproducibility, since the effects of changes may
be hard to track.</p>
<p>For a weak form of reproducibility, this is not a problem, since we
can compile a theoretically nondeterministic constraint-solving system
into a deterministic imperative form before using it.  But a stronger
form of reproducibility, in which we can reason about what effects
will be produced by a given change, will be frustrated by it, because
the effects of altering constraint-solving things will be mostly by
virtue of changing which of many possible acceptable solutions will be
found first.</p>
<h3>Reproducibility and optimization</h3>
<p>Optimization is even more sensitively dependent on random nonsense and
thus that much more difficult to achieve reproducibility in.  Worse,
being able to take advantage of things learned during previous
optimization sessions may be really crucial to making
optimization-based computation feasible, in a way that it isn’t for
traditional programming paradigms.  To some extent, it may be possible
to paper over this using caching approaches to incrementalization.</p>
<p>However, to the extent that optimization can be used as a way</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
