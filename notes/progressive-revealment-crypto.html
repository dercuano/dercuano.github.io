(2 minutes)</div><p>If I encrypt a document with a symmetric key to which I give you all
but the last 40 bits, and the decrypted document contains a way to
verify that it’s the correct decrypted document (lower entropy, say,
or a checksum), then you can decrypt it in about 2³⁹ work.  If this
document contains all but the last 40 bits of the encryption key to
another document, then once you've decrypted it, you can decrypt the
second document in about another 2³⁹ operations, or 2⁴⁰ operations in
total.  Such a chain of documents forms a sort of “time lock crypto”;
it is difficult and perhaps infeasible to decrypt the documents
further down the chain without first decrypting the earlier documents.</p>
<p>It’s not a very good timelock, in that I (the puzzle-maker) must
encrypt the documents serially as well, and my only advantage over you
(the puzzle-solver) is that I only had to encrypt each document once,
while you had to decrypt it 2³⁹ times.  But those decryptions can be
carried out in parallel; in the limit of unbounded parallelism,
decryption is as fast as encryption plus a bit of communication
overhead.</p>
<p>But, in the case where the puzzle-solver has limited parallelism, the
puzzle can be made arbitrarily hard.  Suppose, for example, that the
puzzle-solver only has a million-node cluster available to try keys
with, each node being as powerful as my laptop.  Then, using the
40-bit example above, a chain of documents that I needed one day to
encrypt on my laptop will take them a million days — 3000 years — to
decrypt.</p>
<p>The downside of this is that, if they are decrypting it on their
laptop instead of a million-node cluster, they will need 3 billion
years instead.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/archival.html">Archival</a> (34 notes)
