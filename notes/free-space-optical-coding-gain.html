(4 minutes)</div><p>I was thinking about Wi-Fi and infrared remote controls for TVs and
air conditioners today.  (Did you know there used to be infrared
802.11 access points too?)  Remotes don’t work if you don’t point them
at the air conditioner (or TV or whatever), although the infrared
light they emit is pretty bright, as bright as a bright flashlight.
But it’s modulated at a barely ultrasonic frequency; the first TV
remote controls were in fact ultrasonic chimes pinged with a hammer,
and bizarrely manufacturers have continued using the same frequencies
despite using a completely different medium.</p>
<h2>A remote-control receiver receives about -54 dBm of signal</h2>
<p>I’m not totally sure, but I’m guessing that these remotes use infrared
LEDs with a forward drop of about 1.5 volts, a current of about 40 mA,
and an efficiency on the order of 4%.  (Typical LEDs have a luminous
coefficient around 3%, although modern illumination white LEDs can
reach 25%, but I’m assuming that these advances haven’t translated to
the infrared LEDs used in remotes.)  That would work out to 2.4 mW of
light energy, or +3.8 dBm, which is then emitted with an “antenna
gain” of about 6 dBi (thus EIRP ≈ 6.2 dBm) spread over a sphere of
perhaps two meters radius (50 m² of surface) and detected by a
phototransistor of radius perhaps 8 mm (5e-5 m²), so the received
signal should be about 60 dB below the EIRP, or about -54 dBm.</p>
<h2>But Wi-Fi works with orders of magnitude less than that</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi often achieves sustained, consistent data transmission despite
signal levels below -70 dBm, sometimes below -100 dBm.  GPS receivers
detect even weaker signals.</p>
<h2>What does the optical environment look like for that kind of thing?</h2>
<p>What if you used the spread-spectrum coding-gain approach used by GPS
receivers and Wi-Fi receivers, but for local optical communication?
You can easily modulate ordinary LEDs at over a megahertz, and now
that CRT TVs are dying out, I think there aren’t many sources of
megahertz-range optical noise in households.  Common illumination and
taillight LEDs are typically pulsed, but only on the order of 100 Hz,
in order to reduce switching losses; I think their 10,000th harmonic
is going to be very weak, precisely because of those switching losses
(aside from having a very low duty cycle even if the switching were
perfect).</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> still the problem that direct sunlight is 100 kilolux, and
even indoor room lighting is 50–500 lux, while the light you’re able
to transmit from an infrared LED is also only about 100 lux a few
dozen millimeters in front of the LED, maybe 1 lux or less at the
sensor.  Even if the infrared light coming in an open window is
effectively constant over microsecond-scale time periods, it still
gives rise to shot noise at your infrared sensor.  We usually think of
shot noise as going away as signal levels rise, but actually it
increases; it’s just that it increases proportional to only the square
root of the signal, so the signal increases even more.  But in this
case the sunlight “signal” carries no information, and an increase in
shot noise proportional to its square root could eventually swamp the
information-carrying signal.</p>
<p>In the 1000-ms response time of a conventional remote control, you
could transmit literally a million bits, giving you the possibility of
up to 60 dB of coding gain.  (I think?  I’m kind of guessing about the
limits of coding gain here.  I should go back and really understand
information theory.)</p>
<p>The key problem with light is that it is easily blocked, and even when
multipath transmission can get it around obstacles, it’s heavily
attenuated.  But, by the same token, there’s no need to share
bandwidth or avoid interfering with reserved bandwidth.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
