(26 minutes)</div><p>I was thinking about how to implement the grayscale morphological
“erosion” and “dilation” operations efficiently with a large irregular
structuring element, and I think I’ve found some interesting algorithms;
they may be novel.</p>
<p>In the contex of sampled grayscale images, erosion I ⊖ k maps each
pixel in the image I to the minimum of some neighborhood k around that
pixel, the neighborhood being the “structuring element”, which I will
call a “kernel” for brevity.  (Dilation ⊕ is a similar operation with
some differences that I won’t mention.)</p>
<h2>The naïve approach</h2>
<p>The naïve approach to computing this gets slower with large kernels.
Consider computing, in one dimension, a kernel that consists of the
hotspot pixel and <em>n</em>-1 pixels to the right:</p>
<pre><code>for (int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++) {
    out[x] = in[x];
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) out[x] = min(in[(x+i) % w], out[x]);
)
</code></pre>
<p>This takes time per pixel proportional to <em>n</em>.</p>
<h2>Sliding-window minimum in linear time</h2>
<p>In one dimension, there’s a <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/sliding-window-minimum-maximum-algorithm">well-known linear-time algorithm</a> for this
“sliding-window minimum” or
“sliding range minimum query” problem, using a deque d containing a
nondecreasing subsequence of the window such that the leftmost element
in the deque is always the minimum of the window.  Incrementing the
left edge of the window may leave the deque unchanged, or it may
involve dropping the oldest value, if that value falls out of the
window; then the next value must be the minimum of the remaining
pixels in the window.  Achieving this merely requires that, when we
increment the right edge of the window, we remove any elements in the
deque that are larger than the new pixel, and then append that new
pixel.  This results in the pixels in the deque being in nondecreasing
order, which means that any possible larger pixels will be in a block
at the end of the deque, so we can remove them by popping from its
end.</p>
<p>This sounds trickier than it is.  In pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>d = deque()
for x in range(len(inpix)):
    while d and inpix[d[-1]] &gt; inpix[x]:
        d.pop()
    d.append(x)
    if x - d[0] == n:
        d.popleft()
    yield inpix[d[0]]
</code></pre>
<p>Each pixel is pushed onto the deque exactly once and removed from it
exactly once, at either the left or right, and each pixel comparison
either results in pushing a pixel or popping one, so there can’t be
more than two comparisons per pixel overall.  So the algorithm is
linear-time despite its nested-loop appearance.</p>
<p>This depends on the assumption that the deque operations are
constant-time operations, which is easy to guarantee even in the worst
case if we have a bound on the deque size, which we do; it can’t be
larger than <em>n</em>.  So we can render this into C with variable-length
arrays as follows (see
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/erosion1d.c">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/erosion1d.c</a>):</p>
<pre><code>unsigned d[n], di = 0, dj = 0;
for (int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++) {
  while (di != dj &amp;&amp; in[d[(dj-1) % n]] &gt; in[x]) dj--;
  d[dj++ % n] = x;
  if (x - d[di % n] == n) di++;
  out[x] = in[d[di % n]];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Despite the divisions in the inner loop, for one-byte pixels, this
takes 45–65 nanoseconds per pixel on my laptop with window widths
ranging from 1 to 10000, although it <em>is</em> a bit quicker with one-pixel
windows.  (You could probably run it a lot faster without the
divisions.)</p>
<p>This algorithm clearly has worse constant factors than the naïve
algorithm, so the naïve algorithm is probably faster for sufficiently
small kernels, but I haven’t optimized and measured to see exactly how
big the kernel needs to be for this algorithm to be faster.  I’m
pretty sure the naïve algorithm is going to be faster for 3-pixel-wide
kernels.</p>
<p>I think this algorithm may be <a href="http://richardhartersworld.com/cri/2001/slidingmin.html">due to Richard Harter in 2001</a>, who
called it “the ascending minima algorithm”, but I’m not sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an interesting side note, a slight variation of this algorithm
computes the convex hull of a series of points in 2-D in linear
time.  It consists of a basic pass which computes the upper convex
hull, which is applied a second time under a suitable transformation
to compute the lower convex hull, which together (perhaps with
vertical lines to join them) form the overall convex hull.  Each
pass iterates over the points in increasing order of X coordinate,
just as the sliding-window algorithm does; the upper convex hull is
accumulated on a stack (rather than a deque) and points are popped
off the stack if, considering the new point being added, they would
make the hull non-convex, rather than if they are greater than the
new point being added.  This maintains the invariant that the
sequence is convex upwards, rather than that it is nondecreasing.
This is important for efficiently finding affine-arithmetic
approximations of empirical data, as explored in <a href="../notes/affine-database.html">An affine-arithmetic database index for rapid historical securities formula queries</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a completely different algorithm with similar linear
performance published by van Herk in 1992 in a paper entitled, “A fast
algorithm for local minimum and maximum filters on rectangular and
octagonal kernels” and concurrently by Gil and Werman.  It divides the
array into <em>N</em>-sample blocks and computes prefix-sum minima within each
block going both left “h” and right “g”.  Any <em>N</em>-sample window will
include some number <em>x</em> ∈ (0, <em>N</em>] of samples in its leftmost block and
some number <em>N</em> - <em>x</em> ∈ [0, <em>N</em>) of samples in the block to the right; the
minimum of the <em>x</em> samples in the left block can be found in the “h” array
for that block, and the minimum of the <em>N</em> - <em>x</em> samples in the right block
can be found in the “g” array for that block.  The minimum of these
two numbers is the minimum over the whole block.</p>
<h2>Separable kernels</h2>
<p>As with box-filter convolution and Gaussian convolution, we can
decompose erosions with certain two-dimensional kernels into
compositions of two erosions with one-dimensional kernels, one in X
and one in Y, thanks to a sort of distributive law (sometimes called
“the chain rule”):</p>
<pre><code>(I ⊖ k₁) ⊖ k₂ = I ⊖ (k₁ ⊕ k₂)
</code></pre>
<p>This is great, because it means we can erode an image with a paraxial
rectangle of any size and shape in 90–130 nanoseconds per pixel,
because it takes six pixel-minimum operations per pixel.  (This is faster than
just generalizing the van Herk–Gil–Werman algorithm to rectangles, which takes
15 pixel-minimum operations per pixel.)
Great, right?  But it’s a paraxial rectangle.  One could wish for
something more.  For example, many real-world images have features
that are rotationally invariant, so a circle or annulus or something
might be a more interesting kernel.</p>
<p>The distributive law says that eroding with two kernels is the same as
eroding with the dilation of the kernels, which in
this context is just their Minkowski sum.  For example, dilating a
kernel with a kernel that is a line in whatever orientation, that sort
of pulls it apart in the direction of the line, filling in the gap by
adding two straight facets in between, facets of the orientation and
length of the line.  So eroding an already-eroded image with such a
kernel is the same as expanding its erosion kernel in that way.</p>
<p>So if you erode with two kernels that are lines, you get the erosion
of a parallelogram, or in the degenerate case, a longer line.  But so
far we’ve only covered how to erode efficiently with horizontal and
vertical lines.</p>
<p>How about diagonal lines?  The one-dimensional sliding-window minimum
algorithm is just as happy to run along a diagonal of the image pixels
as along a row or column.  If your kernel is literally just a diagonal
line of pixels like [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)], then you
might get some checkerboarding artifacts in the resulting image, but
if you’re also using a horizontal or vertical kernel, those should go
away.</p>
<p>This carries over to skewed-line kernels like [(-4, -2), (-2, -1), (0,
0), (2, 1), (4, 2)] or [(0, 0), (1, 3), (2, 6)].  These have big gaps
in them, so they would be shitty kernels by themselves, but used to
dilate a kernel that fills those gaps on its own, they can give you
not only excellent approximations of circles but also lines and
arbitrarily-oriented capsules.</p>
<p>It turns out this approach to approximating circular kernels was
published by Adams in 1993 in the paper, “Radial decomposition of
discs and spheres”, except for the bit about skewed-line kernels with
gaps in them.</p>
<h2>Bresenham lines</h2>
<p>I was also thinking that you could get a good approximation of a line
kernel by running the one-dimensional algorithm along gap-free
rasterized diagonal lines — essentially running it in the X or Y
direction, but occasionally “jumping the groove” to an adjacent
raster; this will give you a slightly different kernel at each pixel,
but probably the errors are insignificant for most applications.  But
now I think that there is no real advantage to that approach over the
precise approach described earlier.</p>
<p>It turns out that Soille, Breen, and Jones published essentially this
algorithm in 1996 in their paper, “Recursive implementation of
erosions and dilations along discrete lines at arbitrary angles”, but
using the van Herk/Gil–Werman one-dimensional sliding-window minimum
algorithm.  They note this approximation drawback:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…it is important to note that the shape of the SE [kernel] may vary
slightly from one pixel to another.  Indeed, except for horizontal,
vertical, and diagonal directions, a discrete line in the square
grid contains 4- as well as 8-connected pixels.  Hence, when the SE
of length <em>k</em> moves along such a discrete line, its shape varies
accordingly to its position along the line.  In practice, this is
not a major drawback provided that the angle specified is actually
defined in the neighborhood corresponding to the extent of the SE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then they go on to define a “translation-invariant implementation”
that avoids this non-major drawback, which has a great deal in common
with what I’ve described above but may not be exactly the same; I’m
not sure yet.  It does seem to work better for their
radial-decomposition purpose.</p>
<p>Also they point out a use of this algorithm to detect linear features
by combining linear openings at different angles by max, rather than
by composing linear erosions and dilations to get a round kernel.</p>
<h2>Gapped one-dimensional kernels to accelerate the naïve algorithm</h2>
<p>One way to get an erosion with a 9-pixel-wide kernel is to erode with
a 3-pixel-wide kernel four times.  But a better way — aside from the
deque algorithm described previously — is to erode first with the
kernel [-1, 0, 1] and then the kernel [-3, 0, 3]; and, to get only a
7-pixel kernel, you could erode with [-1, 0, 1] and then [-2, 0, 2].
If you want a 27-pixel-wide kernel, you can do [-1, 0, 1] ∘ [-3, 0, 3]
∘ [-9, 0, 9], and by reducing the width of this last kernel, you can
get any number less than 27, too.  (Though, see below (‡) for why
using kernels with two pixels is better than using kernels with
three.)</p>
<p>This points out a log-linear-time algorithm to erode with large
kernels (linear in the image, logarithmic in the kernel) in a single
dimension, which, unlike the deque algorithm, is easy to parallelize
and incrementalize.  For example, this algorithm can be
straightforwardly applied to several scan lines in parallel using
vector instructions, while the deque algorithm can’t.  (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/content/GTC/posters/14_Domanski_Parallel_vanHerk.pdf">The
van Herk/Gil–Werman algorithm can, though.</a>)</p>
<p>(And of course it applies to sliding-window-minimum-type problems in
non-image-processing contexts, as well.)</p>
<p>This implementation of the algorithm takes 16 nanoseconds per byte to
compute a 50-byte erosion on a 10-million-byte input without paying
proper attention to the boundary conditions:</p>
<pre><code>static inline char cmin(char a, char b) { return (a &lt; b) ? a : b; }
int x;
for (x = 0; x &lt; w- 3; x++) out[x] = cmin(in[x],  cmin( in[x+1],  in[x+ 2]));
for (x = 0; x &lt; w- 9; x++) out[x] = cmin(out[x], cmin(out[x+3], out[x+ 6]));
for (x = 0; x &lt; w-27; x++) out[x] = cmin(out[x], cmin(out[x+9], out[x+18]));
for (x = 0; x &lt; w-50; x++) out[x] = cmin(out[x], out[x+23]);
</code></pre>
<p>This is about four times as fast as my implementation of the deque
algorithm above, although probably that’s just because of the three
divisions in its inner loop.</p>
<p>But you can pipeline this algorithm into requiring only a single pass
over the input:</p>
<pre><code>for (x = 0; x &lt; w-50; x++) {
  out[x+23+18+6] = cmin(in[x+23+18+6], cmin(in[x+23+18+6+1], in[x+23+18+6+2]));
  out[x+23+18] = cmin(out[x+23+18], cmin(out[x+23+18+3], out[x+23+18+6]));
  out[x+23] = cmin(out[x+23], cmin(out[x+23+9], out[x+23+18]));
  out[x] = cmin(out[x], out[x+23]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>For some reason, this version runs at the same speed as the many-pass
version, even over the same 10-million-byte input.</p>
<h2>Union kernels</h2>
<p>This can be generalized!  And, not surprisingly, someone already has.</p>
<p>I ⊖ (k₁ ∪ k₂), the erosion by a union, is the same as (I ⊖ k₁) ∧ (I ⊖
k₂), where ∧ is the pixelwise minimum operation.  Urbach and Wilkinson
published an algorithm in 2008 (doi 10.1.1.442.4549) that decomposes an arbitrary kernel
(“flat”, they say, meaning that — as in all of my discussion
above — the kernel contains only full and empty pixels, no shades of
gray) into scan lines (“chords”).</p>
<p>Urbach and Wilkinson use the fact that the erosion by a kernel
consisting of N consecutive 1s on a single scan line, composed with
erosion by a kernel consisting of two 1s on a single scan line at
(possibly non-consecutive) positions 0 and M (the kernel [0, M] in the
notation I used above), computes the erosion by a kernel of N+M
consecutive 1s.  This is a special case of the distributive law
mentioned earlier, that (A ⊖ B) ⊖ C = A ⊖ (B ⊕ C) — the N+M
consecutive 1s are the dilation of the N consecutive 1s and the two 1s
at positions 0 and M.  So Urbach and Wilkinson use this to compute the
erosions of the image by “chord” kernels of lengths 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, …
with one comparison operation per pixel per binary chord length.
Given these, they can compute the erosion of the image by any
arbitrary chord length by taking one of those images and eroding it by
another two-separated-pixel kernel in, again, one comparison operation
per pixel; for example, to get erosion by an 11-pixel chord, you erode
the 8-pixel-chord-eroded image with the kernel 1 0 0 0 0 1, that is,
with pixels in positions 0 and 5.</p>
<p>A union of such chord kernels can thus compute the erosion by an
arbitrary flat kernel with two comparison operations per pixel per
chord of the kernel, once results for enough chord kernels of powers
of 2 have been computed.</p>
<p>This algorithm is claimed to be considerably
faster than the others I mentioned above, and now that I understand it,
I believe it.</p>
<p>However, I think we can do better.  You can see this as a special case
of (A ⊖ B) ⊖ C = A ⊖ (B ⊕ C), but you can also see it as a special
case of I ⊖ (k₁ ∪ k₂) = (I ⊖ k₁) ∧ (I ⊖ k₂), where (except in the last
step, where different scan lines are brought together) the two kernels
are always the same kernel with different pixel shifts.  (We can
probably assume that the pixel shifts are free until the kernel gets
large compared to the image size.)  So the generalized problem is to
minimize the cost of a DAG where the nodes are of the form (I₀ shifted
(<em>x</em>₀, <em>y</em>₀)) <em>op</em> (I₁ shifted (<em>x</em>₁, <em>y</em>₁)), where <em>op</em> is either ∨
or ∧, to build up the kernel we want, starting with only the identity
kernel, then taking unions and intersections of (shifted) existing
kernels.</p>
<p>In some cases it is clear that there are better alternative
strategies; for example, with a vertically symmetric kernel like a
circle, you can compute each chord length once instead of twice, and
if there are <em>N</em> adjacent scan lines with the same chord, you can use
⌈lg <em>N</em>⌉ comparisons to compute that block rather than <em>N</em>-1.  Urbach
and Wilkinson’s paper also gives an H-shaped example kernel of 49×49
pixels, consisting of three overlapping 1×49 pixel lines (one
horizontal and two vertical), which also clearly has a much simpler
decomposition: a 49-pixel vertical line, unioned with itself shifted
48 pixels to the right, and a horizontal line of between 47 and 49
pixels.  This H could be decomposed into horizontal chords of 2, 4, 8,
16, 32, and 47 pixels, vertical chords of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 49
pixels, and two more (shifted) pixelwise minimum operations to combine
the three; this requires 14 pixelwise minimum operations rather than
the 54 they implicitly report in their paper.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> it is the case that I ⊖ (k₁ ∩ k₂) = (I ⊖ k₁) ∨ (I ⊖ k₂),
thus allowing us to intersect erosion kernels as well as take their
union — but I’m not sure right now, because that would seem to suggest
that if you intersect the identity kernel with a shifted version of
itself, you get a well-defined dilation rather than an ill-defined
erosion with an empty set; I’m not sure this doesn’t suggest that
sometimes you’ll get a dilation or a combination of dilation and
erosion in less pathological cases.</p>
<p>If we exclude intersections and have only unions, then there is a
computable algorithm for finding the optimum DAG: exhaustive search of
all the possible ways to compute all kernels that could fit into our
desired kernel somewhere.  I think we can use A* search to get a
better, perhaps even computationally tractable, strategy for finding
the optimum DAG.  Failing that, a heuristic optimization algorithm
that starts with the feasible Urbach–Wilkinson strategy and attempts
to improve it is a reasonable approach.</p>
<p>Many of these search algorithms could probably be sped up with a
precomputed database of all the possible DAG nodes accessible in, say,
four or five pixelwise minimum operations, if limited to some sort of
reasonable shift radius.</p>
<p>My suggestion (‡) in an earlier section that making a pipeline out of
erosion operations would be most efficient when each kernel in the
pipeline had three pixels active was ill-founded; in fact the optimum
is two, because you find the minimum of two pixels in one operation,
not two.</p>
<h2>Urbach–Wilkinson with an ascending minima stack</h2>
<p>The Urbach–Wilkinson algorithm computes one eroded image for each
distinct horizontal chord length in time logarithmic in the maximum
chord length and linear in the number of chord lengths, then combines
these horizontally-eroded images with vertical and horizontal offsets
to get the final result.  Above I point out that there are sometimes
more efficient ways to combine the horizontally-eroded images that
require less than the one operation per chord Urbach–Wilkinson give.
Also, though, we can compute those horizontally-eroded images in a
more efficient manner than Urbach and Wilkinson’s algorithm when we
have a small number of chord lengths — by using the ascending-minima
algorithm.</p>
<p>As an extreme case, consider using Urbach–Wilkinson to erode by a
paraxial square 65×65 kernel.  Each final image pixel is the minimum
of 65 vertically-adjacent pixels in a single intermediate image that
is eroded by a 65-pixel horizontal-line kernel; to compute this
intermediate image, the UW algorithm first computes the erosions by
horizontal-line kernels of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 pixels, requiring 6
min operations per pixel.  A seventh min operation per pixel gives the
65-pixel erosion we needed.  (This doesn’t require nearly as much
memory traffic as you might think, because you can pipeline it just as
you can some of the algorithms discussed earlier, or as in <a href="../notes/dsp-pipeline.html">Evaluating DSP operations in minimal buffer space by pipelining</a>.)</p>
<p>By contrast, the ascending-minima algorithm does 2 pixel-min
operations per pixel, plus some pointer comparisons, to achieve this
or any other single-window-width sliding-window erosion.</p>
<p>You might think that the ascending-minima algorithm would require a
separate deque for multiple window widths.  But consider what happens
if we implement the deque as a stack of all nondecreasing pixels on
the line, with a “bottom pointer” that we sometimes increment and
never decrement.  When we push a new pixel onto the stack, we need to
check to see if the bottom pointer must be incremented because its
pixel has aged out; when we pop pixels from the stack in order to push
a smaller pixel, we need to ensure that the bottom pointer points to
the newly pushed pixel or something to its left.</p>
<p>But the actual contents of the stack do not depend on the bottom
pointer, and the bottom pointer is the only thing that depends on the
window width.  So many bottom pointers can share the same pixel stack.
And so adding more bottom pointers doesn’t add more pixel comparisons;
those remain at 2 per pixel, regardless of the number of chord lengths
demanded.  The extra bottom pointers do, however, add more index
comparisons, which are about 2 per chord length per pixel.</p>
<p>Conceivably in practice the extra log-N factor is too small to matter.</p>
<p>Of course this whole technique to get an arbitrary number of sliding
windows out of a single ascending-minima stack is applicable to other
applications of sliding-window RMQ, not just image erosion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could try to make a sort of “spaghetti stack” out of this
approach by making a note under each pixel of the pixel index at which
it gets popped off the stack and of the index of the pixel under it on
the stack, but in this simple form, this modification doesn’t buy you
anything useful — computing a sliding-window RMQ is already as fast as
it’s going to get, and it doesn’t make it fast to compute a
random-access RMQ, because the “stack” isn’t random-access — you have
to chase the pointers up it, and you can’t traverse it downwards at
all except by linearly searching all the pixels.  If you additionally
note the replacement of each pixel (if any) when you pop it, a sort of
next-child pointer, it becomes possible to traverse the tree downwards
in a useful way, but you still have no guarantee of the kind of
balance or random access among children that would make this
efficient — if the pixels happen to be in descending order, the root
will have them all as its children.</p>
<p>You could maybe do some kind of skip-list or tree-balancing thing,
but this avenue of investigation seems progressively less appealing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Linear convolution</h2>
<p>You can use the Urbach–Wilkinson decomposition into “chords” to
accelerate the usual kind of convolution, too, the kind where you take
a weighted sum of the selected neighborhood pixels instead of their
maximum or minimum.  See <a href="../notes/convolution-bokeh.html">Real-time bokeh algorithms, and other convolution tricks</a> for details.  (It
also includes some tricks for decomposing angled lines that can be
used for the morphological operations discussed in this note.)</p>
<h2>Range minimum query</h2>
<p>All of the algorithms mentioned here work by comparing intact pixels
(as opposed to, say, computing histograms of pixel values; there are
somewhat efficient algorithms for general rank-order filtering, which
is a generalization of erosion, dilation, and median-filtering, that
work that way — see <a href="../notes/median-filtering.html">Median filtering</a>).  This means that we can
augment the pixel values being considered with extra metadata.  For
example, we could compute the luminance of each pixel and use that for
the comparisons, but drag the original pixel data along with the
luminance so that the color follows as it should.  Or we could tag the
original pixel coordinates onto the end of the pixel data, thus
solving the range-minimum-query problem generalized to arbitrary
window shapes — when we find the minimum pixel within the erosion
window by these algorithms, it comes with its original coordinates.</p>
<p>See further applications in <a href="../notes/interval-trees-over-sequences.html">Query evaluation with interval-annotated trees over sequences</a>.</p>
<p>The Urbach–Wilkinson algorithm constructs an index data structure of
size O(<em>N</em> lg <em>N</em>) which answers range minimum queries in constant
time.  There is a known RMQ algorithm based on Cartesian trees that
also answers range minimum queries in constant time, but using an
index data structure of size only O(<em>N</em>).  I don’t understand it well
enough yet to compare the two algorithms.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
