(8 minutes)</div><p>Scanning an ultraviolet diode laser over a cheap phosphorescent screen
should give you a very inexpensive, high-resolution,
very-low-refresh-rate display screen.</p>
<p>Projecting an image with a laser suffers from a few problems.  One is
that, if the part of the laser beam that would fit through someone’s
pupil is bright enough, it can be an eye safety hazard.  Another is
that the beam must be scanned very rapidly over the screen in order to
provide the illusion of a stable image, and equipment for scanning the
beam very rapidly is energy-hungry and expensive.</p>
<p>We can solve both of these problems with multiple ultraviolet lasers.</p>
<h2>Eye safety</h2>
<p>Ultraviolet light below about 400nm is blocked by the lens of the eye,
so it will not be focused onto the retina and cause the instant
retinal burns that are the principal danger of visible and especially
infrared lasers.  However, it can cause lens damage if continued over
a period of time, including cataracts.  Below 315nm, it cannot even
penetrate the cornea, so it instead will cause only acute
photokeratitis, which will heal unless it is very severe indeed.</p>
<p>However, in discussing the <em>kinds</em> of damage that can be caused, we
risk losing sight of the <em>quantitative</em> safety factor.  The IEC 60825
maximum permissible exposure for a 355nm ultraviolet laser over the
course of a millisecond is 100 watts/cm², falling to under 1 watt/cm²
if the exposure extends to an entire second, and down to 1 mW/cm² if
the exposure continues for a kilosecond.  By contrast, the MPE for a
visible-light laser is 10 milliwatts if for a millisecond, or 3
milliwatts if for an entire second, converging with the ultraviolet
MPE levels at 1000 seconds.</p>
<p>That means that the safe power levels for brief exposure to
ultraviolet lasers are around 100 times higher than for visible-light
lasers.  This means you can send a great deal more energy to your
screen at a safe power level.  It might be a good idea to wear
UV-blocking goggles and to couple your UV laser with a lower power,
but painfully bright, but not dangerous, red laser, in order to
trigger people’s blink reflex.  1mW should be plenty.</p>
<p>An alternative way to provide eye safety under normal circumstances is
to project the laser onto one side of a screen while you look at the
other side, enclosing the laser, scanning apparatus, and back of the
screen inside a sealed, opaque box.</p>
<p>One unfortunate aspect of this approach, though, is that there aren’t
any laser diodes of shorter wavelengths than 370nm commercially
available yet.
<a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/NewGroupPage9.cfm?ObjectGroup_ID=5400">https://www.thorlabs.com/NewGroupPage9.cfm?ObjectGroup_ID=5400</a>
offers Thor Labs’s new 375nm 70mW ultraviolet laser diode L375P70MLD
for US$4300.</p>
<h2>Refresh rate</h2>
<p>A phosphorescent screen will not only convert a certain fraction of
the laser illumination into light, but also continue to glow over a
long period of time, exponentially decaying.  This acts as a
single-pole low-pass filter on the image signal, attenuating
frequencies faster than the time constant of the phosphor by 3dB per
octave.</p>
<p>Zinc sulfide’s phosphorescence decay time constant is a few seconds to
a few minutes.  (I found some paper claiming 9', but that seems
implausibly long to me from experience with glow-in-the-dark toys).
This means that once a glowing image has been drawn on the zinc
sulfide with the laser beam, it will stay there, gradually fading, for
a few minutes.</p>
<p>This means that you can draw an image on the screen with a laser over
a period of seconds or minutes, and it will continue to be visible.
This means that you can draw a fairly complex image even with a fairly
slow apparatus for scanning the laser beam across the screen.  It also
means that you can’t erase anything: you have to wait for it to fade.</p>
<p>It also means that it takes seconds to minutes for the image to reach
full brightness, but because of the logarithmic brightness perception
of human vision, this is not as much of a problem as you would expect.
(I’m guessing this from my experience with analogue oscilloscopes with
zinc sulfide screens.)</p>
<p>Copper-doped zinc sulfide is by far the most common glow-in-the-dark
material.</p>
<p>It might be worthwhile using a secondary, say, red laser to draw a
smaller amount of graphical information that can be instantly erased.
This will work better if the screen is not sensitive to the wavelength
of the secondary laser.</p>
<h2>Erasing</h2>
<p><a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/79860/why-is-a-laserpointer-able-to-erase-a-glow-in-the-dark-sticker">https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/79860/why-is-a-laserpointer-able-to-erase-a-glow-in-the-dark-sticker</a>
reports that a red laser pointer was able to <em>erase</em> the glow from a
glow-in-the-dark sticker (presumably ZnS:Cu).  There is a video of
this phenomenon at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUteUH7mz0A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUteUH7mz0A</a>, but
the erasure seems temporary.</p>
<h2>Multiple lasers</h2>
<p>Laser diodes themselves are relatively inexpensive; Digi-Key has 1.5mW
infrared lasers at US$5.76 and red 5mW lasers at US$12.52.  But as the
power goes up, cost increases sharply.  Their cheapest 20mW laser is
US$46.07 (green), their cheapest laser over 40mW is a 120mW 405nm
near-ultraviolet unit for US$78.44 (this is the wavelength used by
Blu-Ray players), and the only more powerful laser diode for which
they list a price is an 175mW near-ultraviolet unit for US$452.</p>
<p>Given this price curve, you can probably get not only more visible
light output but also more information on the screen by using several
different laser diodes, each pulsed rather than CW, so that sequential
points on the screen are often drawn by different lasers.  Using two
to six separate lasers will increase the energy throughput of the
laser bottleneck significantly, without affecting the rest of the
system.</p>
<p>Also, laser diodes can be controllably pulsed much more rapidly than
mirrors can scan the beam — MHz in the common case or GHz in
exceptional cases — and you can draw minimally readable letterforms by
interrupting three or four vertical lines:</p>
<pre><code> #  ##  # #  ##  ###  #  # #  #
# # # # ### #  # #  # #### ## #
### ##  ### #### ###  #### # ##
# # # # # # #  # #  # #  # #  #
# # ##  # # #  # ###  #  # #  #
</code></pre>
<p>Given three or four laser beams with a slight angle offset between
them horizontally, you could sweep them vertically with a single
movement of the mirror while pulsing different dash patterns on them
to draw the letters.</p>
<h2>Resolution calculations</h2>
<p>You should be able to do a few megapixels this way, but probably not
much more.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re using a 2m² screen, with the laser 1.5m away, and you
have a 1mRad-divergence beam, which is a pretty normal divergence for
a laser pointer.  Then your spot will be 1.5mm across, so your screen
is only about 1300×1300 “pixels”, for a total of 1.8 megapixels.  If
you can get a better-quality laser spot of 0.5mRad, you can get four
times that, or 7 megapixels.</p>
<p>(The diffraction-limited divergence angle is 2λ/(πw), where λ is the
wavelength and w is the beam-waist radius.  So for a 650nm red laser
to have 1mRad divergence, you need w &gt; 2 · 650nm/(π · .001) ≈ 0.4 mm.
Larger collimating optics can produce smaller divergence, but you
aren’t going to get that beam waist below 0.4mm even if the beam waist
is on the screen.)</p>
<p>However, you may only be able to illuminate a small fraction of these
pixels at a time; even expensive laser-show galvos are rated at under
50kpps, and even in two minutes, 50kpps is only 6 million points.
Simpler scanning apparatus, perhaps driven by scavenged hard disc
voice coils or by paper cone speakers, might only hit 1kpps, and thus
only 120k pixels illuminated per laser.  With multiple lasers and dash
patterns, you could actually paint all of those pixels, a few thousand
per second.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/mechanical.html">Mechanical things</a> (45 notes)
