(2 minutes)</div><p>Transistors, especially FETs, are lovely little devices.  They have
very high energy gain — effectively infinite in the FET case.  They
respond very quickly, and aside from that finite response speed, their
response is historyless, which makes the electronic design and test
problems considerably more tractable.  In particular, circuits that
are linear, noninverting, or non-amplifying are not capable of
universal computation, and the transistor immediately takes care of
all three of those barriers at once.  (I’m fairly sure it’s possible
to imagine nonlinear, inverting, amplifying circuit elements that are
still incapable of universal computation, but I don’t know what they’d
look like.)</p>
<p>Transistors do have a few problems, though.  One is that their
response speed, while good, could still be better; it’s in the
picoseconds range for sizes that are practical to fabricate.  Another
is that the transistors that we know how to fabricate are still
somewhat tricky to fabricate, requiring exotic materials, materials
not found in nature and of very high purity.</p>
<p>Braess’s Paradox gives us a way to convert some kinds of noninverting
nonlinearities into inversion; the well-known construction with
resistors and a Zener diode is an example.  In general, the bridge
topology (used in the Braess circuit) provides a way to materialize a
<em>difference</em> in your circuit, which gives you a way to get inversion
and amplification, in some sense anyway.  A change of 1% in the
voltage across one of the “shores” of the bridge can easily result in
a change of 10,000% in the voltage across the bridging element.</p>
<p>Nonlinear circuit behavior and behavior with memory is actually fairly
universal in real circuit elements; it’s just that normally we
consider it a problem to solve, because especially in analog circuits,
the distortions introduced by nonlinearity are difficult to
characterize and predict.  But, for example, capacitor databooks are
full of information about the capacitors’ deviations from linearity,
which often reach 20% or more despite their best engineering efforts
to remove them.  What if we could take advantage of such everyday
nonlinearities to implement digital logic?</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
