(2 minutes)</div><p>I’d like to do simulation and optimization of optical caustics.  The
basic phenomenon is that caustics can have a very high dynamic range
and project a reasonable distance, and in particular can produce
divergence-limited-brightness lines in the projected image.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the simplest idea is that if you take a single pencil of
a collimated beam impinging on a nearly-flat mirrorlike reflector
surface and look at the pattern it makes on a target — whether an
interface between optical media or a metallic surface — the point
where the pencil lands on the target is a continuous function of its
position on the reflector, and can be computed using Heron’s law of
reflection.  However, the pencil may be deformed to be convergent,
divergent, or both, by the curvature of the reflector at that point.
If it is converged to a point or a line, then there is a singularity
of infinite brightness in the caustic.</p>
<p>The derivative of the point to which the pencil is directed with
respect to the point where it’s reflected may go through zero at these
points, in X, Y, or both.  The product of the two derivatives gives,
in some sense, the size of the spot.</p>
<p>Probably the most sensible thing to do is actually to compute a bunch
of reflected rays from different points, then calculate some kind of
spline joining them.  The area of each square of the spline grid
provides a local brightness, but the grid may fold back on itself
through the aforementioned lines of singularity.  This is close to
<a href="https://medium.com/@evanwallace/rendering-realtime-caustics-in-webgl-2a99a29a0b2c">the approach taken by Evan Wallace</a> in WebGL-Water.</p>
<p>(Of course the bright lines are limited in brightness both by the
divergence of the incident light and diffraction over the focusing
zone.)</p>
