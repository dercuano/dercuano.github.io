(3 minutes)</div><p>Learning Erlang for the first time.  A few notes --- mostly the
language and especially the runtime system are lovely, so to keep
these notes short, I haven't listed the many things I like about them.</p>
<p>The syntax for tuples and records is just too bad.  Maybe the record
syntax was unavoidable, but the tuple syntax is bad.</p>
<p>Selective receive seems like it could lead to deadlock.</p>
<p>It seems like client-server responses ought to be tagged with a
request-ID, not the server's PID.</p>
<p>It's kind of bizarre that the ugly "registered process" mechanism,
which introduces a mutable global namespace into an Erlang node, is
built into the message-sending machinery, but you must build at
user-level the machinery to include your PID in a request if you want
a response and figuring out which of your pending responses
corresponds to which request.</p>
<p>Distributed performance isn't particularly good.  Ping-pong time
between processes in a single OS process is on the order of 12-15us on
my machine, but between processes in different OS processes, it's
about 1000-3000us.</p>
<p>It seems like the system tries to hide a lot of the crucial issues
related to distribution: fault-tolerance, tolerance for partitions,
security.  There's a magic "epmd" process ("Erlang portmapper daemon")
that gets started on a node by the first guy who starts a distributed
Erlang process, and then the other Erlang processes connect to it (on
TCP port 4369 --- what, was 4269 taken?  4369 is 0x1111.) and use it
to figure out how to talk to each other.  Even if another user stars
running Erlang processes later on on the same node, they will use this
same "epmd" for their nameservice.</p>
<p>I used Wireshark to see what they're saying to each other.  None of
the conversations are encrypted, but they all use some ugly binary
protocol that makes them a bit hard to read.  (Not sure why they
bother with a binary protocol if it's going to take on the order of a
millisecond each way to do a simple RPC containing a timestamp
anyway.)  The "epmd" conversations are pretty concise, but the "RPC"
conversation between the two Erlang processes is a bit more verbose.</p>
<p>Apparently there's some kind of shared-secret authentication involved
as well...</p>
<p>It seems like it would be better to just layer on top of some other
system for actually making, authenticating, and encrypting the
connections in the first place --- ssh, named pipes in the filesystem,
HTTPS, or whatever.</p>
<p>There also doesn't seem to be any documentation for the security
properties of binary_to_term/1.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
