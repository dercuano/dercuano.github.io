(11 minutes)</div><p>I’ve been thinking again about Darius Bacon’s Sniki and the space of
CRUD webapp development, which people still seem to be mostly doing
using Django, Rails, and similar 2005-vintage designs, despite the
popularity of schemaless and schema-lite database systems like
MongoDB and Redis.</p>
<h2>“Sniki”?</h2>
<p>A few years back, Darius Bacon wrote an interesting “Semantic Network
Wiki” supporting RDF-like triples, called
<a href="https://github.com/darius/sniki">Sniki</a>.  It explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is basically like a wiki only with typed links. Any page can
serve as a link type. Each page lists all the links it's involved
in, as source, type, or target. You edit the links in a separate
text area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was really a free-form database.  On any page, you could include a
set of property-value pairs, using square brackets to enclose
multi-word items:</p>
<pre><code>written 2019-03-11
updated 2019-07-05
concerns politics
supersedes [Taxation without representation]
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these property-value pairs becomes a triple describing the
page; for example, if that page were called “Declaration of
Independence”, we would have triples such as ([Declaration of
Independence] concerns politics) and ([Declaration of Independence]
supersedes [Taxation without representation]) in the semantic network.</p>
<p>Such a database is only interesting insofar as you can query it, and
Sniki had a very easy and powerful way to query:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Y]ou can produce tables from database-style queries like this:</p>
<p>[tabulate recipes recipe ID, ID title Title, ID description Description, ID date Date]</p>
<p>… In general a query looks like [tabulate clause1, clause2, ...]
where each clause is a triple denoting a typed link, with variables
capitalized.  The table then shows one row for each way of filling
in all the variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the query is Prolog-like, and the results of matching the query
against the database of triples is displayed as a table.  The
“recipes” page I wrote on it when Darius had it running read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These came from an introduction to Ruby on Rails.  I wondered how
easy we could make the same sort of thing without 'programming' or a
relational database.  That example app also had forms for update and
templates for the different pages, though.</p>
<p>[tabulate recipes recipe ID,<br />
ID title Title,<br />
ID description Description,<br />
ID date Date]</p>
<p>Here's just desserts:<br />
[tabulate recipes recipe ID,<br />
ID title Dessert,<br />
ID is-dessert true]</p>
<p>Just recipes Beatrice likes:</p>
<p>[tabulate recipes recipe ID,<br />
ID title Title,<br />
ID description Description,<br />
ID date Date,<br />
ID beatrice-likes yes]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rendered as three tables: one with ID, Title, Description, and
Date columns, another with ID and Dessert columns, and a third with
the same columns as the first but fewer rows.</p>
<p>This page had the following property-value pairs:</p>
<pre><code>recipe recipe1
recipe recipe2
recipe new-recipe-for-rohit
</code></pre>
<p>The page new-recipe-for-rohit had the following property-value pairs:</p>
<pre><code>title [hot cocoa]
description [Everyone's favorite]
date [20 April 2005]
is-dessert true
[see also] sniki
beatrice-likes yes
author [Kragen]
</code></pre>
<p>Being linked from the “recipes” page with a “recipe” property marked
it as being a recipe, although an [is recipe] property like the
is-dessert property would have worked too.  Because it’s a dessert and
Beatrice likes it, it shows up in all three tables.</p>
<p>Another page explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ccs.mit.edu/papers/CCSWP181/">Experiments with Oval</a> from
1994 partly inspired this. It's a hypertext system built around
Objects, Views, Agents, and Links, to make it possible for ordinary
people to create collaborative apps without 'real' programming.  The
current to-do list comes partly out of this paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly I still haven’t read the Oval paper.</p>
<h2>Providing an editable spreadsheet view of a query result</h2>
<p>A feature of Sniki that was at times annoying was the fact that every
variable in the query was visible in the table; the above queries, for
example, include an ID column that says meaningless things like
“recipe2”.  However, by the same token, if you added an “add row”
button, it would be straightforward to insert the necessary triples
into the database, or “assert” them, in Prolog terminology.</p>
<p>This is fairly asymmetric with deletion, since the absence of any one
of the triples necessary for a table row would result in deleting the
table row; in my recipe example above, deleting either the title, the
description, or the date property — as well as the recipe link — would
remove the row from the table.  In cases like these, you’d probably
want deletion to delete the entity and all the links to and from it,
as well as perhaps the links that use it as a link type.</p>
<p>This suggests that in some cases you’d want to use a nested query,
like a Prolog <code>findall</code>, for entities you want to appear in the table
even if they lack a certain property — which probably suggests you’d
like them to occur only once even if they have more than one value for
the property.  Perhaps you could use nested <code>[]</code> for this if you want
a lightweight textual syntax:</p>
<pre><code>[Invoice for Customer, Invoice date Date, Customer name Name,
    [Invoice line-item Item,
    Item qty Quantity,
    Item price Price,
    Item sku SKU,
    SKU description Description],
    [Invoice payment Payment, Payment amount Amount, Payment date Date],
]
</code></pre>
<p>These nested queries would appear as nested tables in the table view,
optionally with the ability to add, copy, update, and delete rows, or
collapse the nested table.</p>
<p>An alternative, nesting-free way to handle nested queries is with a
sort of outline view using something very vaguely like Prolog’s <code>!</code>
cut operator:</p>
<pre><code>[Invoice for Customer, Invoice date Date, Customer name Name
| Invoice line-item Item,
  Item qty Quantity,
  Item price Price,
  Item sku SKU,
  SKU description Description]
</code></pre>
<p>The idea here is that, interactively, you can navigate around a
three-column table with Invoice, Customer, Date, and Name columns, and
whatever row you have highlighted in that table, a detail table
appears to the right with the Item, Quantity, Price, SKU, and
Description columns for all the line items for that invoice.  It’s
like Prolog’s “cut” in the limited sense that once you succeed in
getting to the right of it (in this case, because the user has
selected the row) and exhaust the possibilities there, you don’t cross
to the right of it again.  Unlike Prolog’s cut, though, you do keep
examining possibilities to the left of it in order to fill up the rest
of the table there.</p>
<p>Here’s a crude mockup with example data mostly from <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/exampledb.py">exampledb.py</a>:</p>
<table class="pto-example">
<tr><td><table>

<p>Ideally you could tag the generated ID columns so they don’t display
by default and so that an “add” command generates them automatically
from some kind of id-generating function, even if Joe Celko <em>does</em>
think this is a bad way to make a database:</p>
<table class="pto-example">

<h3>Field editing</h3>
<p>I’ve said that record <em>creation</em> is straightforward with such a
system, but <em>update</em> is surprisingly rather complicated.  In a
database viewer that displays a single SQL table as a table, it’s
straightforward to know which record to update: you update the
database record that corresponds to the table row on the screen.
Here, editing fields is a bit trickier.</p>
<p>In the above example query, the Description field in the line-item
table came from the SKU entity, that is, the description of the
product.  In a case like this, it might not be ideal to automatically
propagate edits to the SKU (and thus to all the other invoices and
perhaps the web page for the product as well); conceivably you’d want
the field to display read-only or to be a link to a detail page for
the SKU entity itself, so that you could see the scope of the change
you were making.</p>
<p>How about the SKU field itself, which links the line-item entity with
the SKU entity?  Suppose you choose to display the field and then edit
it, changing “sku759” to “sku751”.  There are at least two reasonable
candidate results of such an action:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You could update both the triple (li181314 sku sku759) and the
   triple (sku759 description [Gold spandex surgical dress, size L])
   to use “sku751” instead of “sku759”.  This would probably need to
   propagate to all the other occurrences of “sku759” in the system,
   as well.  And, in this case, this would amount to merging two SKUs,
   since “sku751” already exists (it’s the black spandex electronic
   boxers, size M), which is perhaps a situation the user should be
   warned about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could update just the triple (li181314 sku sku759), where we
   originally got “sku759”, to point to some other SKU that has a
   description; this will change the value displayed in the column to
   the right.  Displaying this description during the selection
   process is probably necessary, too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Recursion</h3>
<p>If you name queries, you could very reasonably refer to a query within
itself:</p>
<pre><code>explore(Dir) :- Dir contains-file File, File file-size Size | explore(File).
</code></pre>
<p>With the columnar presentation described above, this is a
Miller-columns filesystem explorer like the one in MacOS X, while with
a collapsible tree view, it would be a tree-style filesystem explorer.</p>
