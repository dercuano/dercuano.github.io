(2 minutes)</div><p>There’s a data structure for representing sets of small integers, up
to M integers less than N, using a count variable and two arrays, A of
size M and B of size N.  The membership test is</p>
<pre><code>mem(i)  ⇐  B[i] &lt; count  ∧  A[B[i]] == i
</code></pre>
<p>from which you can derive the constant-time item insertion, item
deletion, start-unordered-iteration, iterate-next-item, and
set-to-empty-set operations.  Additionally the array contents do not
need to be initialized, so creating a new such set is a constant-time
operation (although not, I suspect, in standard C, since I think
reading the uninitialized data in B[i] is undefined behavior).</p>
<p>You can also use this structure as a sparse array, either adding an
additional array of data-values parallel to A or by making A an array
of (small-int, data-value) tuples.  And in particular I was thinking
that this could be useful for scanline rendering of overlapping or
self-intersecting polygons.  The idea is that, to compute a scan line,
you maintain a sparse array of pixel value changes (polygon
boundaries), and the resulting scan line is the prefix sum of that
sparse array.</p>
<p>This requires efficient sequential (rather than unordered) access to
the items of the set, but this is readily provided by running a
sorting step after you’re done storing boundaries into the array, but
before you start generating pixels.  It’s not quite constant-time per
drawing operation, but it’s pretty close.</p>
<p>(Asymptotically speaking, it would be better to iterate over the B
array, since you need to visit every pixel anyway.  In practice, this
is probably silly.)</p>
<p>By using subpixel coordinates as the indices in B, you should be able
to get decent antialiasing in the X dimension at little additional
cost.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you can extend this to painting translucent or
gradient-filled polygons; that seems like it would require a
nearest-neighbor kind of test to find out what color a given range
currently was.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
