<p>A substantial part of the work of editing natural-language text
amounts to rearranging small pieces of it, and these pieces most
frequently correspond to natural units, such as words, clauses,
prepositional phrases, sentences, and paragraphs.  Existing text
editors fall far short of the optimum in this.</p>
<p>Emacs has commands for moving by and deleting characters, words,
sentences, lines, S-expressions, paragraphs, and in some cases, pages.
You would think that this would make it easy to do sequences like “go
back five words, delete two words, and then insert them at the end
(suitably defined) of the sentence.”  But if you attempt to apply that
sentence to the end of itself, this is what you get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“go back five words, delete two words, and then insert them at the
end () of the sentence.”suitably defined</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than, as you might hope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“go back five words, delete two words, and then insert them at the
end of the sentence (suitably defined).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, you might hope that backward-word (M-b in Emacs parlance)
would take you to the same position as backward-word backward-word
forward-word (M-b M-b M-f), at least if there was a second word to
move backwards over.  But, as far as I know, it never does; the first
sequence leaves you at the end of a word separator, while the second
sequence leaves you at its beginning.  Consequently, after the second
sequence, you can use kill-word (M-d) to delete one or more words
including any leading separators, which you can then insert again
coherently at a position before another word separator.  For example,
starting from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can |then insert again coherently at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you can use M-f M-d M-d M-f C-y to get to this desirable state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can then coherently insert again| at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could make the same edit from this different starting position:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can then insert again coherently| at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>by using C-f M-DEL M-b M-b C-y:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can then coherently |insert again at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>M-DEL is backward-kill-word, which, unlike M-d, includes any
<em>following</em> separators; thus the necessity for the initial C-f to
avoid this mess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can then coherently|insert again  at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires slightly nontrivial cleanup, and the situation is worse
in programming languages.  Transient-mark mode, M-@, M-h, and C-M-SPC
can help significantly, but they don’t really solve the problem.</p>
<p>The underlying difficulty here is that in Emacs, a sentence is not a
sequence of words; it is a sequence of alternating words and word
separators, which contains nearly twice as many elements as words.
Since it would take twice as long to get anywhere if the movement
commands moved by such elements, they move past the large elements,
and you can use character-movement commands to fine-tune.
Unfortunately, this leads to a lot of fine-tuning, user errors when
you get the fine-tuning wrong, and unnecessary round trips to make
sure the fine-tuning is right.</p>
<p>The same difficulty attends Emacs’s commands for sentences and
S-expressions, though typically not lines and paragraphs.</p>
<h2>lowriter</h2>
<p>LibreOffice Writer clones Microsoft Word’s text editing command set,
which in its turn is copied from early Macintosh, and thence from
Bravo and Smalltalk.  Its word movement commands (Ctrl-← and Ctrl-→)
take you to the beginnings of words or the beginnings of non-space
strings between words, and they are the same positions in both
directions.  Its word deletion command, Ctrl-Backspace, deletes back
to these same positions, except that it also has stopping positions at
the beginnings of paragraphs, even empty ones.  (Also, lowriter
considers embedded apostrophes, though not trailing apostrophes, to be
parts of words; similarly, embedded commas are parts of words if they
have digits on both sides of them, though periods are not.)  It
doesn’t seem to have commands to move by sentences, although it does
have movement by paragraphs (Ctrl-↑ and Ctrl-↓).  This works better
than Emacs’s word-movement approach in most cases, but not all.  The
first example above, commanded as as Ctrl-← Ctrl-← Ctrl-← Ctrl-Shift-←
Ctrl-Shift-← Ctrl-Shift-← Ctrl-Shift-← Ctrl-x Ctrl-→ Ctrl-→ Ctrl-→
Ctrl-v, yields this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“go back five words, delete two words, and then insert them at the
end of the sentence(suitably defined) .”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the second example:</p>
<p>commanded as Ctrl-→ Ctrl-Shift-→ Ctrl-Shift-→ Ctrl-x Ctrl-→ Ctrl-v,
comes out fine, though slightly different from Emacs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can then coherently insert again |at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the third example, which logically should have the same problem as
Emacs, when commanded as Ctrl-Shift-← Ctrl-x Ctrl-← Ctrl-← Ctrl-v:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can then insert again coherently| at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instead also comes out fine; the space to the left of “coherently” was
deleted immediately after the word itself, and upon being inserted at
the beginning of “insert”, a space is appended to preserve the
pre-cut-and-paste word boundaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can then coherently |insert again at</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you paste into the middle of a word, spaces are inserted both
before and after; if you paste into the middle of whitespace, spaces
are inserted neither before or after.  If you paste between a
sentence-ending word and the sentence-ending punctuation, space is
inserted before the pasted word, but not after; no corresponding
cleanup seems to exist for pasting to the beginning of a sentence.
However, if the string you deleted was “coherently ”, with the
trailing space, as it would be if you used the word movement commands
to find both ends of the selection, or if it was “coherentl”, not
touching the final word boundary, none of this magic DWIM whitespace
behavior happens.</p>
<p>I suspect that the reason for the DWIM behavior is that, in lowriter,
if you select words by double-clicking with the mouse, instead of
using Ctrl-Shift-← and Ctrl-Shift-→, the space after the word is not
included in your selection!</p>
<p>Also, in lowriter, triple-click selects by sentences, but doesn’t
include whitespace surrounding the sentence; this means that if you
rearrange a sequence of sentences by triple-click and drag-and-drop,
you have to clean up whitespace afterward, in a way exactly analogous
to the Emacs word-separator problem described above.  Quadruple-click
(!!) selects paragraphs, but only single paragraphs; dragging outside
the paragraph reverts to selecting by characters.</p>
<h2>Vim</h2>
<p>Vim’s word movement commands (w and b, not e and ge) seem to be
entirely consistent with lowriter, except that they treat apostrophes
and commas like any other punctuation; and deleting, cutting, and
pasting is consistent with movement, though of course without DWIM.</p>
<p>When programming in Emacs, I’ve often been frustrated by its
word-movement commands skipping over long sequences of punctuation and
whitespace as if they weren’t even there.  Vim’s command structure is
significantly better in this regard.</p>
<h2>Eclipse</h2>
<p>Eclipse’s word movement commands have the same problem as Emacs’s.</p>
<h2>New editor design thoughts</h2>
<p>What should the command set for a new editor look like?</p>
<h3>Established movement-command convention</h3>
<p>Assuming that MacOS and Microsoft Word are consistent with lowriter,
violating their word movement and deletion command convention is
costly; Vim’s behavior is also consistent with it, and the behavior
seems to be both more predictable and more frequently what is desired
without DWIM magic.  But the fact that lowriter does resort to DWIM
magic behavior under fairly normal circumstances suggests that perhaps
a better alternative is possible.</p>
<h3>Selection-verb versus Emacs or Vim commands</h3>
<p>The Smalltalk and Bravo selection-verb convention, imitated in
Macintosh and in nearly all subsequent GUIs, of first selecting a
region of text visibly and then applying subsequent commands to that
region of text, is substantially more predictable than the Emacs and
Vim approach of applying commands to regions computed after the
command starts.  Both the selection-verb convention and the Vim
approach enjoy substantially better orthogonality than the Emacs
command set, although by the same token the Emacs commands are often
shorter:</p>
<pre><code>|           | forward  | backward | mark                 | delete/kill    | backward delete/kill    |
| char      | C-f      | C-b      |                      | C-d            | DEL                     |
| word      | M-f      | M-b      | M-@                  | M-d            | M-DEL, C-backspace      |
| sentence  | M-e      | M-a      | mark-end-of-sentence | M-k            | C-x DEL                 |
| line      | C-p      | C-n      |                      | C-k (XXX),     |                         |
|           |          |          |                      | C-S-backspace  |                         |
| paragraph | M-}, C-↓ | M-{, C-↑ | M-h                  | kill-paragraph | backward-kill-paragraph |
| sexp      | C-M-f    | C-M-b    | C-M-SPC              | C-M-k          | ESC C-backspace         |
</code></pre>
<p>Of these 27 different keystroke commands, I think only 16 are in my
own subconscious repertoire, and that’s after 30 years of this body
using one or another Emacs.  Some of those work in readline, or GTK
(by default), while others don’t, adding to the difficulty.</p>
<h3>Ctrl-backspace</h3>
<p>Ctrl-backspace is extremely valuable, more valuable even than
backspace, because it eliminates not only keystrokes but also feedback
round trips.  (I mistyped that “trips” as “tirps”, for example, and
then used Ctrl-backspace to delete it and type the correct word.)
Replacing Ctrl-backspace with a selection-verb sequence like
Ctrl-Shift-← Ctrl-x (which does work in lowriter, for example) would
be intolerable, unless both the selection and the verb were a single
keystroke, could be released in an indeterminate order, and supported
repeating without fiddly key alternation.</p>
<h3>Multilevel cut and paste</h3>
<p>Emacs’s killing and C-y and M-y behavior is also extremely valuable:
it means you don’t have to decide ahead of time which deleted text you
are going to want to paste later, and you don’t have to worry about
losing text on the clipboard by cutting something else.  Every
mainstream UI has supported multilevel undo for over 20 years,
eliminating the danger of losing your undo information with a
following command (the famous modal UI “edit” problem, in which “e”
selected “everything”, “d” deleted it, “i” went into insert mode, and
“t” was inserted, losing the undo info.)  It’s long since time they
supported multilevel cut and paste!</p>
<h3>The Back button</h3>
<p>Emacs’s C-u C-SPC command, which pops the mark stack, is extremely
useful for returning to editing what you were just editing before your
last search; it’s like a WWW browser “back” button, but inside a
single editor buffer.  It really needs a more convenient keybinding,
one that can be repeated without key alternation.  Browsers bind it to
Alt-← and, historically, Backspace, although that’s going away, but
something you can type without taking your fingers off the home row
would be superb.</p>
<h3>Text movement</h3>
<p>Eclipse’s Alt-↑ and Alt-↓ keybindings for moving a block of lines
(either the current line, or the selected block, expanded to full
lines) are one of the few code-editing features in Eclipse that I miss
in Emacs and Vim.  They don’t work as well for text in paragraphs,
since it tends to have logical boundaries that don’t coincide with
line boundaries, but you could imagine a similar command set that did
work well; lowriter, for example, permits drag-and-drop rearrangement
of text fragments with the mouse, although it doesn’t provide ongoing
feedback about the final result.</p>
<p>Emacs has a set of “transpose” commands which can in theory be used
for this, but they are awkward to use: they only move single units (of
whatever size: lines, sentences, sexps, words, chars — but not blocks
of two lines or words or whatever), only forward, and only two of them
have default keybindings that can be repeated without alternating keys
(C-x C-t is transpose-lines, which doesn’t take advantage of the
transient map feature in recent versions of Emacs that, for example,
allows C-x e e e to run the last keyboard macro three times.)</p>
<h3>Movement via incremental search</h3>
<p>Incremental-search, which originated in Emacs in the 1970s is
extremely valuable, both for the usual search purposes and for cursor
movement, as Jef Raskin showed in his work (on the Canon Cat,
SwyftWare, The Humane Environment, and Archy).  It’s an even faster
means of cursor movement than using the mouse.  Unfortunately, Emacs’s
implementation of incremental-search is crippled for cursor movement
in a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When searching <em>forward</em>, Emacs incremental-search leaves the
   cursor at the <em>end</em> of the search string, not its beginning.  That
   means that if you want to move the cursor from “extremely” above to
   the start of “beginning” in this paragraph, you can’t simply search
   for “beginning”; you’ll end up somewhere in the middle of the word
   or at its end.  Instead you must search for “its “, and the search
   is no longer effectively incremental — even though “it” is
   sufficient to uniquely identify the string you’re searching for,
   you have to keep typing to get to the place you want.
   Alternatively, you can search for “beginning” and then issue an
   extra command to get from the middle to the beginning of
   “beginning”; this requires typing only up to “be”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emacs’s incremental-search is modal, requiring an extra keystroke
   to terminate it.  This can result in mode errors, where later
   keystrokes are erroneously used as part of the search key, but the
   larger problem is that it is a significant amount of overhead.  The
   Canon Cat, for example, used its quasimodal “LEAP” to move by
   paragraphs by searching for paragraph breaks, or by “sentences” by
   searching for periods; releasing “LEAP” ended the search.  Thus
   “search for the next newline” was “LEAP-Return”, releasing “LEAP”
   after “Return”, the same number of keystrokes as Emacs’s M-a or
   C-e; it’s a sequence of three events.  Using C-s . RET in Emacs is,
   by contrast, a sequence of six events: Ctrl down, S down, release
   all, period down, RET down, release all.  A benefit of being modal
   in this way is that the same C-s and C-r keystrokes can repeat the
   search in different directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an additional problem, the particular keystroke Emacs chose to
   terminate incremental-search is RET or Enter.  This makes it
   unintuitive and inconvenient to search for newlines (you can do it
   by typing Ctrl-J, although I don’t know if I knew that until I
   tried it just now).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Vim’s incremental search avoids problem #1, but still has problems #2
and #3, and actually problem #3 is even worse: /^V^J RET in Vim
searches for NUL rather than LF.  Searching for an actual linefeed in
Vim requires /\n RET.</p>
<p>A separate tweak to text incremental search is to display further
search hits in context in a separate pane once they’re infrequent
enough, allowing a smooth transition from in-context navigation to
menu navigation.</p>
<h3>Multiple cursors</h3>
<p>The proprietary Sublime Text editor’s multiple-cursor feature seems
like a better alternative to keyboard macros under most circumstances,
because it allows you to see the effects of all the “iterations” of
your “macro” incrementally as you are composing it.  But I’m getting
off on a tangent.</p>
<h3>Selection command design</h3>
<p>Most of that is preamble to say that I think the selection-verb model
is generally better, but you need sufficiently powerful selection
commands to keep that model from being too clumsy.  For rearranging
text by word, sentence, or paragraph, perhaps you could use a command
like Emacs’s M-@, which extends the selection to the end of the next
word, thus allowing you to select multiple words by repeating the
command — but with semantics more like Emacs’s M-h, which also extends
the beginning of the selection to the previous paragraph boundary, if
it isn’t already there (except that it does the wrong thing if there’s
already a selection which wasn’t created by M-h).  So, in Emacs, M-h
selects one paragraph, M-h M-h selects two paragraphs, and so on; a
new editor could have keybindings that operate similarly.</p>
<p>Three such keybindings — select-word, select-sentence, and
select-paragraph — would allow you to quickly select the span of text
you want to operate on, if it’s less than, say, four logical units
long.  Making longer selections would be faster with the mouse or
using incremental search, requiring the user to strategize as to how
to make the selection, and potentially causing long decision times
around the break-even point due to the problem of Buridan’s Ass; to
the extent that we can avoid imposing the need to strategize on the
user, we can shorten the path to the user’s desire.  (The kfitzat
haderech is the ultimate user interface!)</p>
<p>S-expression selection is somewhat trickier because there are at least
two potential directions the user might want to expand their
selection: forward to the following expression, and up the
S-expression tree.  So a single keybinding for marking sexps will not
suffice.  Thus Emacs provides forward-sexp (C-M-f), backward-sexp
(C-M-b), mark-sexp (C-M-SPC, which extends the region forward),
down-list (C-M-d), backward-up-list (C-M-u), up-list, kill-sexp
(C-M-k), backward-kill-sexp (ESC C-backspace), and
kill-backward-up-list.  Maybe the right solution is to repurpose the
select-word and select-sentence keybindings in programming-language
modes.</p>
<p>Perhaps mouse selection can give an indication of the desired
granularity of selection by its speed: if the mouse is moving too fast
for the user to have intended to select at the granularity of a single
character or even a single word, perhaps sentence or even paragraph
granularity was intended.  If the mouse selection starts out with the
incorrect granularity, the user can correct it by moving the mouse
faster or slower as they drag out the rest of the selection.  This
mechanism could smoothly incorporate probabilities from stochastic
models of natural language to permit sub-sentence selections,
including things like dependent clauses and prepositional phrases.</p>
<h3>Delimiter behavior</h3>
<p>But you still have the problem of the fenceposts or delimiters: when
are they included in the selection and when are they excluded?</p>
<p>If there’s an improved model of text that permits a better user
interface for rearranging bits of it, I suspect it looks something
like, “Paragraphs are sequences of sentences.  Sentences are sequences
of words.”  This avoids the fencepost problems described earlier,
where you move by words, cut by words, and then paste, and yet you end
up merging words or creating extra spaces.  This is not too far from
the model implicit in the Vim command set, where w and b take you to
the beginnings of words or punctuation strings.</p>
<p>The sequence-of-words model does potentially have the problem
lowriter’s DWIM is trying to patch up: a sequence of words in a
different context might need different word separators around them.
For example, if I were to replace “around them” in the previous
sentence by moving “in a different context” to the end of the
sentence, including a space after that phrase would be inappropriate.</p>
<p>A possible solution to this problem might be something like the
following data model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Words are nonempty sequences of alphanumeric characters, with
   possible exceptions for things like apostrophes and commas in
   numbers.</li>
<li>Words are always terminated by word terminators, which are inserted
   automatically if not present, as Vim does with trailing newlines in
   a text file.  All word terminators terminate nonempty words.</li>
<li>Word terminators followed by words are displayed (and, in plain
   text, serialized) as spaces.</li>
<li>Word terminators followed by punctuation or paragraph breaks are
   not displayed (or serialized in plain text).</li>
<li>Spaces following other spaces or punctuation — anything that isn’t
   a word — represent real spaces, not word terminators.</li>
<li>Paragraph breaks are always preceded by a word terminator or real
   space, which is not displayed (or serialized in plain text).</li>
</ol>
<p>This provides a bijective mapping between displayed character
sequences and internal character sequences.  In one direction, spaces
following alphanumerics and preceding either spaces or alphanumerics
are converted to word terminators, and word terminators are inserted
before punctuation that follows alphanumerics; in the other direction,
word terminators are converted to spaces unless they precede
punctuation.</p>
<p>In terms of commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>Word movement commands move to points which include the beginnings
   of words, beginnings of paragraphs, and beginnings of punctuation
   strings.</li>
<li>Mouse selection of words selects between the same points word
   movement commands move to, and thus includes the fucking word
   terminators.</li>
<li>Movement by sentences moves to the beginnings of sentences.  The
   sentence terminator pattern </li>
<li>Selection by sentences includes the sentence-ending punctuation,
   any following punctuation before space, and any following spaces,
   including the invisible space preceding a paragraph break, but not
   the space that often precedes the beginning of the sentence; that
   space belongs to the previous sentence.  It also includes any
   punctuation at the beginning of the sentence following spaces that
   belonged to a previous sentence, such as an open parenthesis or
   open quote.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like lowriter’s approach, this provides the right behavior for cutting
and pasting sequences of words from the ends of sentences to the
middles and from the middles to the ends; however, it does so in a way
that is predictable because it is consistent with its data model,
rather than being a DWIM special case.  Unlike lowriter’s approach, it
also provides the right behavior for cutting and pasting sentences
from anywhere in a paragraph to any other sentence boundary in a
paragraph.  Like lowriter’s approach, it still requires manual cleanup
for cutting and pasting sequences of words to or from the beginnings
of sentences.  It differs from lowriter's approach when you select a
word (or several words) with the mouse and either copy or move it to
the interior or end of another word: in that case, it will paste with
a space after it but not before, as lowriter does when you make the
same selection using keyboard selection commands.</p>
<p>How well will these rules apply to programming languages, should you
be editing a program in natural-language mode?  Since the mapping
between the internal representation and the serialized one is
bijective, it shouldn’t pose any particularly serious problems.</p>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>I think the editor should use game mechanics to teach you to use its
command set in the way we have Tayloristically determined to be the
most effective.</p>
<h3>Autosuggest</h3>
<p>The editor should use a neural network pretrained on a corpus of
existing open-source projects and natural-language text, then later
trained on the things you actually write in it, to order and possibly
even add autocompletion suggestions.  It can also adjust the frequency
of autosuggest suggestions to the circumstances: if the human
frequently accepts a suggestion or peruses the options, it should
offer suggestions more frequently.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/hci.html">Human–computer interaction</a> (76 notes)
