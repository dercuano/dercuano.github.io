<p>(This idea is probably bad because we can’t eliminate the cost of lock
acquisition completely; we still need to conditionally block if the
lock is acquired.)</p>
<p>Zero-overhead exception handling uses a map of executable code regions
to analyze the stack trace at the time an exception is thrown to
discover where to invoke the exception handler.  This way, a <code>try { }</code>
statement, or in C++ the code to destruct a stack object during
exception unwinding, has zero run-time overhead in the normal case; it
just makes the executable a little bigger.  Throwin an exception is
slower than using a <code>setjmp()/longjmp()</code> style of exception handling,
but this is still a net win, because exceptions are very rare compared
to entering and leaving contexts that add tasks to carry out during
stack unwinding.</p>
<p>Analogously, acquiring a lock is a very common operation in
threads-and-locks programming, and typically a very expensive one.
But we only care what locks you hold when another thread might contend
them.  In a “green thread” or “fiber” environment, only one thread is
actually running at a time, and context switches between threads are
relatively uncommon.</p>
<p>In a language like Java, locks are normally managed by entering and
leaving <code>synchronized</code> statements and methods.  These can be
discovered by walking the stack in the same way that exception
handlers can.</p>
<p>This suggests the following implementation technique for locks in a
green-threads environment: don’t maintain the runtime state of which
locks are held by the current thread at all, although of course you
still need to test to see if a lock is held when entering a context
that requires it.  Instead, when the thread yields to the scheduler,
the scheduler walks its stack to reconstruct the set of locks it
holds.  Then it marks those locks as “held” before choosing which next
thread to run.</p>
<p>This slows down context switching, but speeds up lock acquisition,
making it affordable to acquire more locks.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
