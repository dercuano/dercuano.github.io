<p>IBNIZ is viznut’s bytebeat and display-hack virtual machine; it uses a
stack-based instruction set, and when it’s in run mode, it’s
constantly executing the program as you edit it.  The program runs
repeatedly on the same stack, and whatever it leaves on the stack is
interpreted as pixels to paint the screen contents.  (Audio works
similarly.)</p>
<p>I was just reading Longo’s <em>Introduction to DECSystem-20 Assembly
Programming</em> and thinking about how the DEC assemblers and the
assembler described in <a href="../notes/nova-rdos.html">Nova RDOS</a> didn’t have even the machine’s
fundamental opcodes defined internally; they were defined as manifest
constants and macros, but basically almost all the assembler did by
default was put numbers into memory and build a symbol table, which
always seemed like a really cool idea to me.  (And it was fundamental
to how Gates, Allen, and Davidoff wrote Microsoft BASIC, by
incrementally hacking the DEC machine into emulating an 8080.)</p>
<p>The first example program in Longo begins as follows:</p>
<pre><code>EXAMPLE 1, ADDING TWO NUMBERS
I:    3    ;I=3
K:    2    ;K=2
J:    0    ;save a spot called J
</code></pre>
<p>This assembles three numbers into memory and sticks three entries into
the symbol table.</p>
<p>Now, symbol tables are awesome and really flexible, but it would be
even simpler if we could do without them, at least at the fundamental
level.  And some constructs — notably nestable conditionals and
loops — are somewhat awkward to write in macro assemblers using
labels.  I mean, it’s not that the labels stop you, but they don’t
help.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that maybe a stack-based assembler that filled the
object file the way IBNIZ fills the screen could work.</p>
<h2>How it would work</h2>
<p>If the assembler interprets the input <code>3 2 0</code>, it would first push 3
on the stack, then 2, then 0.  If that’s the whole input, those stack
contents are, in some encoding, the contents of the binary file it
will write out.  Similarly, if the input contains <code>"ABC"</code>, some
representation of that string gets pushed onto the stack — maybe 65 66
67 3, the UTF-8 values of the string and then its length, for example.
But then you could define “macros”, little functions that would pop
things off the stack, change the state of the interpreter, and push
more things back onto the stack.  For example, you might have a <code>MOV</code>
macro that would push the encoding of a MOV instruction onto the
stack, popping off an appropriate number of operands.</p>
<p>(Such an assembler designed for AMD64 machines would need to work in
bytes, while a SPARC assembler might be easier if it worked in 32-bit
words.  You could in theory do the conversion at the end of the
process.)</p>
<h2>Advantages; the landscape</h2>
<p>Nestable control structures — the whole raison d’etre of this goofy
idea — would use a third stack for their jump addresses, in addition
to the operand stack that’s accumulating the output file and the macro
execution stack that keeps track of which macros are invoking which.
And adding some peephole optimization would be pretty trivial,
although you’d have to be careful with variable-length instruction
encodings, and you might want to have some kind of low water mark that
prevented such rewriting, since you wouldn’t want to invalidate a jump
destination.  (Your macros could still inspect the previously emitted
code, though.)</p>
<p>You’d still have a symbol table, of course, so you can call named
functions.  It would just be built and maintained by macros.</p>
<p>Although you’d probably want to use some kind of RPN syntax, there’s
no reason the macros would have to be programmed at a FORTH-like
level, except perhaps as a bootstrappability exercise.  On the
contrary, the compile-time macro data world can be garbage-collected,
dynamically-dispatched, pattern-matching, backtracking, theorem
proving, SAT solving, whatever is most convenient for writing bits of
compiler macros.  PostScript and Factor are not the limit.</p>
<p>If you gave the compiler macro language the ability to read from its
own input stream — the way FORTH immediate words do in order to read
the name of a word to define, for example, or the way PostScript
programs do to incrementally read and render bitmap data — you could
convert your macro assembler into a compiler for arbitrary languages
by providing different preludes.  It might not be a good idea, but you
could do it.</p>
<p>What’s the difference from emitting binary from whatever random
high-level language?  The smooth incremental path from manually typing
in (or hexdumping) some binary data to refactoring parts of it to
enable you to generate more of it.</p>
<h2>Self-bootstrapping</h2>
<p>Maybe also the smooth incremental path of building more capable
assemblers.  This might be a way to do something like StoneKnifeForth
that gradually adds features from one stage of the language to the
next, without ever requiring a backwards-incompatible language leap.
The most basic bootstrap compiler could handle nothing more than
converting binary to decimal, while valid input to it could remain
valid for all later versions.  Here’s a somewhat small, though surely
not minimal, implementation of such a basic bootstrap.  This is for
AMD64 Linux, and it doesn’t check its input for validity.</p>
<pre><code>        ## Convert space-separated decimal numbers to binary

        ## You know, I think this is almost the same as the i386
        ## system call interface, but maybe with different registers?
        ## Also, different system call numbers!  On i386 %eax=1 is
        ## _exit().

        .globl _start
        ## First, read a byte:
_start: xor %edi, %edi          # fd 0
        mov $buf, %esi          # into buf
        xor %edx, %edx
        inc %edx                # 1 byte
        xor %eax, %eax          # _NR_read is 0
        syscall

        test %eax, %eax         # quit if error or EOF
        jle done

        ## Only if we’ve got a space, write out the number:
        mov (buf), %eax
        cmp $32, %eax
        jne keep_converting

        ## We got a space, so we should write out our byte:
        mov %ebx, (buf)         # store byte into buf
        xor %edi, %edi
        inc %edi                # fd 1
        mov $buf, %esi          # write from buf
        mov %edi, %edx          # 1 byte
        mov %edi, %eax          # _NR_write is 1
        syscall

        ## Then repeat:
        xor %ebx, %ebx          # clear accumulating number
        jmp _start

keep_converting:
        imul $10, %ebx
        mov (buf), %eax
        and $15, %eax
        add %eax, %ebx
        jmp _start

        ## Got EOF or error, so exit.
done:   xor %edx, %edx
        mov $231, %eax          # _NR_exit_group in unistd_64.h
        syscall

        .data
        .align 8
buf:    .byte 0
        .byte 0
        .byte 0
        .byte 0

        .byte 0
        .byte 0
        .byte 0
        .byte 0
</code></pre>
<p>This can reproduce its own 119 bytes of machine code (well, of an
earlier version of itself) given this input:</p>
<pre><code>echo 49 255 190 96 1 96 0 49 210 255 194 49 192 15 \
5 133 192 126 55 139 4 37 96 1 96 0 131 248 32 117 26 49 255 255 199 137 \
28 37 96 1 96 0 190 96 1 96 0 137 250 137 248 15 5 49 219 235 199 107 219 \
10 139 4 37 96 1 96 0 131 224 15 1 195 235 182 49 210 184 231 0 0 0 15 \
5' '|./binout &gt; binout.bin
</code></pre>
<p>Reproducing a valid ELF executable presumably requires a few dozen
more numbers, hopefully not hundreds.</p>
<p>So once you have that working, you can patch in a couple more features
and fix up some jump offsets.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
