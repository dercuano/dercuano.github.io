(3 minutes)</div><p>I keep thinking about the explanation in the Art of Electronics† of how
reading DRAM works.  Each column of the DRAM has a sense amplifier,
which is kind of like a differential amplifier — it’s actually a latch
consisting of two inverters in a loop.  Before reading, the loop is
shorted to force the inverters into a metastable state; then the short
is released and the appropriate row of capacitors is shorted to the
sense amplifiers.</p>
<p>This unbalances the previously metastable latches, which then fall
into one of their two stable states.  In the process, they charge the
capacitor all the way to the rail.</p>
<p>This is very similar to Merkle’s buckling-spring logic, in which a
gate begins in a stable state which is made metastable by the
application of a buckling force, which amplifies the balance of forces
applied to the spring into a large displacement driven by the buckling
force itself.  Merkle proposed using these as majority-rule gates with
a constant bias input to get AND and OR.</p>
<p>I wonder if such circuits could be a productive way to design digital
circuits even with current technology, integrating state and
combinational logic rather than keeping them separate.  As one simple
example, you could build a bidirectional shift register by using three
latches per bit, energizing only ⅓ to ⅔ of the latches at any given
time, passing the state along in the manner of a CCD or a Dekatron.
Or you could build an image memory that directly supports not only
shifting the image off the chip but also operations like dilation.</p>
<p>My hunch is that this approach ends up being more or less equivalent
to using master-slave flip-flops.</p>
<p>† “The sense amplifiers are latching devices, here drawn notionally as
fed-back noninverting amplifiers.  (In practice they are implemented
as flip-flops that begin the cycle in a balanced state and become
unbalanced by the bit-capacitor charge that is switched into
them. ... In a further dose of reality, things are a bit more
complicated: the sense amplifiers are <em>differential</em>, and the DRAM
array is usually built in a “folded-bit” arrangement so that any given
row line activates only the even or odd cells; the inactive (neutral)
bit line floats at the precharge level (Vdd/2) and acts as a reference
voltage by which the balanced sense amplifier compares the ΔV “bump”
up or down from the capacitor's charge in the respective bit
cell. ...”</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
