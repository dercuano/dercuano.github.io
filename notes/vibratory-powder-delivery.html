(2 minutes)</div><p>One of the problems I’m having with powder-bed processes in the
ceramic studio is that fine powders, whether quartz, feldspar, or
glass, are clumpy.  I’m thinking I can vibrate a tool to break them
up.  I’ve ascertained that some commercial ultrasonic vibrating sieves
use about 200 watts of power per kilogram of vibrating mass; I think I
can get by with 10 grams of apparatus and powder (really more like
100mg of powder) and thus 2 watts, and I'm wondering if piezoelectric
speakers are a plausible way to deliver that vibration.</p>
<p>Digi-Key’s most popular "buzzer element/piezo bender" is the CUI
CEB-20D64, a US$1.38 6.5kHz piezo buzzer element that takes 30 volts
peak-to-peak at an impedance of 350 ohms, which I guess works out to
2.6 watts.</p>
<p>So the answer is yes, cheap piezoelectric speakers have enough power
to do the job.  How about reaching ultrasonic frequencies?</p>
<p>The Murata MA40S4S is a US$6.80 40kHz ultrasonic transmitter; it takes
a 20-volt peak-to-peak square wave input and delivers 120 dB SPL
output at 30cm with a 10Vrms sine wave.  It claims a 2550 pF
capacitance at 1kHz.  Unfortunately, this is not enough information to
estimate its power output, since the SPL (20 Pa) depends on its
directionality, which is not specified.</p>
<p>The next most popular ultrasonic transmitter is the US$4.95 PUI
UT-1240K-TT-R, 40kHz with a 70° -6dB beam angle, running on 30V
peak-to-peak.  It claims 2100pF and 115dB.</p>
<p>(I could totally calculate how much power gets stored in and paid back
from that capacitance at a given frequency and voltage, but what I'm
interested in is the fraction that doesn’t get paid back because it’s
emitted as sound.)</p>
<p>In the "Alarms, Buzzers, and Sirens" Digi-Key category, I find the
much more popular TDK PS1240P02BT, a 33¢ 3V 4kHz single-tone
“piezoelectronic buzzer without oscillator circuit” that TDK markets
for, among other things, “speech synthesis output”; they plot its
frequency response curve out to 10kHz in the 70–80 dBA range at 10cm
and 3V, but it takes up to 30V input.</p>
<p>These are probably in the same power range as the first buzzer,
though, just less directional.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
