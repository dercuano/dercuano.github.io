(36 minutes)</div><p>I was thinking about the problem of displaying graphical user
interfaces and reacting to clicks and other user events in them, and I
think I found an interesting unexplored design space, which seems more
and more promising as I think about it.</p>
<p>To talk about this, I need to talk about a concept that I don’t have a
good name for.  I guess I’ll call it “interaction models”.  This is not
exactly about user interface paradigms as conventionally understood — e.g.,
command-line software, graphical user interfaces, hypertext — although
it’s not entirely orthogonal to them.  It’s more about the model within
which programs using those user-interface paradigms interact with not only
the user, but also each other and the rest of the computing system.
This document is about a new interaction model which I am exploring.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Most existing programs fit fairly cleanly into one of several existing
interaction models: “apps”, “REST”, “batch processing”, “REPL”,
“notebook”, and “open operating system”, though of course there are gray
areas.</p>
<h3>Apps</h3>
<p>The now-conventional (“apps”) model for this is that,
behind the window, there’s a running program, typically on a multitasking
operating system in which it runs in a “process” (a virtual
computer), which has a thread of execution and a stack and a virtual
memory space and whatnot; and, at times, it responds to user interface
events, modifying its internal state and possibly its external
appearance.</p>
<p>This works, and it can be extremely efficient, but it has some
drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s very difficult to return the process
  to a previous state ("undo"), for
  example because a user interface action had an effect you didn’t
  like, or because you wanted to explore some other alternatives.</li>
<li>It’s very difficult to update the code of the process, because its
  internal memory state is entangled with the assignment of addresses
  to pieces of its code in a way that can be difficult to undo.</li>
<li>Data tends to get “siloed” in particular programs, reducing users’
  control over the data and causing them to spend a substantial
  fraction of their time figuring out how to get data out of one
  program and into another.</li>
<li>It uses a lot of memory space and, often, CPU time.</li>
<li>It can be very difficult to migrate the process from one computer to
  another, which is a serious problem now that we’re all carrying lots
  of computers around.</li>
</ul>
<h3>REST</h3>
<p>Another approach is REST.  In REST, the “window” is a document sent to
your user-agent by a server, containing your entire session state and
including links to other resources that may be relevant.  All
applications use the same user-agent and the same resource link
namespace.  REST has a number of advantages over the apps model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The uniform link namespace enables a certain degree of
  interoperability;</li>
<li>previous session states can be stored as “bookmarks” and returned to
  at will, or sent to other people as links;</li>
<li>upgrading the code on the server is completely seamless in most
  cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, because the server is physically far away and because the
user-agents we are using are unbelievably inefficient, current
software is shifting away from the REST model and toward the
apps model.</p>
<h3>Teletypes, typescripts, and the REPL model</h3>
<p>“Apps” are actually somewhat older than graphical user interfaces — in
a sense, an “app” is what you get as soon as you load a program onto a
general-purpose computer and start it running, even if you don’t have
an operating system.  The machine, in essence, starts to manifest in
the physical world the behavior of the abstract machine embodied in
the program — it becomes an avatar of the program, though perhaps
likening programs to devas or gods is blasphemous.  Traditionally,
with or without timesharing, once the program starts running, barring
the invocation of debugging features such as interrupt keys or
single-step switches, your interaction is with the program, not the
computer or the operating system — or, at least, that is the desired
illusion.</p>
<p>In the app model, you launch a program, which puts your user
interface to the machine into a special mode where it behaves
differently until it exits — or, if you have a multitasking user
interface, until you switch tasks.  This is the same way Instagram
interacts on your cellphone in 2018, the same way Sketchpad worked in
1962, and the same way Mel Kaye’s Blackjack program worked on the
LGP-30 in the 1950s.</p>
<p>The LGP-30 was a very simple computer indeed; it contained barely over
a hundred vacuum tubes, and it ran far too slowly to produce a useful
display on an oscilloscope screen.  So the user interface on the
LGP-30 was a Friden Flexowriter, a kind of teletype.</p>
<p>A Teletype™ (or, generically, a teletype) is an electric typewriter
that could be driven either by the computer or by its operator.  (Or,
in its original application, by another teletype, perhaps in another
city.)  This meant that the user interface only needed enough
electronic or electromechanical memory for the single byte currently
being input or output, rather than the dozens of bytes required for
the HP 9100’s calculator display, the kilobyte or more required for
character-cell terminals, or the many kilobytes to megabytes required
for framebuffers.  Some form of teletype was the primary form of user
interface for BASIC, JOSS, and APL in the 1960s, and then Unix in the
1970s, and it remains with us today in the Unix terminal interface,
which even today uses the abbreviation “tty”.</p>
<p>On the teletype, many programs could produce their final permanent
results just by showing them to the user, perhaps without even storing
them in the very limited memory of the time.  For example, if you had
a series of calculations you wanted to carry out in LISP, APL, JOSS,
or BASIC, you could type the formulas into the computer, one after the
other, and on the paper you would have the formulas, each followed by
its result, for ease of future reference.  This form of interactivity
is known today as a REPL, for “read-eval[uate]-print loop”, from its
name in Lisp, and it remains nearly a sine qua non of new programming
languages.</p>
<p>The REPL facility meant that you could write useful interactive
programs in LISP or APL that, paradoxically, contained no code for
processing user input; they merely provided a vocabulary of procedures
for the user to invoke from the REPL, leaving the interaction to the
REPL.</p>
<p>The teletype user interface is very limiting — you can’t even erase a
character once it’s on the paper, and it was common to use baud rates
as low as 110 baud, or 11 characters per second, because the mechanics
couldn’t print any faster anyway.  But it does have some real
advantages over framebuffers and character-cell terminals: you can get
a large character repertoire and also boldface and underlining by
overprinting multiple characters in the same position, and, most
interestingly, the user is left with a complete and indelible record
of their interaction, typically on continuous-feed fanfold paper,
showing both everything they did and everything the computer typed — a
record they could annotate with pencil or pen.</p>
<p>This made it possible to easily produce not only printed textual
documents, but also banners, data tables, and data plots.</p>
<h3>Batch processing</h3>
<p>As an example of app-model glass-teletype interaction, Chapter 6 of
the TeXbook (originally published in 1984 and documenting the 1983
version of TeX that supplanted the 1978 version) talks about how to
start the TeX compiler and then interact with it once it’s started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>log in; and start \TeX. \ (You may have to ask somebody how to do
this on your local computer. Usually the operating system prompts
you for a command and you type ‘<code>tex</code>’ or ‘<code>run tex</code>’ or something
like that.)</p>
<p>When you’re successful, \TeX\ will welcome you with a message such as</p>
<pre><code>This is TeX, Version 3.141 (preloaded format=plain 89.7.15)
**
</code></pre>
<p>The ‘<code>**</code>’ is \TeX’s way of asking you for an input file name.<br />
% Incidentally, 89.7.15 was Jill’s 50th birthday.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now you’re ready for Experiment~2: Get \TeX\ going again.  This time
when the machine says ‘<code>**</code>’ you should answer ‘<code>story</code>’, since that
is the name of the file where your input resides. \ (The file could
also be called by its full name ‘<code>story.tex</code>’, but \TeX\
automatically supplies the suffix ‘<code>.tex</code>’ if no suffix has been
specified.)</p>
<p>…(Previous \TeX\ systems required you to start by typing ‘<code>\input
story</code>’ instead of ‘<code>story</code>’, and you can still do that; but most
\TeX\ users prefer to put all of their commands into a file instead
of typing them online, so \TeX\ now spares them the nuisance of
starting out with <code>\input</code> each time.)…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see that TeX is interacting in the app model.  However, it
seems that for TeX users, app-mode interaction was often a nuisance
that they wanted to minimize.  They preferred to spend their time
preparing the input file for TeX, then processing it as
non-interactively as possible.</p>
<p>This leads us to the “batch-processing” interaction model,
which is almost as old as the app model — or
perhaps older, if you count running punched paper tape through a
Teletype.  In batch processing, you start a program, which runs for a
while, reading input prepared ahead of time and producing output. Then
the program terminates, without having interacted with you at all
while it was running.  Batch-processing operating systems predate
interactive operating systems by a little bit.</p>
<p>Originally, in batch processing, you used a separate, non-computer
machine to prepare your input, in the form of a deck of punched cards
punched on a keypunch or of a reel of punched paper tape punched on a
Teletype.  Perhaps this was an incremental process where you gathered
punched cards from different places, and even a non-mechanized process
where you selected and ordered the punched cards by hand.  (The
equivalent with paper tape involved, as I understand it, knives and
scotch tape.)</p>
<p>Why would you prefer batch processing to interactive processing?</p>
<p>For many years, a primary reason was economic; computers were very
expensive compared to employees.  A computing job that required one
minute of computer time, if done interactively, might require the
operator to go through ten minutes of machine setup and five minutes
of teardown, during which time the computer spent all its time waiting
on the operator, for a total of 16 minutes.  If, instead of <em>operating</em>
the machine manually, you used an <em>operating system</em>, you could do it
in maybe a minute and a half, without requiring any multitasking.
This approach was still occasionally used into the 2000s on
supercomputers, because even though they run multitasking operating
systems, you can sometimes run two jobs faster one after the other
than if you divide the machine’s resources between them.</p>
<p>The queue lengths were sometimes long, and programmers tell of needing
to wait a day or more for their (printed) job output after submitting
their job for processing, back in the 1970s.  So if your one-minute
job contained five bugs, each of which was hidden by the previous bug,
it might take you a week and a half to get it to run in the batch
system, while doing it interactively might have taken you 18 minutes.
In such cases, the batch system would save computer time — it would
consume perhaps 4 minutes in this case rather than 18 — at the expense
of human time.  So it paid off to be extremely cautious about
correctness, and moreover, using a time-shared (“multitasking”) system
rather than a batch system could boost your productivity by an order
of magnitude or more.</p>
<p>Time-shared operating systems got much the same computational
efficiencies as batch operating systems — while you’re sitting at your
terminal thinking about what to do next, the computer is running
someone else’s job — and much the same human efficiencies as
interactive operation without an operating system.  But they required
a terminal for each concurrent user, and when implemented with a
virtual computer per user, they also required much more memory than a
batch operating system.</p>
<p>However, even in the time-shared environment that Knuth took for
granted in the above quote, batch processing was part of the
picture — not just to use less terminals and memory, but also to
simplify the programming and make the system easier to use.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about batch processing — ignored for decades in
favor of mere economic considerations — is its <em>reproducibility</em>.  A
batch program starts up, accesses some input data, produces some
output data, and exits.  Normally, we have the guarantee that it will
produce the same output data if given the same input data (a guarantee
Knuth went to extreme lengths to provide in a cross-platform way in
TeX, for reasons of preserving access to the scholarly record) and we
can modify the input data incrementally to see what changes result.</p>
<p>Reproducibility is extremely valuable for testing and debugging, and
it’s also very useful for <em>caching</em>.  A significant fraction of
programming, perhaps the majority, consists of “optimizing” — not in
the mathematical sense of finding the minimum of a function, but in
the sense of making programs do the same thing in less time and/or
memory.  Caching — storing a previously obtained piece of data so that
it’s available again when needed — is the most important optimization
in the world, and perhaps the majority of optimizing and even software
design consists of tweaking what to cache, when, and how.</p>
<p>Reproducible computations can be cached.  Irreproducible computations
can’t.  By casting a computation into the batch-processing model,
we make it reproducible and therefore cacheable.  (Umut Acar’s
revolutionary “self-adjusting computation” work, as I understand it,
is a matter of carrying this principle down to a microscopic level.)</p>
<p>The biggest change in mainstream programming practices over the last
20 years is the near-universal adoption of automated testing, which
amounts to testing your software in batch mode, so that the test
results are reproducible, rather than interactively.</p>
<p>Batch processing doesn’t need “undo”, because it just produces output
data from input data.  If you change the input data, you get new
output data, but the old output data doesn’t disappear.  By
incrementally changing input data, we can achieve a sort of “undo and
redo” without burdening our program code with extra complexity — make
a change to a part of the input that the program accesses early, and
it’s like undoing everything the program did after that, making the
change, and then redoing all the other things in the new context.
It’s wonderful.</p>
<p>TeX users prefer to keep their interaction with TeX batch-mode because
it becomes reproducible and thus gains these flexibilities.  And TeX,
despite unusually extensive interaction facilities for a compiler,
depends on the batch-processing model — it cannot back up to a
previous page and change it, for example, or save an editable form of
a document so you can edit it again later, both of which would be core
functionality for an app-model word-processing system.  You can
write a document entirely interactively in TeX — that was the
Experiment~1 omitted from my TeXbook quote above — but it’s
impractical.</p>
<h3>The Unix shell, and software tools</h3>
<p>Shortly after the above quote from the TeXbook, there’s a note about
command lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\danger Incidentally, many systems allow you to invoke \TeX\ by
typing a one-liner like ‘<code>tex story</code>’ instead of waiting for the
‘<code>**</code>’; similarly, ‘<code>tex \relax</code>’ works for Experiment~1, and ‘<code>tex
&amp;plain story</code>’ loads the plain format before inputting the <code>story</code>
file.  You might want to try this, to see if it works on your
computer, or you might ask somebody if there’s a similar shortcut.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that, on some computers where people ran TeX, the only
way to specify input files was through the app-model interaction
described earlier, which meant that reproducing a TeX run required
a human interaction.</p>
<p>This was an affliction suffered not just by TeX but by many systems of
that time period, and indeed by many app-model programs nowadays.
(For predatory companies such as Facebook, the owner of Instagram,
this is an advantage, not a drawback, although internally they have
systems for driving the Instagram app in batch mode for testing.)</p>
<p>Unix was a new operating system designed in the 1970s and late 1960s,
using teletypes, based on a non-app, indeed anti-app, design — though
Unix itself was unredeemably interactive, most of its programs were
almost entirely batch-mode.  A Unix user in the 1970s might use dozens
of programs at different times during a session, but only <em>interact with</em> three of them —
login, the “shell” (an interpreter for an ad-hoc programming language
optimized for launching other programs) and ed, the editor.</p>
<p>In essence, the Unix shell user interface is a REPL for launching
batch jobs, and the programs are designed to be composable in useful
ways.  Unix facilitates this by allowing programs to treat other
programs’ unfinished outputs as input files, as long as they only
access them sequentially from beginning to end, a facility known as
“pipes” — the reader process falls asleep until the writer process
produces some data, just as with a disk or magnetic tape.  The stream
of input from the terminal can also be treated as an input file, and
normally is, providing a certain degree of interactivity to
normally-batch-mode programs and a certain degree of automatability to
normally-interactive programs.</p>
<p>The power of the Unix “REPL” must be put in context in its place in
the 1970s: it ran on a PDP-11, which might typically have a
quarter-megabyte of RAM, of which each process could access no more
than 64 KiB at a time.  Nevertheless, in a few seconds, you could
assemble a command line that strung together four or five processes to
use the whole quarter-megabyte of RAM to process a file of a megabyte
or more, fairly efficiently.</p>
<p>Some of the designers of Unix used the metaphor of “software tools” to
explain the difference between Unix programs and traditional
app-model programs: rather than climbing into a bulldozer to
interact with it exclusively for a while, you could pick up a shovel
in one hand while wrenches and hammers hung from your belt.  The
software-tools approach became popular with programmers on non-Unix
systems as well, but without the Unix shell and pipes, it was much
clumsier.  Too, the heavy costs of launching new programs on non-Unix
systems made the software-tools approach much less efficient than on
Unix.</p>
<p>The <code>make</code> program added to Unix in the late 1970s provides an
automatic caching system for such reproducible batch computations, the
paradigmatic example being recompiling a file of source code and
relinking an executable when that file has changed.  With <code>make</code>, the
invocations of the compiler are usually automatic.  You can also use
it to cache a wide variety of staged data processing.</p>
<p>The architecture of the Unix C compiler itself also took advantage of
the pipe facility to separate a macro preprocessor, the compiler as
such, and the assembler into separate concurrent processes, making C
considerably more expressive than other minicomputer programming
languages of the 1970s.</p>
<p>After a few years, the “C shell” from Berkeley added filename
completion and command-line editing to the Unix “REPL”, enabling
incremental cut-and-try construction of command lines.  As an example,
in my shell history on this laptop, I have the following sequence as I
incrementally excluded more types of files from my command-line
listing:</p>
<pre><code>ls
ls | grep -v 'mkv$|vtt$'
ls | egrep -v 'mkv$|vtt$'
ls | egrep -v 'mkv$|vtt$|webm$'
ls | egrep -v 'mkv$|vtt$|webm$|mp4$'
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ls</code> and <code>egrep</code> programs need not be interactive to support this
kind of incremental experimentation; they need only take their input
from the Unix shell command line rather than interactively.</p>
<p>The C shell also added “job control”, which allows a user using a
teletype-emulating terminal to switch back and forth between one or
more interactive apps and the shell, just as a GUI windowing system
does.</p>
<p>The Unix shell, however, suffers some serious weaknesses.  It’s almost
useless for anything involving graphics, although you can do things
like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ gnuplot -e 'set term dumb size 60,15; plot x**2'

  100 **+----------+-----------+------------+---------+**   
   90 +**          +           +            +         **+   
   80 +-**                                 x**2 *******-+   
   70 +-+ **                                       ** +-+

     -10          -5           0            5           10
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of drawing blocky ASCII art, gnuplot can write your plot to a
file or open it in a window, but in neither case do you get the
alternating list of queries and answers you normally get in a REPL
typescript.</p>
<p>The shell is also useless for anything that requires feedback with
latency under a second, like adjusting spline control points of a
vector graphic.</p>
<p>Finally, the shell typescript session inevitably contains errors and
false starts mixed in indiscriminately with the actual useful results,
limiting the usefulness of the typescript without further editing.  On
a teletype this was inevitable, but not on a computer screen.</p>
<h3>Notebooks</h3>
<p>Like most fashionable programmers, I do a lot of my work nowadays in IPython
notebooks (more recently renamed Jupyter notebooks).  These are
Python REPL transcripts enhanced with a few major features:</p>
<ol>
<li>As in the Unix shell or the Python REPL, you can edit previous
   command lines.  Unlike those systems, by default, the edited
   version replaces the original, and its output also replaces the
   original output.  If you want both versions in your notebook, you
   can copy and paste into a new “cell”.</li>
<li>The output from the command lines is not restricted to being text.
   It can include graphics, TeX markup for equations, and data tables,
   and often does.  In fact, it can even support further graphical
   interaction through callbacks.</li>
<li>Because the input and the output are distinguished — although they
   alternate, as in traditional REPL transcripts — it’s possible to
   re-execute some or all of the cells with new input data, or to
   attempt to reproduce the results after an incremental change.  You
   can think of the contents of each cell as the input to a batch job.
   Reproducibility is fairly limited, though, for a variety of
   reasons.  First, the IPython session state is an additional,
   invisible, constantly-changing input to the “batch job”.  Second,
   the installed software and filesystem state are also potentially
   inputs, and they are also invisible and potentially changing.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also invoke other programming languages (including the Unix
shell), include comments in Markdown with LaTeX equations, and a few
other things, but those are not the most important advantages over the
bare Unix shell in a terminal.</p>
<p>That is, the notebook is an alternative model for interacting with and
integrating programs, different from apps, REST, batch processing, and
teletype REPLs including the Unix shell.</p>
<h3>The open operating system model</h3>
<p>Before proceeding to talk about the new interaction model I’m exploring,
I want to point out a few significant systems that don’t fit into the
above interaction models: Smalltalk, Emacs, Cedar, and Oberon.  In these
systems, many separately developed “programs” are loaded into the same
memory space and can interact with one another using function calls, and
the user can interact with them by invoking functions from any of them
at any time, and can also load more programs.</p>
<p>In Smalltalk, the system developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s in which
object-orientation was invented, not only each window on the screen but
each letter is an object, which is to say, a tiny virtual computer with
its own code and state, and each window’s code decides how to display it
and how to react to events such as clicks.  The difference from the apps
model is that there’s no separation between the windows — it’s trivial
to embed one “program” in another, call functions of one “program” from
another, pass complex data objects from one “program” to another, and so
on — like Windows OLE, but simple.</p>
<p>Cedar is a system developed at Xerox PARC in the late 1970s and early
1980s as a sort of improved alternative to Smalltalk and Interlisp, but
with strong static typing and separate compilation.  Cedar is not as well
known as Smalltalk, in part because the software was never published,
but <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1773#comment-21567">its successor language</a> Oak is unfortunately extremely popular.</p>
<p>After spending a couple of sabbatical years at Xerox PARC
working on Cedar and its predecessor Mesa, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9847955">Wirth
went back to Switzerland and, with Gutknecht and others,
wrote his own version of it from scratch</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.90.7173&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" title="Oberon — The Overlooked Jewel">starting in 1988</a>,
based on his language Modula-3; this system is called Oberon, and it is
free software.</p>
<p>XXX Inferno?</p>
<p>Emacs also uses this interaction model.  Emacs Lisp is not
object-oriented, but it has the notions of “major modes”, “minor modes”,
“keymaps”, and “buffer-local variables”, which permit different windows
to respond differently to interaction; and there are a number of popular
programs written in Emacs Lisp, including Org-mode, Gnus, Magit, Eshell,
Ediff, and Hyperbole, in addition to the basic IDE functionality Emacs
was written for.  Although Emacs has been suffering substantially in
popularity in recent years, some of these programs are, or once were,
best-in-class applications.</p>
<p>Lampson and Sproull published a 1979 paper in which they called a
version of this system architecture an “open operating system” or
“open system”, a term which has been reused for other purposes; they
emphasized other aspects.</p>
<h2>Mummified embedded apps</h2>
<p>With that background out of the way, I’ve been hacking on Yeso, a simple
framebuffer graphics input-output library, with the purpose of making it
easy and direct to write graphical programs in any language that run
pixel-identically on a variety of platforms.  So far I only have X11 and
Linux framebuffer console backends, but one of the next things I want to
write for it is Wercam, a display server that uses Yeso itself, rather
like Xnest, 8½, or Rio — it will allow Yeso apps to connect to it using
a simple protocol and draw windows on its screen, and route events to
them as appropriate.</p>
<p>This led me to ask: what kind of window management should it use?
Should it use overlapping windows, like X, or alternate between giving
different apps full control of the screen, like Android and IOS normally
do?</p>
<p>And, of course, I’d been using notebooks for years, and Perry Lorier
told me about a notebook-style shell he’s writing using curses.  Unlike
Jupyter/IPython, in which only one cell can be evaluating at a time
(except that they can respond to callbacks), in his notebook-shell, each
process gets its own pseudo-terminal, and it can continue running freely
while you’re interacting with other processes.</p>
<p>So it occurred to me that maybe the window manager should be such a
notebook-shell.  If you start a program and it merely produces textual
output and takes textual input, that would appear underneath your
command, as per normal; but if a program opens a Yeso window, the window
would be embedded in the notebook there, by default.  Perry’s
notebook-shell takes a program full-screen when it issues a clear-screen
escape sequence; perhaps some similar action would be useful.</p>
<p>The Yeso calling interface is in rapid flux, changing about once a day
for the last three weeks, but putting a colored rectangle on the screen
can be done in C something like this:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;yeso.h&gt;

int main()
{
  yeso w = yb_open("hola, mundo!", 64, 64, "");
  yi_fill(yb_framebuffer(w), 0xcc99cc);
  yb_flip(w);
  for (;;) yb_wait(w, 0);
}
</code></pre>
<p>On the Linux framebuffer console backend, that last line is somewhat
unnecessary; it just makes the program hang until you kill it.  On the
X11 backend, it’s kind of mandatory, because otherwise the window closes
immediately as the program exits; it probably won’t even be on the
screen long enough for a screen refresh.</p>
<p>But preserving output from programs that are no longer running is sort
of the sine qua non of REPLs and notebook interfaces.  Maybe if Wercam
uses a notebook interface for its window management, it should preserve
the graphical output of the program, just as IPython preserves the
graphical output of matplotlib plot commands that have plotted data.
(Unless the user deletes them.)  Wercam could actually do better than
just save the last frame of output — because Yeso sends a sequence of
full frames to the display, Wercam could record all the frames (up to
some limit, by default) and allow you to fast-forward and rewind through
the impromptu screencast.</p>
<h4>Horcruxes or continuations</h4>
<p>Having graphical output there in the notebook without a running process
behind every scatterplot seems useful.  But what if you want to zoom in
on one of those plots later?  How can you supply event-handling
callbacks without a running IPython kernel or other process sitting
there waiting to answer them?</p>
<p>Well, in the early days of the Web, clicking a link might launch a CGI
program to generate the response document.  Wercam could do something
similar.  What if the program left behind at its exit not only an image
but also a sort of last will and testament, or perhaps a horcrux, giving
a command to run to handle any new events, and perhaps a set of event
types to ignore, such as mouse movements?</p>
<p>(Of course, for security reasons, that command should run only with the
authority of the original program.)</p>
<p>At one point it would have been absurd to spawn a new Unix process for
each mouse movement — it just took far too long.  But my <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/forkovh.c">forkovh
test</a> on my laptop takes about 130 μs to fork a child process,
written in C, which immediately dies, and then reap it.  And
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/httpdito-readme">httpdito</a> takes about 30–50 μs to accept a connection, fork a child
process, and then reap it.  (The children handle HTTP requests, but that
mostly happens on other cores.)  Httpdito is faster probably because
it’s not linked with the C library, so its memory map is much smaller.
Linking forkovh with glibc boosts its latency to 670 μs.</p>
<p>Exec is significantly more expensive, although possibly a better
operating system would help.  Forking, executing, and waiting for a
hello-world C program takes about 3 ms with glibc on my laptop (whether
statically or dynamically linked), or 2 ms with dietlibc.  On the Linux
framebuffer, the Yeso PNG viewer takes 4 ms on small images.  (Pentium
N3700 1.6GHz at probably 500 MHz, Linux debian 4.4.0-21-generic #37-Ubuntu.)</p>
<p>These latency numbers are not insignificant, but on a 60fps display like
the one on my laptop, 2 milliseconds out of a 16.7 ms frame is not
immediately fatal.  I mean, USB mice are normally polled every 10
milliseconds, and 1 millisecond is the shortest polling interval USB
supports.</p>
<p>But suppose respawning the program when there’s an input event, or maybe
even after a specified timeout, is fast enough at the kernel level.  Now
the program needs to know the “session state” — if it’s redrawing a
scatterplot in response to a zoom, for example, it needs to know the
data points and plot colors.  If it’s an interpreter, it needs the
parsed program.  If it’s a PDF viewer that renders nearby pages in the
background to avoid delays, it needs access to the prerendered cache.
And it needs all of this without having to redo precious milliseconds of
deserialization every time.</p>
<p>It turns out that arrays of binary integers or floating-point numbers,
written to files in native byte order, and memory-mapped, works really
well for this kind of thing.  On my laptop, <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/mmapovh.c">mmap() on an already-open
file takes about 4–6 μs</a>.  For more elaborately structured data,
something like FlatBuffers, CapnProto, or SBE enables you to get
similarly zippy speeds without having to pay a startup deserialization
tax.</p>
<p>So perhaps the “session state” or “horcrux” in the notebook cell should
be a filesystem directory with the crucial state saved in files that the
program knows to open and map into its memory when restarted;
essentially they are a mummified version of the live program’s
non-ephemeral memory state, ready for instant rehydration and return to
life.  This is pretty similar to how Android saves the state of an
Activity (an app, in Androidese) in a “bundle” in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)">onSaveInstanceState</a> and then passes that bundle to onCreate when it
restarts the Activity; but Android “flattens” whatever you put into the
bundle into a “parcel”, which is extra overhead that should probably be
avoided in this context.</p>
