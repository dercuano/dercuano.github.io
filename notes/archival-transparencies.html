(7 minutes)</div><p>I've written before a bit about "transparency holograms" and how they
might be useful as an archival medium for text.  Here I want to do
some calculations on that.</p>
<p>Let's suppose we're printing out on both sides of a 4-mil (102μm)
Mylar transparency foil, using the simple grille pattern where all but
one pixel is blacked out in each N×N square; I'll take N to be 7 in
this case, and assume 600dpi, so the grille has a hole spacing of
7"/600 = 296μm, or 85.7 dpi.  The other side of the foil has the
pixels of 49 different 85.7 dpi pages interleaved.  (For the moment
I'll assume this is for a viewing distance of infinity.)</p>
<p>If we use a 6-pixel-tall font for text, which works out to 5.04 points
at 85.7 dpi, each of the 49 pages has space for 157 rather long lines
of text, about 208 characters each if we assume an average of 3.5
pixels.  (I don't remember if this is the right average from
bible-columns.png.)  That's about 1.6 megabytes of text on the
transparency, and it should all be visible to the naked eye, hopefully.</p>
<p>Do the viewing angles work out?  The angle between two pages needs to
not be impracticably small, and the angle for the most extreme left,
right, top, or bottom page needs to not be impracticably large.
Mylar's index of refraction is about 1.6, so those 101.6 microns are,
optically speaking, closer to 63.5 microns.  But our 600dpi page has
42.3μm pixel spacing, which means that we have to go 25° to the left,
right, up, or down to see the next pixel in that direction: 20 cm to
the side at a viewing distance of 50 cm.  The refraction linearizes
this somewhat, so the next page is closer to being 20 cm further to
the side than to being 25° further; about 60cm to the side gets you to
the third page.  So we can do 7×7 without extremely distorted viewing
angles—barely!  At the extreme corners of viewing angle, the page is
foreshortened by 36% in both X and Y dimensions.</p>
<p>So at 600dpi on heavy-duty transparency film, it's barely doable; at
1200dpi it's eminently doable, with more like 6 megabytes of text per
page; at 300dpi you would need thicker transparency film.</p>
<p>14-mil (356μm) and 7-mil (178μm) Mylar sheets are sold as art supplies
for making stencils, pre-frosted on one or both sides, even.  This
would work even with a 300dpi printer, but necessarily with a wider
grille spacing.  "Matte Dura-Lar" is one brand name for double-frosted
Mylar.  "Drafting film" is another way this kind of thing is sold.  I
suspect that clear film will work better, though.  Grafix, the
manufacturer of Dura-Lar, claims that neither inkjet nor laser will
print on Dura-Lar, but other people claim success with inkjet, while
claiming that the laser-printer heat curls up Mylar.</p>
<p>A related idea: shrink film, like Shrinky-Dinks, might enhance the
resolution of a printer at the same time as thickening the film; it
shrinks 2:1 when heated, which should quadruple its thickness,
initially 254μm.  But I don't know if it's available in transparent,
and it's made of polystyrene, which is apparently not archival-safe if
exposed to ultraviolet or, maybe, oxygen.  However, it seems that
polystyrene's better-knn problem is that it's so stable that it can
last a long time after being discarded, resisting biodegradation and
photodegradation for up to centuries.  (Obviously you can't put shrink
film through a laser printer.)</p>
<p>Mechanically, though, polystyrene is far, far more fragile than PET.
PET stick-on films are used to make windows smash-resistant and even
mildly bullet-resistant.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, polycarbonate ("bulletproof glass")
can be recovered from CDs, and is, ounce for ounce, less fragile than
almost anything, although it has a weakness for ammonia and other
alkalis.  Melting CDs also causes them to shrink, just like
polystyrene shrink film; but they're optically clear.  It's also an
archival-stable plastic.</p>
<h2>A test</h2>
<p>I snarfed rosettaproject_zul_gen-1.pdf (SHA1
296b27e22a720a8d3c10fa971d262f798b27906d) from
<a href="https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_zul_gen-1">https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_zul_gen-1</a> and converted
it first to PS with pdf2ps, then to 100dpi PNGs.  GhostScript by
default just does point sampling rather than antialiasing, which is
shitty and loses parts of letters entirely when rendering bitmaps at
low resolution, so I antialiased by brute force with ImageMagick:</p>
<pre><code>time gs -dNOPAUSE -r300 \
    -sOutputFile=rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p%d.png \
    -sDEVICE=pnggray -dBATCH rosettaproject_zul_gen-1.ps 
time for x in rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p*; do
    mogrify -scale 827x1169! -threshold 90% "$x"
done
</code></pre>
<p>827×1169 is from <code>units A4paper</code> telling me A4 is 210mm by 297mm, and
that those work out to be 827 and 1169 pixels respectively at 100dpi.
The <code>!</code> is to indicate that the images are to be stretched and
squeezed as necessary to make them fit, because by default ImageMagick
preserves aspect ratios and doesn't fit the box.  The <code>-threshold</code>
option is to convert the image to bilevel, while dilating the
letterforms somewhat to keep any lines from getting lost.</p>
<p>Anyway, then I use the <code>interleave.py</code> I just wrote using PIL;
unfortunately this is only 5 pages, so to get to 3×3, I had to
duplicate some.</p>
<pre><code>time ./interleave.py \
    rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p1.png\
    rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p2.png\
    rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p3.png\
    \
    rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p4.png\
    rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p5.png\
    rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p5.png\
    \
    rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p5.png\
    rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p5.png\
    rosettaproject_zul_gen-1-large-p5.png
mv interleave-output.png bible-zulu-interleaved.png
</code></pre>
<p><code>interleave.py</code> took like 3½ minutes to do this, and the result looks
okay.</p>
<p>(Now I guess I need to turn that into a PDF so I can print it, plus
printing the grille.)</p>
<p>My theory on the numbers on this prototype is that, even if the number
of pages changes, the size of the composite pixels shouldn't; there
should still be about 86 of them per inch in each direction.  This
image has 100 of them per inch in each direction, and only 9 pages;
this should be less challenging in the dimensions of legibility,
viewing angle delta, brightness, and maximum viewing angle.</p>
<p>A thing that surprised me about this, but shouldn't have, is that some
of the text is readable without the grille.  In particular, since page
5 is repeated 5 times, it's quite readable despite the other four page
images interfering.</p>
<h2>A second test</h2>
<p>I downloaded Murray R. Spiegel's "Mathematical Handbook of Formulas
and Tables" from
<a href="https://archive.org/details/MathematicalHandbookOfFormulasAndTables">https://archive.org/details/MathematicalHandbookOfFormulasAndTables</a>
(SHA1 efc83d86ae251e4ef7bf6ec852caeb95708ba98d) and extracted pp. 27,
28, 30, 31, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 43 with Evince's "print; range;
pages" to a PDF file.  Then I processed this into PNGs:</p>
<pre><code>time gs -dNOPAUSE -r300 -sOutputFile=spiegel-select-p%d.png \
    -sDEVICE=pnggray -dBATCH ~/Documents/spiegel-select.pdf
time for x in spiegel-select-p*; do
    mogrify -scale 827x1169! -threshold 70% "$x"
done
</code></pre>
<p>The 90% threshold came out shitty because this book contains gray
halftoning with super important black text in it, but a 50% threshold
washes out the text badly.  70% was better than either 66% or 75%,
although it still has some problems.</p>
<pre><code>time ./interleave.py spiegel-select-p*
mv interleave-output.png spiegel-interleaved.png
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to have worked pretty well.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
