(20 minutes)</div><p>I was reading a book on digital signal processing (the highly readable
if occasionally inaccurate and somewhat outdated <em>Guide to Digital
Signal Processing for Scientists and Engineers</em>
<a href="http://www.dspguide.com/">http://www.dspguide.com/</a>), and it seemed to me that the available
types of digital filters leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>FIR filters are the most popular because you can design them by
Fourier-transforming your desired frequency response to get an impulse
response, then windowing the impulse response to get a finite-size
convolution kernel.  Windowing with the popular Blackman or Hamming
windows only screws up your frequency response slightly.  The trouble
is that your convolution kernel may be dozens to hundreds of samples
wide, so you end up doing dozens to hundreds of multiply-accumulates
if you compute the convolution in the time domain; and to do it in the
frequency domain, you need to do the FFT, which also involves
typically dozens of multiply-accumulates per sample.</p>
<p>IIR filters are technically a superset of FIR filters, but people
usually design them by transforming well-known analog filters (like
the classic Butterworth or Bessel filters) into the discrete domain,
which is very limiting.  Additionally, the typical design technique
using the Z-transform requires that the filter itself be linear and
stateless, with each output sample being a linear combination of the P
previous input samples and the Q previous output samples.</p>
<p>In passing, the moving-average filter was mentioned as being much
faster to compute, since it requires only an addition and a
subtraction per sample, optimal for suppressing noise while preserving
edge sharpness, and producing a good approximation of convolution with
a Gaussian when iterated.</p>
<p>So some ideas occurred to me, which might or might not be good ones,
but I thought I'd write them down anyway.</p>
<h2>Square-wave filters</h2>
<p>The discrete Fourier transform transforms your given samples onto a
basis space of orthonormal sinusoids, enabling you to, among other
things, measure the amplitude of individual frequencies, or multiply
them by a desired frequency response curve before transforming them
back into the time domain with an inverse discrete Fourier transform
(a filter).</p>
<p>But many other sets of orthonormal basis functions are possible: the
Hadamard–Walsh functions, unit impulses (which yields the identity
transform), an infinite variety of wavelets, windowed sinusoids (the
short-time Fourier transform), the Gabor basis function (the Gabor
transform happens to be a special case of the STFT and also, I
believe, the wavelet transform), and so on.</p>
<p>The Hadamard–Walsh functions are particularly interesting because
there's an O(N log N) algorithm to compute the Hadamard or Walsh
transform, using only addition and subtraction, because the basis
functions have the range {-1, 1}, with no fractions, and are related
to each other in a particular way that enables the fast Hadamard
transform to work.</p>
<p>But most of the Hadamard–Walsh functions are not particularly close to
being sine waves, so they are of limited usefulness if you want to
filter particular frequencies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have a square wave of some frequency f, it's
pretty strongly correlated with a sine wave of frequency f with the
right phase, and it's perfectly uncorrelated with most other sine
waves.  However, it does have a largish correlation with the odd
harmonics of the original sine wave, with frequencies 3f, 5f, 7f, and
so on; its correlations with them are 1/3, 1/5, 1/7, etc., of the
original.  (So far this is just the standard Fourier analysis of a
square wave, seen from the perspective of the square wave.)</p>
<p>This same property means that a comprehensive set of square waves is
not an orthogonal basis, since some of its elements are correlated, if
imperfectly, and thus not orthogonal.  This, in turn, means that you
can't simply transform a signal into a weighted sum of square waves by
correlating it (i.e. taking the dot product) with each square wave.</p>
<p>But suppose you just want to compute the energy in a given time span
at a given frequency f?  You could take the correlation with a square
wave sq(f, t) of frequency f and subtract off the other square waves
until you've approximated a sine to your sampling interval:
sq(3f, t)/3 + sq(5f, t)/5 + sq(7f, t)/7, etc.  If you can low-pass
filter the signal before you do this, even crudely (say, with a
moving-average or simple exponential filter), then you can probably
quit pretty early.</p>
<p>(You probably want to do this twice, once for sq(f, t) and its
"harmonics", and once for sq(f, t + 1/2f) and its "harmonics", so you
can catch a wave that's out of phase.)</p>
<p>Why should you care when the DFT is already O(N log N)
multiply-accumulates?  Because you can do this faster than O(N log N),
without multipliers, and without using memory to store the samples, if
you don't want too many frequencies.</p>
<p>If you only want a <em>single</em> square wave correlation, of course, you
can simply add or subtract each sample to the total as it comes in,
according to whether sq(f, t) is 1 or -1 at that moment.  But doing
that for M square waves means doing M additions or subtractions per
sample.  Instead, use a sum table, also known as a summed-area table
or integral image: s[t] = sum(x[0:t]), where 0:t includes 0 but not t,
so sum(x[t0:t1]) = s[t1] - s[t0].  So if your square wave is 1 from
sample t0 to sample t1, you can add s[t1] - s[t0] to your running sum;
and if it's -1 from sample t1 to sample t2, you can add s[t1] - s[t2].
You might as well add 2s[t1] on the negative-going transition at t1 in
the first place, and later subtract 2s[t2] at the positive-going
transition at t2, and so on.  And you don't need to actually do the
doubling at the time; you can wait until you're inspecting the final
sum before remembering that you need to double it.</p>
<p>This, of course, doesn't require that you actually store the sum
table, just that you compute the values in it.  This requires one
addition per sample, plus one addition or subtraction per square-wave
transition.</p>
<p>If you decide to do this calculation for all the N square waves that
would correspond to the sinusoids needed for N samples, the waves will
have numbers of transitions ranging linearly from 0 to N, with an
average of about N/2, so you'd end up doing N/2 additions or
subtractions per sample --- definitely worse than Hadamard–Walsh (as
long as N/2 &gt; lg N, which is true for N&gt;4) and possibly worse than the
DFT, depending on how much multiplies cost you.  But maybe you need
less than lg N square waves, or maybe the ones you want are of
lower-than-average frequency.  Most of the high-frequency square waves
here will have substantial phase noise induced by quantization which
will degrade their performance anyway.</p>
<p>You might be able to avoid doing some of this work by taking advantage
of the fact that it's duplicate work in the case of harmonics.
Consider the square wave with period 30, which means it has two
transitions every 30 samples.  The square wave with period 10 has six
transitions every 30 samples, but two of them are the same as the
period-30 one; that is, you could compute both the period-10 and
period-30 square waves with only 6 transitions, rather than 8.
Similarly, the period-6 square wave has 10 transitions in this period,
but shares the two of the period-30 wave, so you could compute all
three with only 14 transitions, rather than 18.  I'm not sure how
practical this is; it reminds me of the wheel optimization for probing
possible composites in the Sieve of Eratosthenes.</p>
<p>A difficulty is that, of course, the difference between square waves
and sine waves has more energy below the Nyquist frequency, or any
given filter cutoff frequency, for lower-frequency waves.  But perhaps
you can do better.  The procedure I described above for correlating
with the square waves is equivalent to integrating the input signal,
once, and correlating it with a train of alternating positive and
negative impulses, the derivative of the square wave.  The integral of
a square wave is a triangle wave, which is much closer to being a sine
wave, and the integral of a triangle wave is a wave made of parabolas,
which is a piecewise second-order approximation to a sine wave, and
actually has almost all of its energy in that frequency; and you can
iterate the procedure N times to get an Nth-order approximation of a
sine wave.</p>
<p>So perhaps you could integrate the input signal N times, making an
Nth-order sum table (materialized or virtual), and correlate that with
your square waves, or rather, your impulse trains.  One potential
difficulty is that this corresponds to a pretty heavy-duty low-pass
filter, and so it will be necessary to introduce a corresponding
high-pass filter at each stage, if nothing else to prevent any initial
DC offset, or any introduced later as a constant of integration, from
causing the procedure to diverge entirely.  A difference in frequency
of one octave will show up as a difference in magnitude of 2 after one
stage of integration, of 4 after two stages, of 8 after three stages,
and of 16 after four stages.  Of course, in a sense, that's exactly
what we <em>want</em> it to do; but roundoff error could be a problem very
quickly.</p>
<h2>Magic sinewave filters</h2>
<p>Don Lancaster has been writing about a set of functions he calls
"magic sinewaves", which are periodic functions with the range
{-1, 0, 1} that approximate sinewaves, with the purpose of improving
power electronics by replacing simple PWM with lower-distortion
waveforms.  Of course, they have very substantial power outside the
desired frequency --- the same as a PWM waveform, I think --- but the
idea is that if you push that power to a high enough frequency, it's
much more practical to filter it, using an analog filter with a slower
rolloff and physically smaller components.</p>
<p>You can also use this idea in reverse: take your input signal and
correlate it with a magic sinewave, rather than a real sinewave, thus
avoiding multiplication entirely.  For accurate results, you need to
prefilter the signal to eliminate the high harmonics, but you can do
this with a simple, easy-to-compute filter, such as a moving-average
filter.</p>
<h2>Parallelizing IIR filters</h2>
<p>Parallelizing an M-sample FIR filter is easy: split your input into
windows that overlap by M samples, filter each one independently, and
concatenate the results.  But how can you parallelize an IIR filter?</p>
<p>Consider the sum table, which is a simple IIR filter; it amounts to
convolving a step function with your input.  It's simple and efficient
to calculate a sum table serially, but how could you parallelize it,
since the last output value depends on every value before it?</p>
<p>I think I've written about this before on kragen-tol, but the answer
is basically that it's easy, because addition is a monoid; this is the
approach taken by lookahead carry in digital logic, too.  If you break
your input into four equal segments 0:t1, t1:t2, t2:t3, and t3:n, and
compute the sum table s0[a:b] for each segment independently (in
parallel), you can then use the final sum of each segment to adjust
the sums of the other segments, again independently and in parallel:
s[0:t1] = s0[0:t1], while s[t1:t2] = s[t1] + s0[t1:t2], s[t2:t3] =
s[t2] + s0[t2:t3], and s[t3:n] = s[t3] + s0[t3:n].  You can apply this
division of the process recursively (or with a branching factor of
other than 4, although a branching factor of more than √n is unlikely
to be an improvement) to get an O(log N) time algorithm.</p>
<p>(This is the well-known "parallel prefix sum" problem.)</p>
<p><em>General</em> IIR filters are impossible to parallelize.  But the IIR
filters in common usage are purely linear and dependent on a limited
amount of past history, so you can do the same thing: filter each
segment independently, then add in the linear contribution from the
prefix to its left.</p>
<h2>Factoring FIR kernels approximately into sparse FIR kernels</h2>
<p>Convolution with a Gaussian is potentially computationally expensive.
But N iterations of a moving-average filter give you a piecewise
Nth-order approximation of a Gaussian, and the moving-average filter
is really cheap to compute.</p>
<p>In general the expense of convolving with a FIR kernel in the discrete
time domain is expensive in proportion to its <em>support</em>, that is, the
number of points where it's nonzero.  But what if you could factor a
256-point FIR kernel into a convolution of two 16-point FIR kernels?
You could compute it four times faster.  That's doable in at least
some special cases; the Gaussian mentioned above is an example
(although the moving average has a recursive algorithm that's more
efficient than just doing it as a FIR convolution in the time domain),
since actually iterating just about any FIR kernel enough times will
give you a Gaussian (e.g. [1, 1], whose iterative convolution
generates the rows of Pascal's triangle; but I suspect that [1, 0, 0,
0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] might be a better
compute/quality tradeoff for larger Gaussians).  But consider these
examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exact factorization of a finite comb: a comb of N equally-spaced
  impulses can be factored into one P-impulse kernel for each prime
  factor P of N.  For example, a 16-impulse comb can be factored into
  four two-impulse kernels, with the impulses at distances 1, 2, 4,
  and 8 times the spacing of the impulses in the desired comb; or a
  20-impulse comb can be factored into two two-impulse combs and a
  five-impulse comb.  (In the special case of a composition of two
  two-impulse combs, it's probably advantageous to preconvolve them
  into a single four-impulse comb.  The optimum number of impulses per
  kernel, to keep multiply-accumulates to a minimum, is 3.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exact factorization of exponential decay: for N points, compose
  log(N) two-point FIR kernels whose points are spaced at powers of 2,
  whose first point is 1 and whose other point is exponentially
  decayed from 1 according to its spacing.  This happens to be exact.
  This is sort of stupid, though, because you can compute exponential
  decay even more efficiently with an IIR filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approximation with a sum of equal-width Gaussians: use one sparse
  kernel with an impulse indicating the center and amplitude of each
  Gaussian, then one or more FIR kernels, or the moving-average
  technique, to convolve the result with the desired Gaussian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exact factorization of a periodic signal: factor into a kernel
  representing a single period and a comb kernel (itself perhaps
  factored as above) with one impulse for each period, in order to
  copy each period into its desired place.  If the period is itself a
  repetition of the same signal twice, but once inverted, you can use
  an additional kernel with a 1 and a -1 impulse to halve the number
  of points.  Composed with a Gaussian window, this should give you a
  fairly efficient way to do FIR bandpass filters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approximate Gaussians --- although this is not the right way to do
  it, convolve(convolve(convolve(convolve([1, 1,1], [1, 1, 1]), [1, 0,
  1,0, 1]), [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]), [1, 0, 0, 1]) is quite close to
  convolve(convolve(convolve([1,1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1]), [1,1,1,1,1]),
  [1,1,1,1,1]), requiring 14 additions rather than 20.  (The recursive
  algorithm using a fourth-order moving average, though, requires only
  8.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The well-known "convolution by separability" technique used in image
  processing, in which you factor a separable kernel into a vertical
  component and a vertical component, is a special case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a general technique to find such an approximate factorization
into sparse kernels for any desired impulse response?  Here's one
guess: tabulate the frequency responses for some "basis set" of sparse
kernels, then use a greedy algorithm to iteratively pick the ones that
best suppress the largest difference between the frequency response of
your current set of filters and the frequency response you want.</p>
<p>There's a paper this year from Aimin Jiang and Hon Keung Kwan on the
subject that I haven't read, using weighted least squares (WLS); but
it sounds from the abstract like they're talking about approximating
one FIR filter kernel with another, sparser one, not factoring one
into possibly several.</p>
<p>How small do these factors need to be?  The competition is FFT
convolution, which, if I understand correctly requires computing a
DFT, pointwise complex multiplication, and computing an inverse DFT.
Each DFT requires N lg N butterflies, each of which requires one
complex multiplication and two complex additions or subtractions.  One
complex multiplication requires four real multiplications.  So we have
2 × 4 × N lg N real multiplications, or 8 lg N real multiplications
per point, plus some other overhead work which is mostly proportional.
FFT convolution isn't worthwhile unless lg N is at least 6, at which
point you're paying 48 real multiplications per point (which is why it
isn't useful for smaller N); if lg N is 7, 8, 9, or 10, you're paying
56, 64, 72, or 80 real multiplications per point.</p>
<p>Probably close to the best you can do for a filter kernel with N-point
support is 3 log₃N multiply-accumulates per point, which is only
slightly lower than 2 lg N, although in some cases maybe you can get
by without the multiplications.  2 lg N is substantially less than
8 lg N, and furthermore the N you use in the FFT is going to be around
two or three times the size of the kernel, so there's some hope that
this algorithm could maybe do a reasonable job</p>
<h2>IIR: the undiscovered country</h2>
<p>Basically we know that IIR filters can always be more computationally
efficient than FIR filters, sometimes dramatically; but we don't have
a good theory of how to design them.  There are probably a lot of
tasty morsels hiding in IIR-space.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
