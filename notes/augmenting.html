(25 minutes)</div><p>My commentaries on reading Engelbart’s 1962 “Augmenting Human
Intellect: A Conceptual Framework” for the first time, rather
belatedly in 2018.</p>
<p>The date 1962 is rather crucial in understanding this work, because he
talks a lot about computers, and computers were changing rapidly
around this time.  1962 is the same year Sutherland
(mentioned on p. 72) wrote Sketchpad,
published in 1963, in which he invented graphical user interfaces,
object-oriented programming, computer-aided design, and
constraint-based programming, for example; and 1962 is the year IBM
published their book on Project Stretch, edited by Werner Buchholz,
which ran from 1954 to 1961.  The first integrated circuits were
fabricated around this time, the first real compilers were written in
the years 1958–9, and the Lisp paper was published in 1959, based on
an implementation on a vacuum-tube IBM computer.  DEC had just been
founded, and Spacewar! had just been written.  The IBM 360 project,
with its ambition to unify “business” and “scientific” computing on a
single general-purpose computer, had not yet begun.  Timesharing
operating systems, like compilers, was an avant-garde
technique — Stretch was designed for timesharing operating systems,
but most computers did not use them, or indeed any operating system.
Nowadays instead of “timesharing” we call it “multitasking”.</p>
<p>(I am not sure when Expensive Typewriter, the first interactive word
processor, was written.)</p>
<p>In short, this report was published immediately after the creation of
the compiler, the high-level programming language (“problem-oriented
language (e.g., ALGOL or COBOL)”, p. 17), the computer game, the
operating system, and multitasking (“what is known as ‘time sharing’”,
p. 70), and immediately before the publication of the graphical user
interface and object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Moreover, this was three years after Sputnik, and airlines had just
started flying jet airplanes ten years before,
adding a new increment in human
velocity to some 300 m/s (600 mph in archaic units), up from the 8 m/s
that had reigned from the domestication of the horse until the
introduction of the automobile seven decades earlier; supersonic jets
were being flown by the military, but the Concorde wouldn’t offer
passenger supersonic service until 1976.
In retrospect, the continuous, spectacular increase in human velocity
Engelbart could look back on ended almost precisely in 1962, with the
exception of a few dozen astronauts.</p>
<p>This was also the time period when full automation was being touted as
an imminent end to work as such, before the difficulties of robotics
were appreciated.  Engelbart doesn’t mention this directly, but his
report is part of the same intellectual ferment that sprang up to try
to make sense of the possibilities of the new technologies.</p>
<p>Given this atmosphere of radical ferment, it’s interesting that a
significant part of Engelbart’s paper (pp. 48–56) is dedicated to
discussing “As We May Think”, published in 1945, 17 years earlier;
Engelbart quotes its description of the Memex in its entirety.  I’m
not sure when Engelbart came upon the paper (and I missed my
opportunity to ask him) but that 17-year gap is notable.  He cites
Licklider’s “Man-Computer Symbiosis”, various list-processing things
(including IPL-V and LISP 1.5, on pp. 65–66), and a couple of items in
passing from Ross Ashby, but in nothing like the depth he dedicates to
the Memex.</p>
<p>Engelbart’s famous “Mother of all Demos” in 1968 was the result of six
years of work at SRI attempting to realize the vision he set out in
this 1962 report.</p>
<h2>Are we augmented yet?</h2>
<p>On p. 3, Engelbart explicitly cites the velocity progress I mention
above as his antecedent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is no particular reason not to expect gains in personal
intellectual effectiveness from a concerted system-oriented approach
that compare to those made in personal geographic mobility since
horseback and sailboat days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leads me to ask, 56 years later, have we achieved those gains?
Can I do intellectual things now that would have taken 150 people to
do in 1962, or can I do things now in a day that would have taken me
four to six months then?</p>
<p>In a few domains, I think I can.  In purely calculational terms, I
have balanced on my paunch a laptop capable of about a hundred billion
multiplies per second; its RAM is 4 gibibytes with a memcpy speed of
about 2 gigabytes per second (4 gigabytes/second or 32 gigabits/second
unidirectional), and its SSD holds 100 gigabytes of data and can be
read at 75 megabytes per second (600 megabits per second).  Stretch’s
disk was 8 megabits per second, or 125 000 64-bit words per second,
with a total size of 2 megawords (16 megabytes) and a seek time of 150
milliseconds (p. 20 of Buchholz), and it needed about 2.5 microseconds
per instruction (p. 32 of Buchholz), some of which could be
multiplies; its memory cycle time was 2.1 microseconds per 64-bit word
(p. 17 of Buchholz), giving 32 megabits per second, with a maximum of
2¹⁸ words (1 mebibyte).  Moreover, Stretch was shared by all of Los
Alamos National Labs, which I think was several hundred people at the
time, though perhaps only a few dozen of them had access to the
computer.</p>
<p>(On pp. 66–67 Engelbart describes the capabilities of a typical
computer of his day: 100,000 6-bit bytes of RAM costing 60¢–US$1.50
per byte, 2–10μs per machine instruction, with a megabyte-sized
magnetic drum costing 5¢ per byte, or a hundred-megabyte-sized disk
costing 0.14¢ per byte.)</p>
<p>So, roughly speaking, my laptop is 2.5 million times faster than
Stretch at multiplying (and arithmetic in general), 1000 times faster
than Stretch at accessing its RAM, of which it has 4096 times as much,
and 75 times faster than Stretch at accessing bulk storage, of which
it has 6000 times as much; and this computing power is distributed
among about 1000 times fewer people.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this extreme arithmetic power, it can do things
like real-time raytracing, software-defined radio, and speech
recognition.  Mostly, however, this arithmetic is devoted to
decompressing porn and other video.  I don’t have any
speech-recognition software on here.</p>
<p>I <em>can</em> and occasionally do use it for tasks like 3-D design, and
designing and testing signal-processing algorithms in IPython, and I
have a library of many technical papers, including the Engelbart
report I’m currently reading.  Due largely to format
incompatibilities, I don’t have an easy way to search through the
library for key words, although searching through an individual book
takes only a few seconds.  Quoting one document in another, as I did
above, often requires manual retyping — evince’s user interface
sometimes doesn’t respond to mouse drags, and it doesn’t offer an
interface to easily display an excerpt from a PDF or DjVu file, even
though those file formats contain internal indices to permit random
access.</p>
<p>I can easily prepare a document plotting a bunch of equations and
simulations, complete with nicely-typeset equations, using IPython;
TeX and HTML provide me with document-preparation capabilities
Engelbart’s whole team couldn’t pull together in 1962, even leaving
aside the ability to distribute the results immediately to the world.</p>
<p>I wrote a Tetris game a couple of days ago.  It took me three or four
hours, using the C programming language from the 1970s, slightly
augmented with type-checking from the 1980s.  Using a more modern
programming language would have simplified it only slightly.  It
doesn’t handle key-repeat in the way I would like, which is
substantially more difficult due to decisions baked into the X11
protocol in the 1980s to make terminal emulators easier to write;
fixing that will probably take several more hours.</p>
<p>When checking one of the assertions in Engelbart’s report, I quickly
calculated how many words you’d need in a lexicon for it to cover half
of the words in a sample corpus (95, for the British National Corpus).
This took me 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, Stack Exchange, arXiv, the Internet Archive, and other
sites with books and academic papers are perhaps the things that most
closely approximate Engelbart’s vision of jet-like “gains in personal
intellectual effectiveness”, since there I can easily get information
about a wide range of topics.  Unfortunately, though, they can only
provide answers to questions that someone else has already learned the
answers to; they are immensely useful for describing known
consequences, but they are not useful for working out the consequences
of situations I just dreamed up.</p>
<p>Consequently, I do most of my noodling in the same way I would have 56
years ago, with typed notes and a pencil and paper, but with quicker
access to the library of knowledge represented by Wikipedia and the
like, and the easier revision Engelbart suggests on p. 13 (though
Emacs is considerably more fluid than the OCR stylus he suggests, more
like the text editing process he suggests on p. 16, pp. 77–80, and p. 84).
I have instant access
to the worldwide community of knowledge workers, but this is useless;
they largely waste their time on trivialities
and infighting.</p>
<p>Nothing approaching Engelbart’s vision of the augmented architect has
been realized, despite the extensive computerization of architectural
drafting (p. 5):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He checks to make sure that sun glare from the windows will not
blind a driver on the roadway, and the "clerk" computes the
information that one window will reflect strongly onto the roadway
between 6 and 6:30 on midsummer mornings. … Finally he has the
"clerk" combine all of these sequences of activity to indicate spots
where traffic is heavy in the building, or where congestion might
occur, and to determine what the severest drain on the utilities is
likely to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I conclude that, so far, Engelbart’s unfinished revolution is still
unfinished.</p>
<h2>The failure of diffusion</h2>
<p>Remarks on pp. 16–17 express Engelbart’s forlorn hope that a
centrally-planned research effort could “greatly accelerate” the
evolutionary process of diffusion of innovations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Normally the necessary equipment would enter the market slowly;
changes from the expected would be small, people would change their
ways of doing things a little at a time, and only gradually would
their accumulated changes create markets for more radical versions
of the equipment.  Such an evolutionary process has been typical of
the way our repertoire hierarchies have grown and formed.</p>
<p>But an active research effort, aimed at exploring and evaluating
possible integrated changes throughout the repertoire hierarchy,
could greatly accelerate this evolutionary process.  The research
effort could guide the product development of new artifacts toward
taking long-range meaningful steps; simultaneously, competitively-
minded individuals who would respond to demonstrated methods for
achieving greater personal effectiveness would create a market for
the more radical equipment innovations.  The guided evolutionary
process could be expected to be considerably more rapid than the
traditional one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps if he had studied the accumulating literature on, for example,
diffusion of agricultural innovations in poor countries, he might have
had a better plan.  In retrospect, it took 20 years for even the
beginnings of his innovations to be adopted even by office workers,
and 40 years to be broadly adopted by society.</p>
<h2>How did Engelbart conceive training would happen?</h2>
<p>Engelbart put a lot of emphasis on the importance of “training”, which
is an important part of the process of diffusion of innovations, but
he seems to have lacked an anthropological or ethnographic conception
of how this training would come about; or at least he is silent on the
topic.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that Engelbart takes as his starting point “a man”,
that is to say, an individual, rather than an institution, grappling
with problems.  (The unexamined sexism in the terminology was <em>de
rigueur</em> in formal contexts in the US in 1962.)  To my mind, much of
the underlying zeitgeist of the work is collectivist, in the sense
that Engelbart imagines institutions supporting the individual
(“pursuit by an enlightened society”); he speaks of “diplomats,
executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists,
attorneys, designers,” perhaps with the implicit presumption that the
users of his system will be supported not only with a powerful
computer system but also with secretaries, administrative staff, a
purchasing department, and so on.  His “H-LAM/T” framework (p. 9)
cites the necessity of “training”, but never discusses the social
context of the training — is it provided to new employees by a
company, individually undertaken by problem-solvers who want to get
augmented, or required of the whole population by a government?</p>
<p>In the 1980s, when some of Engelbart’s ideas finally gained broad
adoption, training was precisely the point on which he remained
outside the mainstream, and which made his continuing research
progressively less relevant to that mainstream; CHI or HCI (already
purged of the implicit sexism of the term “man-machine interface”
term, or “man-artifact interface” as on p. 20) began to take advantage
of findings from cognitive science with an eye to market
competitiveness, while Engelbart did not.</p>
<p>On training, pp. 9–10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hile an untrained aborigine cannot drive a car through traffic,
because he cannot leap the gap between his cultural background and
the kind of world that contains cars and traffic, it is possible to
move step by step through an organized training program that will
enable him to drive effectively and safely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, part of this is that the first part of the report is purely
descriptive; it is not prescribing courses of action so much as it is
describing the human world as Engelbart sees it.  On p. 30 he talks a
bit more about the circumstances of training in the context of
possible research programs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For instance, some research situations might have to disallow
changes which require extensive retraining, or which require
undignified behavior by the human.  Other situations might admit
changes requiring years of training, very expensive equipment, or
the use of special drugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(In this context it is worth pointing out that the Tuskegee Experiment
was still ongoing at the time, no such thing as an IRB existed, LSD
was still legal, and the MKUltra research program was in full swing,
although it wouldn’t be revealed to the public until 1975.)</p>
<p>This is unfortunate in part because the advent of computer games
showed that computers were capable of producing fairly extreme
learning performance by setting up a sort of Skinner box.  But
Engelbart was writing too early, and on the wrong coast, to have
observed Spacewar!, and in any case computer games didn’t really have
a significant number of players until the 1970s.  Consequently his
focus, in practical terms, was mostly on designing new artifacts (in
his H-LAM/T breakdown) to perform work for humans, then training
humans to use them, rather than on designing new forms of training.</p>
<h2>The lack of emphasis on communication</h2>
<p>As I said above, Engelbart’s focus is primarily individualist,
focusing on the individual in their efforts to solve problems, but
implicitly collectivist; he treats communication and community as
secondary to individual thought and action, e.g., p. 22:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans made another great step forward when they learned to
represent particular concepts in their minds with specific symbols.
Here we temporarily disregard communicative speech and writing, and
consider only the direct value to the <em>individual</em> of being able to
do his [sic] heavy thinking by mentally manipulating symbols instead
of the more unwieldly [sic] concepts which they represent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a sense, this is the same lacuna represented by the mysterious
absence of discussion of the social context of training.</p>
<p>He says, “temporarily,” but so far I have not encountered where he
analyzes communication in such a way.</p>
<p>On pp. 90–91, he does mention the utility of rich hypertext structures
with typed links for communication, and even talks a bit about
pedagogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, when you ever get handy at roaming over the type of symbol
structure which we have been showing here, and you turn for this
purpose to another person's work that is structured in this way, you
will find a terrific difference there in the ease of gaining
comprehension as to what he has done and why he has done it, and of
isolating what you want to use and making sure of the conditions
under which you can use it.  This is true even if you find his
structure left in the condition in which he has been working on
it--that is, with no special provisions for helping an outsider find
his way around.  But we have learned quite a few simple tricks… Some
of these techniques are quite closely related to those used in
automated-instruction programming--perhaps you know about 'teaching
machines?'</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The power of the unpredictable and of irrationality</h2>
<p>Engelbart touts of unpredictable processes, claiming that the power to
use them is one of the largest benefits of the computerized
augmentation he proposes (p. 45):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the course of action must respond to new comprehension, new
insights and new intuitive flashes of possible explanations or
solutions, it will not be an orderly process.  Existing means of
composing and working with symbol structures penalize disorderly
processes very heavily, and it is part of the real promise in the
automated H-LAM/T systems of tomorrow that the human can have the
freedom and power of disorderly processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simultaneously, though, he perceives the subconscious mind as mostly
an enemy due to its irrationality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clinical psychology seems to provide clear evidence that a large
proportion of a human's everyday activity is significantly mediated
or basically prompted by unconscious mental processes that, although
"natural" in a functional sense, are not rational. … It may be that
the first stages of research on augmenting the human intellect will
have to proceed without being able to do anything about <strong>this
problem</strong> [emphasis mine] except accommodate it as well as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>On reasoning and argument structures</h2>
<p>On p. 62 Engelbart is discussing the process of revising a research
design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…when several consideration statements bore upon a given product
statement, and when that product statement came to be modified
through some other consideration, it was not always easy to remember
why it had been established as it had.  Being able to fish out the
other considerations linked to that statement would have helped
considerably.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern automated software testing supplies this in a somewhat
restricted form: if you change the code and some tests start failing,
you can go back and read those tests to find out what other
considerations led to the code behaving as it had; but of course not
everything can be described in code yet.  Proof assistants perform a
similar task in a more rigorous fashion for mathematical proofs.
Requirements-management systems like DOORS also attempt to do this for
more general structures of non-machine-readable statements.</p>
<p>He goes into more detail about his proposed antecedent-consequent
links on pp. 84–88.</p>
<h2>Chording keysets and premature commitment</h2>
<p>On pp. 74–79, Engelbart describes the chording keysets that his system
used into the 1980s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He could hit a great many combinations of keys on his keyset--i.e.,
any one stroke of his hand could depress a number of keys, which
gave him over a thousand unique single-stroke signals to the
computer with either hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was quite optimistic about the speed of this system, with a quite
reasonable information-theoretic basis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that, for instance, the 150 most commonly used words in a
natural language made up about half of any normal text in that
language.  Joe said that it was quite feasible to learn and use the
single-stroke abbreviations for about half of the words he used, but
beyond that each added percent began to require him to have too many
abbreviations under his command. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(As it turns out, the 95 most commonly used words, without
lemmatization or even stemming, make up half of the text in the
British National Corpus; the 150 most common words make up
54.43% — though this disregards the tail of words that occurred less
than 5 times, which might indeed amount to the 9% of the total that
would make his statement correct.  Thanks to augmentation, I could
calculate this in about four minutes by writing an 8-line Python
script.  Doing the same exercise on words extracted from an earlier
draft of this note, I needed 179 words, drawn from the 223 most common
words in the BNC, to reach 50% of the words in this note; some common
words, such as “she”, “her”, and “know”, did not appear.  6.3% of the
total words in this note, such as “1968”, “lemmmatization”, and
“keysets”, don’t appear in the BNC at all.  Incidentally, the point in
the curve at which a given word makes up 0.1% of the corpus — so it
could conceivably be efficient to enter it with a 10-bit abbreviation
code — is just about that 50th percentile (95 words) in the BNC; this
note is too short to give good statistics at that level.  This greater
rigor brought the total to almost 40 minutes rather than 4.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A whole word so abbreviated saved typing all the letters as well as
the spaces at either side of the word, and a word-ending abbreviated
by a single stroke saved typing the letters and the end-of-word
space.  He claimed that he could comfortably rattle off about 180
words a minute--faster than he could reasonably talk. … He made some
brief references to statistical predictions that the computer could
make regarding what you were going to type next, and that if you got
reasonably skillful you could "steer through the extrapolated
prediction field" as you entered your information…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, though, the chording keysets constructed by his team
didn’t really reach above about 50 words per minute, according to
anecdotes.  Part of this may have been that they ended up using only
one key per finger (the “over a thousand” quoted above suggests two
bits per finger, e.g., four keys per finger or two keys per finger
that can be concurrently depressed) but other parts may have been the
lack of the extensive abbreviation dictionary described.</p>
<p>This leads one to ask: why didn’t Engelbart give up on his own keyset
design at some point and use a Stenotype keyboard?  Stenotype
operators regularly reach well over the 180 words per minute he was
hoping for.  Instead, he apparently continued to hope that the design
he came up with in 1962, before doing any experiments, would
eventually pan out.  That was a terrible idea; it prevented him from
taking advantage of the 20+ years of experience he gained in the
meantime.</p>
<p>Similarly, the outliner structure of NLS and Augment already appears
on p. 84.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
