garbage collection, an interesting new way to do ad-hoc polymorphism,
parametrically polymorphic finite maps, a range type, lightweight and
relatively safe concurrency constructs, complex numbers, type-safe
variadic parameters, run-time type identification, exception handling
with FIFO automatic cleanup, a string type with equality and
concatenation, and a print statement.  However, without importing at
least some packages, there’s no way for a Go program to obtain input,
and there are a lot of facilities that are easily accessible in the
standard library that can save you a lot of time.</p>
<p>I’m just starting to learn Golang, so I’m taking some notes on the
standard library from <a href="http://localhost:6060/pkg/">http://localhost:6060/pkg/</a>, which is
unfortunately organized alphabetically, which means that really
recondite stuff is mixed in with really basic stuff.  So this is my
attempt to summarize what I think is most important.</p>
<p>The standard Golang library seems to be entirely lacking facilities
for interactive terminal I/O and GUIs.</p>
<h1>Really basic packages</h1><div class="metadata">Kragen Javier Sitaker, 2019-02-08
(20 minutes)</div>
<p>These are all you need for a pretty wide range of stuff: <code>testing</code>,
<code>io</code>, <code>fmt</code>, <code>os</code>, <code>strconv</code>, <code>bytes</code>, <code>strings</code>, <code>math</code>, and <code>sort</code>.
Without any one of these, you’d be pretty handicapped.</p>
<h2><code>testing</code></h2>
<p><code>go test</code> runs automated test suites written using functions named
<code>TestFoo</code>, that take pointers to <code>testing.T</code> objects, in <code>foo_test.go</code>
files.  It also has benchmarking and doctest-like functionality.  I
have to admit I haven’t tried this yet because so far I haven’t
written any Golang packages, just standalone programs, and I’m not
sure how to use it with those.</p>
<p>The <code>test/quick</code> subpackage does generative property-based testing,
like Hypothesis.</p>
<h2><code>fmt</code></h2>
<p><code>fmt</code> does formatted I/O, including <code>Printf</code>.  It can use reflection
to dump out structs (<code>%v</code>, applicable to any type, or <code>%+v</code> to see
field names) and even Golang-syntax representations (<code>%#v</code>).
Naturally there’s a <code>fmt.Formatter</code> interface you can implement to
override the default formatting.</p>
<p>Because of reflection, <code>fmt.Fscan</code>, <code>fmt.Scan</code>, <code>fmt.Sscan</code>, etc.,
don’t need a format string at all — you just give them some interface
values pointing at where you want to store the results — and the same
is true of <code>fmt.Print</code>.  Scanning can be overridden with a custom
<code>Scan</code> method.</p>
<p>There’s also a <code>print</code> function you can use without importing <code>fmt</code>.</p>
<h2><code>io</code></h2>
<p><code>io</code> is where you find the Reader and Writer protocols, among others;
<code>fmt.Fprintf</code> takes an <code>io.Writer</code> rather than a file.  It also
contains things like <code>io.Copy</code>, which normally copies a <code>Reader</code> to a
<code>Writer</code>, but when possible uses more efficient methods, which I
assume means <code>sendfile(2)</code>; plumbing utilities like <code>io.LimitReader</code>,
<code>io.LimitWriter</code>, <code>io.Pipe</code>, <code>io.MultiReader</code> (cat), <code>io.MultiWriter</code>
(tee), and <code>io.TeeReader</code> (tee); <code>io.ReaderAt</code>, suitable for
concurrent random-access record I/O from multiple goroutines; etc.</p>
<p>An interesting difference from Unix (or Python) is that <code>Read()</code> is
supposed to return the error <code>io.EOF</code> at EOF rather than just an empty
byte count.  This has the annoying result that if you <code>import "os"</code>
and do file I/O with it, you probably also need to <code>import "io"</code>.</p>
<p>The subpackage <code>io/ioutil</code> contains <code>ReadFile</code>, <code>WriteFile</code>, and
tempfiles.</p>
<h2><code>os</code></h2>
<p><code>os</code> is where you find <code>Args</code> and most of the Unix API, including
things like <code>Open(filename)</code>, <code>Getpid()</code>, and <code>os.Stdout</code>, which is an
unbuffered <code>io.Writer</code>, which you can buffer using <code>bufio</code>.  Opening a
file for writing requires calling either <code>os.Create</code> or <code>os.OpenFile</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a separate <code>File.WriteString</code> method for when you have a
<code>string</code> rather than a <code>[]byte</code> to write to a file.  This is sort of
strange because you can convert from <code>string</code> to <code>[]byte</code> with
<code>[]byte(s)</code>, which makes me think this method may be left over from an
earlier version of Golang where you couldn’t do that.</p>
<p>The design is a mix of very Unixy and somewhat portable.  File
permissions are a 32-bit int with no place to put, for example, a
separate “delete” permission bit, as on VMS.  But the inode returned
by <code>os.Stat</code> (<code>FileInfo</code>) isn’t even a concrete type at all, but an
interface.  (And it includes the file’s basename, but not e.g. ctime,
so it’s only sort of an inode.)</p>
<p>The <code>os.Process</code> API is an interesting design, clearly designed with
non-Unix systems in mind.  (There’s no <code>os.Fork</code>!)  It’s somewhat
weak; there’s no nonblocking <code>waitpid</code>, for example, and thus no way
to get an <code>os.ProcessState</code> for a running process!  <code>os.exec</code> has a
more convenient interface, but it’s apparently built on <code>os.Process</code>
and therefore can’t do anything <code>os.Process</code> can’t.</p>
<p>There also doesn’t seem to be a way to call select(2), although of
course you can spawn off a goroutine or two per fire descriptor.</p>
<h2><code>strconv</code></h2>
<p><code>strconv</code> is where you look for conversion to and from strings,
although <code>fmt.Sprintf</code> gives you a more capable way to build strings.</p>
<h2><code>bytes</code></h2>
<p>Things you would expect to be utility methods on strings (<code>ToUpper</code>¸
<code>Join</code>, <code>Split</code>, <code>TrimRight</code>, <code>Compare</code>, <code>HasPrefix</code>) are here, as are
<code>io.Reader</code> and <code>io.Writer</code> interfaces for in-memory “files”.  There’s
a corresponding <code>strings</code> module for strings.</p>
<p>There are actually two different <code>io.Reader</code> implementations: the
read-write <code>bytes.Buffer</code> and the seekable <code>bytes.Reader</code>.
<code>bytes.Buffer</code>, in addition to converting output-generation functions
into string-building functions, also allows you to buffer your output
in a more controllable way than the <code>bufio</code> module mentioned
below — it guarantees to return no errors when you write to it (it
will <code>panic</code> instead if it runs out of memory) and allows you to
accumulate the bytes written until you're ready to do something more
interesting with them, like send them over a socket.</p>
<h2><code>strings</code></h2>
<p>This is almost the same as the <code>bytes</code> package, but for strings, even
to the point of including the unnecessary <code>Compare</code> function.
Naturally, though, it omits the read-write <code>Buffer</code> interface.</p>
<h2><code>math</code></h2>
<p>This has the usual set of floating-point functions; you know, <code>Acosh</code>,
<code>Cos</code>, <code>Ceil</code>, <code>IsNaN</code>, <code>Max</code>, Bessel functions, <code>Erfc</code>, and so on.
Angles are in radians, logarithms are natural where not otherwise
specified.  There are functions to convert floats to and from raw
bits.</p>
<h2><code>sort</code></h2>
<p><code>sort</code> provides an exchange sort, with stable and unstable variants,
and it’s somewhat less comfortable than its Python equivalent not only
because you have to import it explicitly, but because it requires that
the sequence you’re sorting implement <code>sort.Interface</code>, which is
impossible for raw slices.  (The <em>sequence</em> implements the interface,
not the data items being sorted.)</p>
<p>This module contains heapsort, insertion sort, binary quicksort with
some optimized pivot selection, and mergesort; the quicksort fails
over to heapsort if it goes badly, an approach sometimes known as
“introsort”.</p>
<p>The mergesort is apparently a 21st-century optimization of binary
mergesort which uses only logarithmic space rather than the usual
linear space, at the cost of some extra swaps.</p>
<p>The package also implements binary search as <code>sort.Search</code>,
generalized to the case of a general function over integers 0..n
(i.e. not just for searching sorted sequences in memory).</p>
<p>For convenience, there are a number of wrappers for sorting and
searching built-in data types.</p>
<h1>Somewhat less basic packages</h1>
<p>These are very common things but not quite as absolutely basic as the
ones listed above.  These are <code>flag</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>bufio</code>, <code>math/rand</code>,
<code>time</code>, <code>net/http</code>, <code>net/url</code>, <code>net/mail</code>, <code>mime</code>, <code>regexp</code>,
<code>encoding/gob</code>, <code>encoding/json</code>, <code>encoding/binary</code>, <code>image</code>, <code>C</code>, and
<code>yacc</code>.</p>
<h2><code>flag</code></h2>
<p>This is the standard way to implement command-line parsing.  For
better or worse, it doesn’t support combinable Unix-style
single-letter flags, just long-only options, and it doesn’t support
GNU-style options following non-option arguments.</p>
<h2><code>log</code></h2>
<p><code>log</code> is the standard way to log errors and other messages.  This is
how you debug your programs, and <code>log.Fatal</code> or <code>log.Fatalf</code> is how
you report fatal errors and exit.  There’s no tagging, logging levels,
complex object serialization, or filtering, but you can set a prefix
and twiddle a couple of formatting flags.  You can create different
<code>log.Logger</code> objects with <code>log.New</code>, sending information to the same
or different files, and pass them around as you like.</p>
<p>I wanted to put this in the “Really basic packages” category, since I
import it in every Golang program I write, but the truth is that you
can get by without it a lot more easily than you can get by without
<code>math</code>, <code>sort</code>, or <code>strconv</code>.</p>
<h2><code>bufio</code></h2>
<p>This adds I/O buffering to an <code>io.Writer</code> (for performance) or an
<code>io.Reader</code> (so you can put back already-read bytes or runes, for
parsing reasons, as <code>fmt.Fscan</code> does).  It also contains
<code>bufio.Scanner</code>, which parses things like (limited) CSV.  (There’s
also a CSV parser in <code>encoding/csv</code>.)</p>
<h2><code>math/rand</code></h2>
<p>This is a random number generator, which includes a shuffler in the
form of <code>rand.Perm</code>.</p>
<h2><code>time</code></h2>
<p>This package mixes together access to the real-time clock
(<code>time.Now()</code>), calendrical calculations, formatting, time zones, and
scheduling.  The time format used internally is nanosecond-precision
and has its zero value at the beginning of year 1 CE in UTC.</p>
<p>This package includes a syntax for durations, which are int64
nanosecond counts; the syntax accepts “300μs”. ♥</p>
<p>Because Go has no operator overloading, the Time type has .Add and
.Sub methods to interact with Duration.</p>
<h2><code>net/http</code></h2>
<p>This includes a fairly easy HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 client and server with
TLS support.  An HTTP server fits in a Tweet:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import . "net/http"

func main() {
        HandleFunc("/", func(w ResponseWriter, r *Request) { w.Write([]byte("hello")) })
        ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This also provides a convenient interface to the query-string parsing
in <code>net/url</code>; the <code>http.Request</code> object above has a <code>FormValue</code>
method.</p>
<h2><code>net/url</code></h2>
<p><code>net/url</code> does URL parsing, construction, escaping, unescaping,
relative URL resolution, and query-string encoding and decoding.</p>
<pre><code>u, err := url.Parse("http://bing.com/search?q=dotnet")
</code></pre>
<h2><code>net/mail</code></h2>
<p><code>net/mail</code> parses RFC-822 (well, RFC-5322) mail messages and
addresses, but not MIME, and it doesn’t format mail messages, just
parses them.</p>
<h2><code>mime</code></h2>
<p><code>mime</code> implements “parts of the MIME spec”, including reading
/etc/mime.types and the b-encoding and q-encoding used in mail
headers.  Subpackages implement quoted-printable and multipart
encoding, but I don’t think there’s anything here that will give you a
decoded email message body directly; this package is more aimed at
handling mail headers and HTTP messages.</p>
<h2><code>regexp</code></h2>
<p>This implements a fairly Perl-compatible regexp engine, including
non-greediness and the Python extension of named <code>(?P&lt;foo&gt;bar)</code>
capture groups, but with no backreferences.  Given the history of Russ
Cox and Ken Thompson in writing high-performance regular expression
libraries, using DFAs that can’t handle backreferences, you would
think that this library would be super fast, but usually it seems to
be noticeably slower than Python’s and Perl’s.  It does, however,
avoid the exponential behavior characteristic of NFA engines in cases
like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Pathological regexp.
// The Python equivalent takes exponentially long:
// __import__('re').compile('(x|xx)*y').match('xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')
package main

import "regexp"

func main() {
        regexp.MustCompile("(x|xx)*y").FindString("xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")
}
</code></pre>
<h2><code>encoding/gob</code></h2>
<p>This is a generic serialization/deserialization system, using a
Go-specific serialization, and it seems to be the closest equivalent
to Python’s <code>pickle</code>, though it doesn’t support circular references.
It supports maps, structs, arrays, slices, bools, signed and unsigned
integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers, and strings;
structs include only exported fields, and functions and channels are
omitted.  Interface types are supported with a little more hassle.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to register user-defined types before sending them
or for them to implement any particular interface, although there is
an interface that they <em>can</em> define to override the default
marshaling.  There is some limited support for schema evolution even
in the default marshaling.</p>
<h2><code>encoding/json</code></h2>
<p><code>json.Marshal</code> converts a Golang value into JSON; it supports bool,
numbers, strings, arrays, slices, maps from string, and structs
(except for unexported fields or fields tagged with “-”.)  This is
actually the only use I’ve seen so far of struct field tags.</p>
<p>Naturally, of course you can override the JSON serialization by
implementing an interface.</p>
<p><code>json.Unmarshal</code> takes an optionally-nil destination argument, which I
suppose allows it to determine what types to deserialize things as.</p>
<p>This module <em>does</em> support reading a sequence of JSON values from the
same input stream; perhaps more interestingly, it has some minimal
support for sequentially reading JSON items inside an outer JSON
wrapper.</p>
<h2><code>encoding/binary</code></h2>
<p><code>encoding/binary</code> contains functions <code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code> which can be
used to parse and generate binary data in an externally-imposed
format.  They’re slow because they use reflection (“Python-class
slow,” as Tommi Virtanen explained to me).  This provides an easy way
to do what the Perl <code>pack</code> and <code>unpack</code> functions do, or <code>struct.pack</code>
and <code>struct.unpack</code> from Python.</p>
<h2><code>image</code></h2>
<p>This module and its submodules provide support for encoding and
decoding PNG, GIF (including animation), and JPEG files.  You
generally will load the images by calling <code>image.Decode</code> without
explicitly mentioning the specific image format module, except to
import it, but to save e.g. a PNG you need to call <code>png.Encode</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>image.Image</code> interface looks impossibly inefficient, requiring an
indirect function call and some coordinate arithmetic for every pixel.</p>
<p>It looks like the PNG loading is eager and ahead-of-time, storing the
image in RAM, although <code>image.Image</code> doesn’t strictly require that.</p>
<p>The <code>image</code> module also contains some basic 2-D graphics stuff, like
<code>image.Rectangle</code> (bounding boxes) and <code>image.Point</code>.</p>
<h2><code>C</code></h2>
<p><a href="http://localhost:6060/cmd/cgo/">cgo</a> isn’t actually a Golang package;
it’s a way to invoke statically-linked C libraries.  But you import it
as a package named "C", and you add some special comments before that
import in order to link in the stuff you want.</p>
<p>...and then the Go compiler searches your directory for files named
<code>*.c</code>, <code>*.s</code>, <code>*.S</code>, <code>*.cc</code>, <code>*.cpp</code>, or <code>*.cxx</code> (but not <code>*.C</code>) to
compile with the C, C++, or assembly compiler.  Except that I’m not
clear which compiler it uses for this: GCC or the Plan9 C compiler?</p>
<p>Presumably if you want to load and invoke shared libraries written in
C, this is the way to do it.</p>
<h2><code>yacc</code></h2>
<p>If you want to parse something more than regular languages, <code>go tool
yacc</code> is probably the thing to use.  It’s mostly undocumented, but
it’s similar enough to Bison, ocamlyacc, etc., that it should be
reasonably attainable.</p>
<h1>Somewhat more recondite packages</h1>
<p>I’ve also taken some notes on some other packages that seem less
central to me.</p>
<h2><code>html/template</code></h2>
<p><code>html/template</code> gives you convenient XSS-safe HTML templating.  Its
capabilities are fairly elaborate, and there's also a <code>text/template</code>
package for doing the same kind of thing without the HTML escaping.</p>
<h2><code>syscall</code></h2>
<p>This deprecated package provides access to basically the entire Linux
(or other) native system call interface, including weird things like
epoll(7), <code>ETH_P_IRDA</code>, inotify(7), <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code>, and openat(2).  The
<code>unsafe</code> package has some details on directly invoking Linux system
calls.</p>
<p>This is also the package where you get errno values, if you want to
test those against the <code>Err</code> attribute of e.g. an <code>os.PathError</code>.</p>
<h2><code>encoding/xml</code></h2>
<p><code>encoding/xml</code> contains an XML parser and emitter, some HTML parsing,
and something that looks suspiciously like another generic
serialization system like Gob and the one in <code>encoding/json</code>, but
really isn’t.</p>
<p>The serialization system handles arrays, slices, structs, and
interfaces, but not maps, and like the JSON serializer, it optionally
uses struct field tags.  It seems to be designed to allow you to
produce arbitrary XML by marshalling structs, and parse almost
arbitrary XML by unmarshalling.</p>
<p>This module doesn’t provide DOM or SAX interfaces, but it has
interfaces that are sort of similar.</p>
<h2><code>net</code></h2>
<p>This library provides sockets, basically, but with a somewhat nicer
interface.  Like, actually a dramatically nicer interface.  TCP
sockets have SetNoDelay and SetLinger methods, for example, and you
can invoke <code>net.Dial("tcp", "google.com:http")</code> to open a connection.</p>
<h2><code>index/suffixarray</code></h2>
<p><code>suffixarray</code> provides an in-RAM search index that supports regular
expression searches, though using a log-linear-time construction
algorithm rather than a linear-time one.  On my laptop, it takes about
1.8 seconds to index a megabyte, about 26 seconds to index 10
megabytes, and 540 seconds to index 100 megabytes; then, each match
for a simple regexp in the 10MB index takes 1.3 ms, and each match in
the 100MB index takes 2.5 ms.  It uses 1.6 GB of RAM to index 100
megabytes, which is maybe a bit excessive.</p>
<p>You can write the index to a file, which is about 4.8 bytes for each
byte that you originally indexed.  My laptop can then read the index
in at about 100 megabytes a second, which is a necessary prerequisite
to doing searches with it.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, I tried <code>index/suffixarray</code>, the raw regexp
engine, and the Python regexp engine to find the '^From ' lines
delimiting messages in a 100MB mbox.  The indexed search found the
3593 <code>From_</code> lines in 17.5 seconds.  Just reading the file in and
running the regexp engine over it found them in 12.6 seconds.  The
Python version took 2.0 seconds.</p>
<p>This seemed like unreasonably poor performance, so I tried searching
for a spammer’s email address.  The Python version found the three
matches in 430 ms; the Golang brute-force version found them in 210
ms; and the indexed version found them in 4.3 seconds, of which 4.0
seconds were spent reading the index.</p>
<p>Just for kicks, I tried a Perl version.  It produced the 3593 <code>From_</code>
lines in 220 ms and the three hits for the spammer’s address in
195 ms, but upon trying to find all the lines <em>containing</em> the address
(regexp <code>^.*VanceE.McCray.*</code>), I killed it after 21 minutes.  Python
managed to finish that job in 2.7 seconds, the Golang brute force
version in 36 seconds, and the Golang indexed version in 45 seconds.</p>
<p>So I haven’t been able to find any cases where <code>index/suffixarray</code> is
faster than doing a brute-force regexp search on the file data in RAM,
even though it uses several times as much RAM.</p>
<h2><code>runtime</code></h2>
<p><code>runtime</code> provides control over the garbage collector (including
setting finalizers), a <code>Caller</code> function to walk the stack, and a
bunch of profiling stuff I don’t know how to use yet.  (I guess I
could call the <code>runtime.debug.PrintStack</code> function periodically and
save the results, and that would be a crude profiler.)</p>
<h2><code>net/rpc</code></h2>
<p><code>net/rpc</code> is an RPC system using the <code>encoding/gob</code> serialization; a
JSON-serialized variant is in <code>net/rpc/jsonrpc</code>.  It doesn’t enjoy a
lot of syntactic sugar.</p>
<h2><code>zip</code></h2>
<p><code>zip</code> lets you read and write zipfiles, but only items compressed with
the “store” and “deflate” methods.  It uses the same <code>io.Reader</code> and
<code>io.Writer</code> interfaces everything else does (or rather <code>io.ReadCloser</code>
and <code>io.Writer</code>.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
