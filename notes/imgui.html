(3 minutes)</div><p>So, um, immediate-mode GUIs are pretty cool.  They allow you to avoid
using data memory for objects on the display, which not only reduces
your memory usage, but also prevents desynchronization and avoids heap
allocation.</p>
<p>One problem with IMGUIs is that they generally need an ID for each
widget, which you can generate somewhat clumsily using <code>__LINE__</code> in C,
<a href="http://sol.gfxile.net/imgui/ch04.html">as explained by Jari Komppa</a>.
This clutters up your code a bit.  <a href="https://github.com/AdrienHerubel/imgui">Adrien Herubel's IMGUI
library</a> avoids this problem
by maintaining a hidden <code>widgetId</code>; in imgui.cpp, for example:</p>
<pre><code>bool imguiCheck(const char* text, bool checked, bool enabled)
{
        g_state.widgetId++;
        unsigned int id = (g_state.areaId&lt;&lt;16) | g_state.widgetId;
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>This means that instead of writing code like this:</p>
<pre><code> toggle = imguiCheck(GEN_ID, "Checkbox", checked1);
</code></pre>
<p>you can write code like this:</p>
<pre><code> toggle = imguiCheck("Checkbox", checked1);
</code></pre>
<p>But it has the problem that if you insert more widgets inside the same
scroll area, for example because you have a variable-length
subsequence of widgets, then your IDs will shift, and your widgets
will get confused about which of them is active or hot.</p>
<p>It's possible to avoid this problem by using a sort of DOM-tree-ish
approach and expanding each widget identifier from a single ID number
out to an entire path from the root of a widget hierarchy — perhaps
you limit each level of the hierarchy to 256 elements, and then you
can identify a widget up to 6 levels deep with 6 bytes.</p>
<p>(Additionally if client code can increment the current widget ID up to
some number after passing through a region of variable widget count,
that could help.)</p>
<p>The hierarchy need not correspond to any nesting of rectangles on the
screen.  It can be entirely conceptual; in the environment where I
came up with it, it was a menu tree, where only the innermost menu of
your navigation was ever displayed.  It enables you to tell not only
on which widget the current keyboard focus is, but also all of the
things it's nested within.</p>
<p>Many times, though, you'll have more possible widgets to display than
you want to display at a given moment.  In these cases it would be
nice to leap past all these widgets without, for speed, actually
having to execute the code for each one — and if the number is
arbitrary, executing the code for each one would take infinite time.
So this containment hierarchy can serve as a way to efficiently
disable different parts of the world.</p>
<p>Sigh.  I'm not sure if this approach really generalizes well...</p>
<p>I wonder what reactive programming has to offer here.  Meteor-style
reactivity has a similar feel to IMGUIs; is there a unity between the
approaches I'm not seeing?</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
