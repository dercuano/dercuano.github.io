(3 minutes)</div><p>There are apparently three different ways to program AVRs:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-voltage “parallel” programming with +12V on the /RESET pin
  (e.g. §21.2, p.184, of the ATtiny2313A datasheet), used by e.g. the
  STK500, which, despite the name, still uses only a single pin for
  the data bits in and out;</li>
<li>“Serial” programming with the SPI bus while /RESET is low
  (e.g. §21.3, p.193, of the ATtiny2313A datasheet), which is what is
  explained in <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/learn/avr/programming.html">Limor Fried’s tutorials</a>, which I think requires
  the /RESET pin to exist, i.e. not be reconfigured as PA2, debugWIRE,
  or PCINT10 — the RSTDISBL pin of the fuse bits determines this, and
  additionally there’s a SPIEN pin;</li>
<li>with the “store program memory” instruction, e.g. from the Arduino
  bootloader, as explained in e.g. §19, p.173, of the ATtiny2313A
  datasheet, which can get its data from anywhere you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I should be able to bitbang the serial programming interface
from an Arduino or other AVR, but this will require talking some
protocol to avrdude.  This is I think the purpose of the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/mega-isp/">mega-isp
firmware</a> and <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP">ArduinoISP firmware</a> derived from it.</p>
<p>The ArduinoISP page shows using an external clock crystal and two
18–22 pF capacitors to get the device being programmed to be
sufficiently functional to accept programming, if it isn’t configured
to use its internal clock.  <a href="http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=125248.0">By default the divide-by-8 fuse is
set</a> so the chip’s clock rate is only 1MHz.  At least the
ATtiny2313 is documented to use the internal oscillator by default.</p>
<p>It seems like maybe even an ATTiny45 ought to be enough to use for
serial programming: it has 8 pins, of which 3 are used for Vcc,
ground, and /RESET; three more are used for SCK, MISO, and MOSI, which
can control the serial bus of another AVR being submitted to
programming; and two more are available for some other kind of
communication.  Or you could bitbang the SPI protocol for programming
and use the SCL and SDA pins to speak I²C to get programmed.</p>
<p>The ATtiny2313 SOIC unfortunately has the ground pin at the opposite
extreme of the chip from the Vcc, /RESET, SCK, MISO, and MOSI pins
that are needed for in-circuit programming, so you need a full 20-pin
SOIC clip to program it this way.  So I need 13mm of PCI bus to clip
the whole thing into, with the attendant possible problems with good
contact.</p>
<p>Arduinos have a standard six-pin ISP programming header, which I
hadn’t realized.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
