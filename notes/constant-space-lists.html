(10 minutes)</div><p>We can manipulate arrays of (equal-sized) objects in constant time
without the possibility of failure and without creating garbage.  It
would be desirable to also manipulate flexible, irregular data
structures in constant time without the possibility of failure and
without creating garbage.  These three desiderata are nearly in
increasing order or specificity — allocation implies the possibility
of allocation failure, and if you are occasionally creating garbage,
then eventually you will run out of memory if you don’t allocate any
more; and allocation almost always implies non-constant-time behavior,
except in extreme cases such as stack allocation and allocation from a
fixed pool.</p>
<h2>The Lisp memory model and failure</h2>
<p>The Lisp memory model, an arbitrary directed object graph with garbage
collection, is very flexible; it lets us treat arbitrarily large and
irregular objects as if they were register values, just by using their
memory addresses to name them, as long as we don’t mutate them.
That’s why most modern programming languages have adopted it: Python,
Java, Lua, JS, and many others.  (Others, like C++ and Golang, use a
hybrid scheme in which some objects are embedded in other objects.)</p>
<p>The fundamental object graph construction operation is to create a new
object from a tuple of (references to) existing objects; its simplest
form is Lisp’s <code>cons</code>.  As long as you stick to this operation,
reference counting is adequate, though slow, to manage memory;
generational garbage collection without a write or read barrier is
also adequate, and fast.  However, note that this operation can fail.
The price of using this memory model is that memory allocation is
ubiquitous, so nearly any computation can fail or take an arbitrarily
long time, so it is best used for programs where failure is an option.</p>
<p>Rather than constructing new objects, we could mutate existing
objects.  In this case, the fundamental operation is to overwrite a
field with a reference to some existing object.  Since this permits
creating references from older objects to newer ones, generational GC
becomes more complicated, and cyclic references make refcounting
dangerous.  The operation cannot fail, and it’s constant time if
you’re not using refcounting, but it can create garbage, and you
cannot tell whether it has created garbage or not without a global
reference graph computation.</p>
<h2>The Z-machine</h2>
<p>The Zork Z-machine memory model was designed for flexibly simulating
virtual worlds on tiny microcomputers where memory exhaustion was a
constant danger, and one which really harshes the buzz of dungeon
exploration if it comes to pass.  It runs in constant space and
constant time and does not create garbage, and although it is not as
flexible as the Lisp memory model, it is more flexible than most of
the alternatives.</p>
<p>All objects in the Z-machine are arranged into a single hierarchy by
way of three pointers per object: parent, first child, and next
sibling.  The fundamental hierarchy mutation operation is to change
the parent of an object, which cannot fail.  In Zork and similar
games, this was used to express physical containment.</p>
<p>(I lied somewhat here when I said that it runs in constant time and
does not create garbage; if you allow an object to become a descendant
of itself, it can create garbage, because then it becoes disconnected
from the rest of the hierarchy; and if you check to see if you are
doing this, that check will not run in constant time, and it may
fail.)</p>
<h2>Sketchpad’s ring structure</h2>
<p>In Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad, each type of object participated in
one or more “rings”, which were intrusive circular doubly-linked lists
in memory.  XXX add more info</p>
<h2>Zzstructure</h2>
<p>Ted Nelson’s “ZigZag” program relates objects along an arbitrary
number of “axes”, which can be traversed in either direction;
hierarchies are expressed with two axes, a “first-child” axis and a
“next-sibling” axis, which traversed in reverse are
“is-the-first-child-of” and “previous-sibling”.  To preserve his
“ZigZag” trademark, Nelson recommends calling this kind of structure
“Zzstructure”.  A straightforward implementation of it in memory just
uses doubly-linked lists, like Sketchpad but without the circularity,
or like the Z-machine generalized to many hierarchies, but without the
constant-time traversal to the parent.</p>
<p>The fundamental operation of zzstructure is, as I understand it, to
change the next or previous object of an object along an axis.  If
previously next-sibling(A) was B, then also previous-sibling(B) was A;
if we set next-sibling(A) ← C, then next-sibling(A) will be C, and
previous-sibling(C) will be A.  What happens to previous-sibling(B)?
I assume it must become nil, and similarly with next-sibling(D) where
D was the former value of previous-sibling(C), if any.</p>
<p>So this operation need not allocate, and it cannot fail, but it can
create garbage, because B and previous-sibling(C) may have become
unreachable.</p>
<h2>Pipeline and magtape processing</h2>
<p>A popular alternative in some environments is to use “streams” or lazy
lists rather than reifying the entire list in memory.  So, for
example, in Python you can compute a maximal nondecreasing subsequence
of a sequence in “constant space” as follows:</p>
<pre><code>def mnds(xs):
    xs = iter(xs)
    last = xs.next()
    yield last

    for x in xs:
        if x &gt;= last:
            last = x
            yield last
</code></pre>
<p>One or another kind of iterator pattern like this is common to many
languages — CLU had a special-purpose iterator construct, Smalltalk
uses a general-purpose closure mechanism to implement it as a pattern,
and Ruby bears the traces of having switched from the CLU approach to
the Smalltalk approach, plus a little syntactic sugar.  The C++ STL is
famously based entirely on “iterators”, but they use a totally
different design which is not as amenable to streams.  Python’s
approach is somewhat derived from Icon’s, whch is derived from
SNOBOL’s, which is derived from backtracking for string processing.
Prolog implementations can also generate a sequence of possibilities
in constant space by backtracking.</p>
<p>This approach goes back to the earliest days of computing; not only
did business data processing in COBOL typically work by reading one or
a few records into the very limited memory of the time, but some early
machines like Turing’s Pilot ACE exposed the sequential nature of
their delay-line memories.  And in some sense, this is what’s
happening at the lowest levels of a CPU: the CPU registers are
constant space, and they are used to lazily materialize sequences of
values laboriously retrieved from main memory.</p>
<h2>Constant-space lists</h2>
<p>This may just be Sutherland’s idea from Sketchpad, but what if our
fundamental memory mutation operation is to move an object from one
list to another?</p>
<p>Let’s say a given type of object participates in a given set of
intrusive lists, which we can treat as fields of the object.  These
lists are doubly-linked, so removing a linked object from one such
list is easy, as is inserting an unlinked object before or after a
linked object.  Combining these two operations gives us an atomic
move-between-lists operation.</p>
<p>This move-between-lists operation is constant-time and cannot fail.
Can it create garbage?  Yes, because the object you are moving may
have been the only surviving external reference to the list you are
removing it from.</p>
<p>(Heterogeneous lists presumably need some kind of run-time type
identification information to get from the list header to the entire
object, since different types of objects might have their list links
at different field offsets.)</p>
<h2>I give up on the microscopic view</h2>
<p>I was hoping to find a set of one or more operations that would give
me what I wanted: a way to manipulate flexible, irregular data
structures in constant time without the possibility of failure and
without creating garbage.  Clearly you can write a program that does
some kind of computation on flexible, irregular data structures in
constant time without the possibility of failure and without creating
garbage, and you can even prove these properties, but you I don’t know
how to do it by pushing those requirements down to the atomic level of
the program.</p>
<p>However, although you need some kind of less-local proof to establish
the safety of any of these approaches, the different sets of
primitives have different sets of proof obligations.  The Z-machine
approach, for example, only requires that you prove that you aren’t
reparenting a node to be its own descendant; in many cases this is
easy, like when the node is a leaf node, or a node of a type that is
statically known not to occur in the ancestors of the destination, or
when the destination is closer to the root than the node being
reparented.  Similarly, the constant-space lists approach just
requires you to prove that there’s a reference somewhere else to the
list you’re removing the node from, or alternatively that it was the
only node in the list.</p>
<p>By contrast, the immutable Lisp approach requires you to prove that
there’s enough space for the node you’re allocating, perhaps because
you preallocated it — also simple, but very different.  It’s very
similar, though, to the kind of proof you need to do for constant-time
code, where instead of proving an upper bound on the amount of
allocation done by a function call, you prove an upper bound on the
amount of time it can use.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
