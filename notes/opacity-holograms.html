<p>We present an algorithm and example images demonstrating a new form
of full-color “holography” printable on a standard laser printer
that supports full parallax, rather than just one-dimensional
parallax, like lenticular 3D and unlike traditional full-color
holograms and Beaty’s “scratch holograms”.  Like Beaty’s design,
these “opacity holograms” do not take advantage of the wave nature
of light, but like interference holograms, measures of their quality
degrade only proportional to the square root of the number of
encoded frames, rather than linearly as with lenticular 3D.</p>

<p>Consider an image obscured by a grille, of the kind used for
cryptography in the past.  The grille is an opaque sheet with holes in
it.  When laid atop a ciphertext, a viewer sees portions of the
ciphertext where the holes are, and the color of the grille elsewhere,
which we will take to be black.</p>
<p>Naor and Shamir (1994) demonstrated how to use the grille approach to
optically perform a one-time pad encryption of a bilevel image.  The
present author extended this algorithm to grayscale images, without
loss of security, in a non-peer-reviewed publication in 2007.</p>
<p>The present work demonstrates an extension in a different direction:
discarding security entirely as an objective, it uses N random
grilles, or equivalently N spatial shifts of the same random grille,
to optically decode approximations of N unrelated plaintext images
from a single encoded image, with the addition of Gaussian noise with
a standard deviation of O(√N) added, resulting in an O(1) loss of
intensity and contrast, and an O(√N) loss of effective resolution. XXX
If the grille is physically mounted parallel to and a short distance
away from the encoded image — for example, by printing them on
opposite sides of transparency film or float glass — these spatial
shifts can be achieved merely by viewing the assemblage from slightly
different angles.</p>
<p>From here on, we will speak of N grilles, one for each input image,
and we will speak of the image as grayscale, with possible values
ranging from -1.0 black to +1.0 white; but everything generalizes to
the cases of RGB images and N spatial shifts of a random grille.  For
the time being, we will take the grille’s distribution to be 25% open
holes, a number we will call L, and 75% opaque black.</p>
<p>The encoded image is a pixelwise sum of N different encoded subimages,
each generated from a single plaintext image.  A given pixel in the
encoded image from among those visible through a hole in a particular
grille consists of the corresponding pixel of the input image, plus
Gaussian noise from the other subimages.  If the noise has a uniform
distribution with a mean at 0 across the entire image, then it will
merely decrease the effective resolution of the image.</p>
<p>How can we get the sum of the other subimages to have a spatially
uniform zero-centered Gaussian distribution?  Consider each pixel in
each subimage as a random variable, which with some probability shows
through a hole in that subimage’s grille and therefore must be equal
to the original image’s pixel, and otherwise can be chosen to have any
value.  By the Law of Large Numbers, the sum of the corresponding
pixels in each subimage will tend to be Gaussian with a variance that
is the sum of the variances of the pixels in each subimage.  So we are
faced with the task of ensuring that this sum of N-1 subimages has
mean 0 at each pixel and has a spatially uniform variance, even though
with some significant probability the values of the pixels in
particular subimages are fully determined by the corresponding input
image pixel.</p>
<p>So, a given pixel in a given subimage might have some plaintext value,
such as -.21, with probability L = 0.25, and be a free choice
otherwise, while some other pixel in that same subimage might have a
different plaintext value, such as .99, with probability 0.25, and be
a free choice otherwise.  The problem is making the free choice such
that the mean of both distributions is zero and the variance is equal.</p>
<p>Getting the mean to be zero is easy: the naïve approach would be to
always pick, for example, .07 for the first pixel and -.33 for the
second one, when the choice is available.  But an encoded subimage
generated using this naïve algorithm will have widely varying
variances, and worse, they will tend to vary in a spatially coherent
way — where the plaintext image is close to medium gray, it will add
almost no noise to the other subimages, while where it is close to
black or white, it will add a great deal of noise.  This will result
in crosstalk visible in the decoded images.</p>
<p>The simplest way of fixing this defect of the naïve algorithm is
simply to compute the variance for each pixel, and add an additional
N+1th subimage purely of random noise with a compensating amount of
variance for each pixel.  (You could use a Gaussian distribution, or
you could try to construct a distribution that will bring the
distribution of the sum as close as possible to Gaussian.)  Another
possible way is to use more complicated distributions in each of the
subimages, perhaps shaped to be as close to perfectly Gaussian as
possible, so that the Law of Large Numbers kicks in immediately.  I
don’t know how much the higher moments of the noise distribution will
be visible, though.  And I don’t know how much this choice matters.</p>
<p>The final result image will, in general, have pixels outside the
[-1.0, 1.0] range, and so will require some amount of clipping.  We
can scale and translate its range somewhat (diminishing contrast) to
reduce the damage from clipping.  Translating values is more harmful
near -1.0, where it reduces contrast, than near +1.0, where it merely
reduces brightness.  Probably the most pragmatic approach is to do a
linear scaling such that, say, the 1st and 95th percentile values are
mapped to -1.0 and 1.0.  XXX calculate how much damage this does and
how it changes with the number of images.</p>
<p>However, a bilevel output device like a laser printer cannot reproduce
continuous grayscale; it can only produce black pixels and white
pixels.  We would like the probability of a pixel being white to be
proportional to its ideal whiteness, which we could do by XXX the
usual dithering approaches, no?  But it would be nice if we could
avoid adding still more noise, by like just thresholding at 0 or
something, but that would probably result in undesirably nonlinear
performance.</p>
<p>The grille’s load factor L (25% in the above) is independent of the
number of images, but it affects the effective resolution and the
noise levels.  Higher load factors L will result in proportionally
more noise (i.e. noise with a proportionally higher standard
deviation), but also proportionally more resolution.  But the noise
also affects the effective resolution: twice the noise requires four
times the resolution to compensate.  It would seem, then, that the
lower the load factor, the better, which of course is absurd, because
it implies that the optimum is L=0, a fully opaque grid.  This is
because the noise isn’t actually proportional to L; it’s proportional
to L/(1-L), which, hmm, that doesn’t fix the absurd conclusion, so
maybe that’s not it.  XXX</p>
<p>Thinking further about L.  To maximize effective resolution, we want
to maximize L/√(L/(1-L)).</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/optimization.html">Mathematical optimization</a> (29 notes)
