(3 minutes)</div><p>I found this paper from last year on a thing called DReX, which claims
to be “a declarative language for efficiently evaluating regular
string transformations”.  Apparently a “regular string transformation”
is a kind of transformational equivalent to a regular expression, and
they came up with a linear-time evaluation algorithm for it; “regular
string transformations” seem to be a thing they invented more or less
for the paper before this one.</p>
<p>I think their notation could use some work though.</p>
<p>One of their examples is a program to delete one-line comments from a
(C++) program; here’s the original version from DReX paper:</p>
<pre><code>del_slashes = split(del('/'), del('/')),
del_non_nl = iterate(del(x ≠ '\n')),
del_comm = split(del_slashes, del_non_nl),
del_comm_line = split(del_comm, del('\n')).
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s an inlined version:</p>
<pre><code>split(split(split(del('/'), del('/')), iterate(del(x ≠ '\n'))), del('\n'))
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s an RPN version:</p>
<pre><code>'/' del '/' del split x '\n' ≠ del iterate split '\n' del split
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s an infix/postfix version:</p>
<pre><code>'/' del, '/' del, x ≠ '\n' del*, '\n' del
</code></pre>
<p>How is this different from sed or whatever?  Would this maybe work as
an editor user interface?</p>
<p>They say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…regular string transformations is a… class that strikes a balance
between decidability and expressiveness.  In particular this class
captures transformations that involve reordering of input chunks, it
is closed under composition, it has decidable equivalence…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So DReX is a combinator-based DSL that covers exactly this class with
a prototype linear-time implementation (polynomial-time in program
size, linear-time in input size).</p>
<p>The DReX combinators are:</p>
<ul>
<li>φ → d, where φ is a predicate and d is a function: maps any
  character a that satisfies φ(a) to d(a);</li>
<li>split(f, g), which is unambiguous concatenation;</li>
<li>iterate(f), which is unambiguous Kleene closure;</li>
<li>combine(f, g), which applies both f and g to the same string and
  concatenates their results (unambiguous intersection);</li>
<li>f else g, which falls back to g if f fails (unambiguous union); and</li>
<li>chain(f, R), where R is a regexp for tokenizing, which applies f to
  pairs of tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Split, iterate, and chain also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>have a left-additive version in which the outputs computed on each
split of the string are concatenated in reverse order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently the domains of DReX functions are in some sense inspectable
and don’t include the whole universe of strings.  Their only primitive
combinator is the → combinator, whose domain I guess is the set of
characters for which φ returns true.</p>
<p>They come up with this definition for “consistent” that allows fast
(linear-time) evaluation and argue that it “does not sacrifice
expressiveness”.  Interestingly, even though regular string
transformations are closed under composition, they don’t include
composition because it makes the evaluation-problem PSPACE-complete,
so their definition of “does not sacrifice expressiveness” may be
counterintuitive.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
