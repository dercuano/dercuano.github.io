(6 minutes)</div><p>The recently-revealed continuing leaks of radioactive contaminants
from Fukushima, although they are 500 times smaller than the initial
release and 100 million times smaller than the natural radioactivity
of the Pacific Ocean, could still be dangerous to local ecology and
human health, but does not represent a global catastrophe.</p>
<p>This is my conclusion as a non-expert in the field summarizing the
publicly available information.  It could be wrong.</p>
<p>Details follow.</p>
<p>Different accounts give different amounts of radioactive water leaked
into the Pacific from the Fukushima nuclear plant via continuing
leaks.  Some of them give the amount, rather uselessly, in tons, but
the better accounts give the amount of radioactive material in the
water in becquerels.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSI3Rke8Zp4" title="FUKUSHIMA: 1 Quadrillion Bq Radioactive Water Discharged into the Pacific Ocean since May 2011">One TV report</a> says it's a PBq, but that
sounds like it's probably referring to part of the initial, much
larger release; other reports give the amount as 10 to 50 TBq: <a href="http://www.blindbatnews.com/2013/08/more-fukushima-fallout-30-trillion-becquerels-of-strontium-floods-pacific-ocean/23050" title="More Fukushima Fallout: 30 trillion becquerels of radiation floods Pacific Ocean!

Kiger, 2013-08-07">National Geographic's
article</a> gives the groundwater concentration of radioactive cesium
in places as around 1kBq/kg, gives the total release as 0.3 TBq/month,
describes the immediate aftermath of the disaster as a release of
around 10PBq, and contextualizes it by comparing to the 89 TBq release
of cesium-137 from the Hiroshima bombing.</p>
<p>The raw becquerel numbers are sort of meaningless without context on
how big a becquerel is.  <a href="http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/forum/218/are-fish-pacific-ocean-and-japanese-coastal-and-inland-waters-safe-eat-16-months-after-fuk" title="Are fish from the Pacific Ocean and Japanese coastal and inland waters safe to eat 16 months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster?">Mijlkovic's 2012 article</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9.3 percent of the catches exceeded Japan’s official ceiling for
  cesium, which is 100 becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg). ... Canada’s
  much higher ceiling, which is 1,000 Bq/kg</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm" title="Natural radioactivity">Comparing to natural radioactivity</a>, typical rocks and dirt have
hundreds of Bq/kg, mostly due to potassium, but with significant
amounts due to uranium, thorium, and radium.  Seawater has on the
order of 10 Bq/kg, almost all due to potassium.  A human body contains
on the order of 10 kBq, mostly due to potassium and carbon-14.  The
Pacific Ocean naturally contains about 7000 EBq, because it contains
about 700 million km³ of water.</p>
<p>That means that, purely in terms of increased radioactivity, the leak
is so small as to be insignificant.  A 70 TBq leak of radioactivity
would be 100 000 000 times smaller than the natural radioactivity of
the Pacific Ocean.  Increasing the radioactivity by one part in a
hundred million is not dangerous; if all radioactivity were
equivalent, it wouldn't even be detectable.  Even the initial 10PBq
release was only enough to increase total Pacific Ocean radiation by
about one part per million.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium-137#Health_risk_of_radioactive_caesium">fatal dose of cesium-137</a> is on the order of 100MBq/kg for
dogs.  So a 70TBq leak, if not sufficiently diluted, is enough to kill
about 700 000 kilograms of dogs or other similar animals, such as
people — about ten thousand people.</p>
<p>However, it's sensible to have different safety limits for different
radioactive elements, because some of them, like potassium, are
biologically regulated at a constant level — so eating more
radioactive potassium probably doesn't increase your exposure to
radiation at all — while others bioaccumulate, like strontium-90,
which replaces calcium in your bones and can therefore continue
irradiating you for the rest of your life.  Cesium bioaccumulates to
some extent, so it becomes more concentrated in animals than in
plants, more concentrated in predators than in herbivores, and more
concentrated still in secondary predators like tuna.  Tritium, a third
radioactive contaminant in this case, is not known to bioaccumulate,
but it also isn't homeostatically bioregulated like potassium;
chemically, it's almost identical to hydrogen.</p>
<p>Also, the radioactive material is not evenly distributed.
Ocean-caught fish from near the Fukushima reactor had levels up to
tens of kBq/kg in 2012, hundreds of times higher than normal fish, and
we can reasonably expect that fish that feed in areas where the water
has been released will continue to be contaminated to much higher than
normal levels, perhaps 100 times higher than normal.  However, it's
believed that the water that has leaked has already had most of its
radioactive cesium removed, unlike the water that leaked early on;
strontium-90 may be a bigger concern now.</p>
<p>So there are real health concerns, but they are not very large with
the current size of the leak.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/08/130807-fukushima-radioactive-water-leak/" title="Fukushima's Radioactive Water Leak: What You Should Know, Patrick J. Kiger, 2013-08-07">National Geographic article</a> says that the total amount of
contaminated water stored, now and in the future, is on the order of a
million tons; only a third of that is there now.  Unfortunately, I
don't have a good handle on how many becquerels that water contains.
It appears that the total water loss was 300 tons, mixing into 400
tons per day of groundwater; that gives us roughly 30 TBq/300 tons or
11 MBq/kg, about a million times more radioactive than natural
seawater.  A million tons of 11MBq/kg water would add up to 10PBq,
roughly the same size as the initial Fukushima disaster.  So, in a
worst-case scenario where all the tanks vented into the ocean, it
would be roughly comparable to the initial incident, and despite
bioaccumulation of strontium, probably would not be enough to cause
more than local ecological damage.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/energy.html">Energy</a> (63 notes)
