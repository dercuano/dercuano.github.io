(3 minutes)</div><p>The CandyFab did 3-D printing in sugar by blowing hot air onto the
sugar to melt it, a process that requires delicate temperature control
to avoid caramelizing the sugar all the way to carbon foam.</p>
<p>But carbon foam is in some ways a more useful material than sugar.  It
has a much higher strength-to-weight ratio, it's vastly more
heat-resistant, it's less dense, and often it can be prepared as a
conductor or an insulator depending on processing temperature.</p>
<p>In addition to hot air, you can also convert sugar to carbon foam by
dripping or squirting concentrated sulfuric acid on it, every
high-school chemistry teacher's favorite scary chemical reaction.  In
a powder-bed 3-D printing process like that used by the CandyFab, this
permits you to selectively deposit carbon foam in a sugar powder bed.
This could be useful for a couple of different reasons: first, you
might have fillers that are sensitive to the heat needed to melt
sugar, but not to sulfuric acid, perhaps styrofoam beads or something
similar; and, second, you might be able to inject the sulfuric acid
more precisely or more quickly than you can inject the heat.  In <a href="../notes/needle-binder-injection-printing.html">Needle binder injection printing</a> I outlined a variant of this
process that would work well with sulfuric acid as the "binder" being
injected deep within the powder bed.</p>
<p>A third possibility is injecting a susceptor, then "baking" the whole
powder bed with microwaves or with a dielectric heater; for example,
vegetable oil should be a sufficient susceptor to dehydrate sugar in a
domestic microwave oven, but other candidates include silicon carbide,
graphite, and magnetite.  These should work with other kinds of
powder-bed processes that require post-heating as well, like those
described in <a href="../notes/flux-deposition.html">3-D printing by flux deposition</a>, enabling more rapid heating of
large powder-bed-embedded objects than can be achieved by heat
conduction alone.</p>
<p>Possible fillers for this process are highly varied, and they can be
selectively deposited in the powder bed, as fluxing agents are in the
process described in <a href="../notes/flux-deposition.html">3-D printing by flux deposition</a>.  The simplest is
powdered, sieved coke, which will simply produce a denser carbon foam
and costs US$0.70/kg, according to <a href="../notes/powder-bed-3d-printing.html">Likely-feasible non-flux-deposition powder-bed 3-D printing processes</a>.  The
cheapest is silica sand for construction, US$0.012/kg; carbon foam
ought to stick well enough to that.  An alternative to sugar that
similarly foams up by dehydration, and sticks fabulously to silica, is
dried sodium silicate (waterglass), US$1.10/kg.  Copper or brass
(US$4/kg) could form conductive traces; steel wool or glass fiber
(US$6/kg) could provide tensile strength.</p>
<p>Sugar, being water-soluble, can also be used as a binder simply by
squirting a bit of water onto it; but it will virtually never dry out
by itself at room temperature --- you'd have to bake it.</p>
<p>(A quick stovetop experiment shows that granulated table sugar, when
heated to dehydration, is able to bind construction sand together at
about 25% sugar, but not at about 10% sugar.  Presumably this depends
not only on the quantities of sugar and sand but also their grain size
distributions.  Even at 25% sugar, the mass is quite crumbly; it
disintegrates with a touch.  50% sugar is quite a bit more solid.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/materials.html">Materials</a> (112 notes)
