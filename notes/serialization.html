(8 minutes)</div><p>I find myself somewhat unexpectedly desiring a new serialization
format for Python data structures.  This is unexpected because
Python’s standard library already includes several serialization
formats: pickle, marshal, json, and xmlrpclib (not counting xdrlib,
ConfigParser, and struct), and other formats such as bencode are also
widely used in Python.</p>
<p>(bencode might actually be the right solution, but I can’t look at the
internet to see right now.)</p>
<p>I’m defining a network protocol for a program I’m writing, and one of
the things I want to do in this protocol is to pass Python data
structures over the wire.  I’m not concerned with being able to
serialize arbitrary class instances — I’d be satisfied with built-in
data types — but I don’t want a lot of hassle.</p>
<p>The serialization needs to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure — all of pickle, marshal, and xmlrpclib have warnings against
  using them on data from potentially malicious sources, leaving only
  json of the standard modules.</li>
<li>Self-describing — it must be possible to deserialize a serialized
  value without referring to some external schema information.</li>
<li>Self-delimiting — it must be possible to deserialize a serialized
  value from a byte stream and then continue using the byte stream,
  for example to deserialize another value that follows it.  This rules
  out json; I think it rules out bencode but I’m not sure.</li>
<li>Dependency-free — its implementation code must be self-contained.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, the serialization would also be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to implement, improving its chances of being secure.</li>
<li>Fairly transparent, supporting the full range of commonly-used
  built-in Python data types, preserving the tuple-list distinction,
  the int-float distinction, the bytes-unicode distinction, non-string
  dict keys, Booleans, None, and maybe even sets.</li>
<li>Hashable, in the sense that a given Python value is representable by
  only a single possible byte stream.</li>
<li>Capable of serializing class instances, optionally, with an explicit
  namespace of supported classes.</li>
<li>Devoid of arbitrary format limitations, such as limiting strings to
  2³² bytes.</li>
<li>Pure ASCII except when it’s encoding strings that aren’t.</li>
<li>Reasonably efficient.</li>
<li>Supportable on other programming languages, including old versions
  of Python.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it does not need to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to type by hand.  (So length fields are okay.)</li>
<li>Super efficient.</li>
<li>Capable of serializing functions and/or closures and/or generators.</li>
<li>Capable of serializing exotic or very stateful Python types like
  Ellipsis, xranges, code objects, type objects, memoryviews, file
  objects, and complex numbers.</li>
<li>Capable of representing and restoring sharing or circular data
  structures.</li>
<li>Super easy to read.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Length-free design</h2>
<pre><code>val ::= bytes | unicode | tuple | list | dict | boolean | none | int | float
bytes ::= '"' stringcontents
unicode ::= 'u"' stringcontents
stringcontents ::= '"' | stringbyte stringcontents
stringbyte ::= [^"\] | '\"' | '\\'
tuple ::= '(' tuplecontents
tuplecontents ::= ')' | val tuplecontents
list ::= '[' listcontents
listcontents ::= ']' | val listcontents
dict ::= "{" dictcontents
dictcontents ::= "}" | val val dictcontents
boolean ::= "T" | "F"
none ::= "N"
int ::= sign digits " "
digits ::= [0-9] | [0-9] digits
float ::= sign digits "e" sign digits " "
sign ::= "-" |
</code></pre>
<p>The pairs of vals in a dict are key-value pairs.  Dict keys must
appear in sorted order by the lexicographical ordering of their
serializations.  Unicode strings are represented in UTF-8.  The only
whitespace allowed is that within strings and that following numbers.
The only case where the next byte is not sufficient to dispatch to the
appropriate routine is the int/float dichotomy.  Yes, floats are
expressed without decimal points, so "31416e-4 " is a reasonable
representation for an approximation of π.</p>
<p>In practice this should be slightly more compact than bencode except
for large binary strings (which it inflates on average by almost 1%
but by 100% in the worst case), and much more readable and writable,
but considerably slower and more error-prone.</p>
<p>As an example, <code>{"announce-list": [["foo"], ["bar"]], "info":
{"files": [{"length": 4541, "path": "baz", "safe": False}], (): (1,
1.0)}}</code> would be represented as
<code>{"announce-list"[["foo"]["bar"]]"info"{"files"[{"length"4541
"path""baz""safe"F}]()(1 1e0 )}}</code>.</p>
<h2>Length-prefixed design</h2>
<pre><code>val ::= bytelength body
bytelength ::= digits
digits ::= [0-9] | [0-9] digits
body ::= bytes | unicode | tuple | list | dict | boolean | none | int | float
bytes ::= 'H' data
unicode ::= 'u' data
data ::= "" | [\x00-\xff] data
tuple ::= '(' vals
vals ::= "" | val vals
list ::= '[' vals
dict ::= "{" pairs
pairs ::= "" | val val pairs
boolean ::= "T" | "F"
none ::= "N"
int ::= " " sign digits
float ::= "." sign digits "e" sign digits
sign ::= "-" |
</code></pre>
<p>Here every <code>val</code> begins with a decimal representation of the number of
bytes in the body of its serialization, not counting the initial type
byte.</p>
<p>As an example, <code>{"announce-list": [["foo"], ["bar"]], "info":
{"files": [{"length": 4541, "path": "baz", "safe": False}], (): (1,
1.0)}}</code>, the same example value from before, would be represented as
<code>100{13Hannounce-list14[6[3Hfoo6[3Hbar4Hinfo58{5Hfiles36[33{6Hlength4
45414Hpath3Hbaz4Hsafe1F0(8(1 13.1e0</code>.  This is about 10% bigger than
the length-free design, and a hell of a lot harder to type or read,
especially the parts that seem to say “45414H” and “13.1e0”, but can
be navigated efficiently and can support large chunks of binary data.</p>
<h2>Stack-based design</h2>
<p>Pickle deserializes by interpreting stack-based bytecode similar to
Python bytecode (which leads one to wonder why they didn’t just use
Python bytecode).  The pickle-version-0 encoding of the sample datum
<code>{"announce-list": [["foo"], ["bar"]], "info": {"files": [{"length":
4541, "path": "baz", "safe": False}], (): (1, 1.0)}}</code> is the following
188 bytes:</p>
<pre><code>(dp0
S'info'
p1
(dp2
S'files'
p3
(lp4
(dp5
S'path'
p6
S'baz'
p7
sS'length'
p8
I4541
sS'safe'
p9
I00
sas(t(I1
F1.0
tp10
ssS'announce-list'
p11
(lp12
(lp13
S'foo'
p14
aa(lp15
S'bar'
p16
aas.
</code></pre>
<p>Here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a</code> appends an item to a list,</li>
<li><code>s</code> appends a name-value pair to a dict,</li>
<li><code>(</code> pushes a PostScript-style mark,</li>
<li><code>t</code> forms a tuple from the items down to the PostScript-style mark,</li>
<li><code>l</code> forms a list (down to the mark),</li>
<li><code>d</code> forms a dict,</li>
<li><code>S</code>, <code>I</code>, and <code>F</code> encode strings, ints, and floats (up to the end of
  the line),</li>
<li><code>p</code> names the item on top of the stack so it can be referred to later
  if there are more references to it, and</li>
<li><code>.</code> ends the pickle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I have no idea why pickle incrementally appends stuff to lists
and dicts as it builds them.
<code>pickle.loads("(S'foo'\nS'bar'\nS'baz'\nI37\nd.")</code> does return
<code>{'foo': 'bar', 'baz': 37}</code> as you would expect, and changing the <code>d</code>
to an <code>l</code> generates the corresponding list.  So I don’t know why <code>a</code>
and <code>s</code> exist.</p>
<p>If you wanted to take this approach to make your serialization and
deserialization as little code as possible, you could use this
approach:</p>
<pre><code>op ::= digits intop | '(' | '}' | ']' | ')' | 'T' | 'F' | 'N' | LF
intop ::= ' ' | '-' | 'H' data | 'u' data | 'F' data
digits ::= [0-9] | [0-9] digits
data ::= "" | [\x00-\xff] data
</code></pre>
<p>Here the '}', ']', and ')' ops play the role of 'd', 'l', and 't' in
pickle; LF plays the role of '.'; ' ' specifies that the preceding
digits just represent an integer (and '-' is the same, but negates
it); 'H' and 'u' specify that the preceding digits are a count of
following bytes for a byte string or UTF-8-encoded Unicode string; and
'F' represents a floating-point number in some way that I’m not
specifying right now.</p>
<p>As an example, <code>{"announce-list": [["foo"], ["bar"]], "info":
{"files": [{"length": 4541, "path": "baz", "safe": False}], (): (1,
1.0)}}</code> would be represented as
<code>(13Hannounce-list((3Hfoo](3Hbar]]4Hinfo[5Hfiles((6Hlength4541
4Hpath3Hbaz4HsafeF}]()(1 1F1)}}\n</code>, which is one byte longer than the
length-free design, but retains most of the efficiency advantage of
the length-prefixed design.  I'm not sure there’s a meaningful
difference, really...</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
