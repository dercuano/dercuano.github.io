(5 minutes)</div><p>Memoization is a fairly general technique for making pure functions
faster to compute, particularly in the presence of incremental changes
to input data, but it usually has to be applied judiciously.  The
memoization runtime overhead on a function call is fairly large
compared to a primitive function call (a bit larger than an order of
magnitude), the space overhead of the memoized arguments and return
values is potentially many orders of magnitude larger than that of the
original program.  To make things more complicated, some functions are
worth memoizing because, although they run for less than a
microsecond, they are called many thousands of times per second, while
others are worth memoizing because, although they are only called a
few times per second, they run for tens of milliseconds; and,
furthermore, if a function A does most of its work in a function B,
and function B is mostly called by function A, it may be the case that
either A or B is worth memoizing, but not both A and B, since
memoizing either of them will dramatically reduce the cost of the
other.  Finally, two functions C and D, which would seem to be equally
worth memoizing given their respective runtime costs, might have
vastly different memory costs to memoize, and so we might vastly
prefer to memoize the one that will use less space.</p>
<p>In the face of all of this uncertainty, I propose that perhaps a
simple and reasonably effective way to figure out what to memoize may
be to scan the stack at every minor garbage collection (a task which
cannot be omitted from garbage collection in any case) and note the
particular activation records currently present upon it.  If our
activation records are in fact allocated on the heap in the nursery,
then GCs almost cannot fail to occur regularly during ordinary
computation, so the probability for an activation record to be present
at garbage-collection time is a good approximation of how much
computation time it represents.  If we then evacuate these activation
records to the next generation, they will then be safe from minor
garbage collection, and furthermore if we mutate them by writing a
pointer to their eventual return value into them, the write barrier
will shanghai the return value from the nursery into their generation
upon the next minor collection.</p>
<p>This, then, should provide us with a reasonably good facsimile of a
memoization policy that retains in memory the activation records of
calls whose past results we are likely to wish to consult once more.
Still, it cannot yet inform us of which <em>functions</em> we ought to
instrument with a memo-table probe, nor does it of itself organize
them into a queryable memo table.  After all, even if dozens of
activation records for a given function are copied out of the nursery,
that function might be called dozens of times with different
arguments, or dozens of millions; in the second case it may not be
worth patching memoization overhead into the function’s preamble!</p>
<p>But let’s suppose that we come up with some kind of approach to
solving these problems, like the invocation counter HotSpot uses to
decide which methods to optimize harder, sweeping the second
generation to collect saved activation records into a table when it’s
time to collect it, and estimating the amount of otherwise-garbage
that each activation record hauls out of the nursery, or something.</p>
<p>A really strange benefit of this memoization mechanism is that it can
possibly memoize functions whose return value turned out to be very
expensive to compute even from the very first time they are invoked,
with no ahead-of-time indication that they will be expensive.  As long
as they lived long enough and survived enough nursery collections,
their return value will be properly saved, and future invocations will
be able to use it.</p>
<p>With a sufficiently powerful and clever memoization mechanism, you
could replace most or all intermediate data structures in a program
with function calls that purported to compute a value from the
original (externally provided) inputs, and trust that if those
functions take a long enough time to run, then their return values
will be stored in a hash table without any explicit intervention on
your part.  The best thing about that is that you wouldn’t have to
worry about when to update those intermediate data structures or how
much of them to update.  This is probably kind of a fantasy, though.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
