(4 minutes)</div><p>Here's a second whack at the problem of designing a Lisp dialect that
lets you write array operations in terms of pointwise transformations,
by means of static dependent type inference, in order to avoid
run-time type and bounds checks.</p>
<p>First, array indexing.  Arrays are a kind of function, but unlike
other functions, you can find their bounds with the expression (bounds
anArray).  Arrays always take only a single argument, which can be
either an integer within their bounds, or a vector of integers within
their bounds.</p>
<p>Second, because vectors are so fundamental, there's a special syntax
to construct zero-based vectors: [a b c d ...], which kind of looks
like Scheme's #(...)  syntax but doesn't quote, so it's semantically
more like Python's list syntax or Squeak's { a. b. c } syntax.</p>
<p>So if you have a vector x and you want its fourth element, you can
write (x 3) or (x [3]).  As special syntactic sugar, if you leave out
the space before the [, you get an extra layer of list wrapped around:
x[3] is equivalent to (x [3]).</p>
<p>The (define ...) form from Scheme supports an extra feature not found
in R5RS, which is already in MzScheme --- the thing being defined can
be arbitrarily deeply nested on the left side.  So all three of these
definitions are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>(define x (lambda (y) (lambda (z) (+ y z))))
(define (x y) (lambda (z) (+ y z)))
(define ((x y) z) (+ y z))
</code></pre>
<p>This is so that you can define array-valued functions conveniently:</p>
<pre><code>(define (matrix-multiply m n)[i j] (sum k (* m[k j] n[i k])))
</code></pre>
<p>syntactic sugar for
    (define ((matrix-multiply m n) [i j]) (sum k (* m[k j] n[i k])))</p>
<p>(bounds anArray) returns the bounds of the array as a vector of
2-element vectors, each indicating the minimal valid index and one
more than the maximal valid index.  So a 2x3 array that's all
zero-based would have a bounds of [[0 2] [0 3]].</p>
<p>It is an error to construct non-rectangular matrices, because they
don't have bounds that can be expressed in the above form.</p>
<p>For each array-valued function, the compiler infers a function that
constructs the bounds of the resulting array from the bounds of its
arguments.  The bounds of the result are the widest possible bounds
that the compiler can guarantee will not result in out-of-bounds
accesses to any other array.  Some arrays constructed by functions may
be infinite, such as the generalized identity matrix (or Kronecker
delta?):</p>
<pre><code>(define identity[i j] (if (= i j) 1 0))
</code></pre>
<p>There's a (narrow newbounds array) form that can be used to
artificially narrow the bounds of some array.  It ensures that the new
bounds don't include any values excluded by the old ones.</p>
<pre><code>(define (nidentity n) (narrow [[0 n] [0 n]] identity))
</code></pre>
<p>Of the matrix-multiply function earlier, we can infer:</p>
<ul>
<li>m and n must both be two-dimensional;</li>
<li>the first dimension of m must have the same range as the second
  dimension of n;</li>
<li>the first dimension of the result has the same range as the first
  dimension of n;</li>
<li>the second dimension of the results has the same range as the second
  dimension of m.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a (valid? expr) form which checks whether expr would cause a
bounds error, without actually evaluating expr; the compiler can
use this to infer bounds-construction functions.</p>
