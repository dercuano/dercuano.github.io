<p>I think I have a method for reducing the computational expense of a
large and interesting class of FIR filters by an order of magnitude or
so, but I haven't tried it out yet, and it seems like the kind of
thing people would have tried by now, so it probably either won't work
or is already known.</p>
<p>In my case, this questionable insight came out of, among other things,
considering how to write timesheet software using functional reactive
programming, sweating through the night in the Buenos Aires heat wave
and blackouts, and considering whether it's possible to approximate
dense FIR kernels by convolving multiple sparse FIR kernels together.</p>
<p>I've tried to write this with some humor, although I think the result
is basically that I sound insane.  Hopefully that provides some
entertainment.  Don't take it too seriously.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>(This section is basically me regurgitating shit from Wikipedia and
dspguide.com, so feel free to skip it if you know DSP.  Or, better
yet, read it and correct me.)</p>
<p>FIR filters are common tools in DSP because they can easily be
designed to get zero-phase high-performance filters: you take the
inverse FFT of your desired frequency response, giving you the impulse
response, which you window to give it compact support without fucking
up the frequency response too much, and that gives you the weights for
your filter.  (Not the only method, but a common one.)</p>
<p>However, in many cases, you end up needing tens, hundreds, or even
thousands of multiply-accumulates per sample.  As a result, we often
use IIR filters to get better efficiency, even though we don't have a
general theory of how to design IIR filters.</p>
<h3>The moving-average filter</h3>
<p>The moving-average filter is a special case of a FIR filter: all the
weights within its support window are equal, so its impulse response
is a pulse, like one cycle of a square wave.  It's used for a couple
of reasons: (1) it's optimal in minimally degrading time-domain step
response while rejecting high-frequency noise, and (2) it's highly
efficient.</p>
<p>If you implement it in the general FIR fashion --- multiplying each of
the last N input samples by a weight, then adding them --- it's not
any more efficient than any other FIR filter with the same support.
But you can implement it much more efficiently than that, because
composition of time-invariant linear operators is commutative.</p>
<p>Specifically, the impulse response of the moving average filter is the
integral (or prefix sum) of a very sparse kernel: a single positive
impulse at the beginning of the window, and a single equal negative
impulse at the end.  Integration (or prefix sum) is a time-invariant
linear operator, as is convolution with a given kernel.  So what you
do is that you first convolve the input signal with the derivative (or
finite forward difference) of the desired impulse response, which
requires only two multiply-accumulates per sample, since that
derivative is so sparse; then you integrate (or prefix-sum) the
result of the convolution; and the commutative property guarantees you
that the result is the same.  So you get by with two MACs and an
addition per sample.</p>
<p>(Actually, because the two impulses are equal in magnitude, you can
wait until the very end of the process to multiply by the weight,
giving you three additions/subtractions and a single multiply per
sample.  Sweet.)</p>
<h3>Polynomial splines</h3>
<p>A spline is when you approximate a function by breaking it up into
chunks along the X-axis and approximate each chunk with a different
polynomial.  Typically the polynomials produce the same value at the
points where they join up, the "knots", which is to say, the spline is
at least continuous, and usually has a continuous derivative too.
(Normally you have the constraint that a spline made out of Nth-order
polynomials has continuous derivatives up to order N - 1.)</p>
<p>Typically you can get a pretty good approximation of an analytic
function with second- or third-degree polynomials, and without all
that many of them.  This is a lot less computation than using a
high-order approximating polynomial, and as a scrumptious bonus, it
also avoids Runge's phenomenon.  So this is actually the approach used
by a lot of math libraries these days.</p>
<p>(This suggests that the Difference Engine could have been quite a bit
smaller if equipped with a facility to reload the highest-order
difference from a table periodically, at knots; it could perhaps have
used three or four columns instead of eight.)</p>
<h2>Efficiently approximating FIR kernels with splines</h2>
<p>The standard efficient method for computing the moving average filter
can be generalized to a wide class of FIR kernels, producing a worse
but still very substantial computational speedup.</p>
<h3>Step function OTFs</h3>
<p>A moving average filter is of the family of step functions: piecewise
constant functions.  That's why its derivative (or forward difference)
has such sparse support.</p>
<p>But you could in principle compute a convolution with any piecewise
constant OTF by convolving with the derivative and then integrating.</p>
<h3>Step functions and splines</h3>
<p>If you integrate a piecewise-constant function, you get a continuous
piecewise-linear function; if you integrate that, you get a continuous
piecewise-quadratic function with a continuous derivative; and if you
integrate that, you get a piecewise-cubic function with continuous
zeroth, first, and second derivatives.  Which is to say, you get a
polynomial spline.</p>
<p>If it happens that your desired impulse response can be approximated
by an Nth-order spline with a small number of points, then you can fit
that spline to it; take the N+1th forward difference to get a sparse
kernel; apply that sparse kernel to your input data; and integrate its
output N+1 times to get the filtered output.</p>
<p>For each sample, this requires one multiply-accumulate per spline knot
plus N+1 additions for an Nth-order spline.</p>
<h3>Desired frequency response containing no low frequencies</h3>
<p>This section is incomplete.</p>
<p>This is going to suck if your desired impulse response is very wiggly,
though, because I think that in general (certainly with a second-order
spline), you'll need two knots for each oscillation.  If the
wavelength of your oscillations is only like six or eight samples,
then you're not going to be saving much.</p>
<p>I think, based on basically no experience, this kind of wiggliness
often shows up because you're trying to put together a high-pass or
bandpass filter, and so all your low frequencies are zero.  Which is
to say, your desired frequency response is the convolution of an
impulse at some high "base frequency" with some window function giving
the shape of the frequency response above that frequency.</p>
<p>If you shift the window function down closer to zero, you'll reduce
the wiggliness a lot, and you'll be able to get by with a lot less
knots.</p>
<p>So what good is that?  You'd have to somehow shift the signal down in
frequency, and then back up.  RF circuitry does this kind of
downconversion all the time by just multiplying the high-frequency
signal by a reference signal at a nearby frequency, thus producing sum
and difference frequencies[1], typically much lower (either near zero,
"baseband", or in some lower but still RF band, "intermediate
frequency").  This is easy enough to do (it requires one multiply per
sample, not even a multiply-accumulate).  But I have the impression
that this kind of downconversion and upconversion requires high-pass
or bandpass filtering before and after, which seems to be begging the
question, so I suspect this may be making the problem harder rather
than easier.  (Maybe you can use an inverted low-pass filter for your
high-pass filtering?  That shouldn't run into the wiggliness problem,
although you want to do the inversion separately from the spline
approximation.)</p>
<p>[1] If this is puzzling, remember the sum and difference identities
from trig class.  Or re-derive them from Euler's Formula.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you somehow manage to frequency-shift your input signal
down to baseband, then you can use a much less wiggly filter kernel on
it, and then multiply it by a carrier wave to upconvert it back to its
original frequency.</p>
<h3>Another incomplete approach for kernels containing no low frequencies</h3>
<p>Another possibly valid approach for wiggly kernels: note that N cycles
of a sine wave are the convolution of a comb filter with N impulses
spaced one cycle apart with a kernel consisting of a single cycle of
the sine wave.  You can thus convolve a kernel consisting of N cycles
of a sine wave with your signal (as if that were a useful thing to do,
but bear with me) by first convolving it with the comb filter, then
with the single cycle, for an almost N-fold reduction in computation
if the number of samples per cycle is large, or an almost
samples-per-cycle-fold reduction if N is large.</p>
<p>If you want instead to shape the sine wave with some kind of envelope,
you could make each impulse in the comb a different height, but that
is going to give you discontinuous derivatives and totally fuck up
your frequency response; those discontinuous derivatives are almost
like impulses in their wideband-noise nature.  You can do better by
making your second kernel be, rather than a <em>single</em> cycle, <em>two</em>
cycles, but windowed with a triangular window.  This way, in between
the comb points, you're linearly interpolating between two sine waves
with different amplitudes.</p>
<p>Getting back to the wiggly kernel, I think you can approximate it as
such an amplitude-modulated sine wave, with the frequency of the sine
being the "base frequency" I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>So how does this save you work over the spline approach?  Well, I
think you can use the spline approach to do the N-points modulated
comb filter in a lot less than O(N) work by round-robining among a
bunch of different intermediate signal buffers, one for each cycle per
sample.  But I haven't worked out the details yet, so I'm not sure it
will work.</p>
<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>I wrote the above while my internet connection was off, so I couldn't
search to see if anybody had already done this.</p>
<p>B-spline image interpolation might appear to be related, but it is
different.  This is a common algorithm for image interpolation
(upsampling, resolution enhancement) aka cubic B-spline interpolation,
where you construct a bicubic B-spline patch between adjacent pixels
in order to approximate the values between the pixels.  It turns out
that you can do this by applying a FIR filter to the image; that is to
say, the interpolated pixels of the upsampled image are a linear
function of the neighborhood pixels of the original image, even though
the splines are nonlinear.  This, approximating the ideal image with a
spline, is a very different concept from approximating the FIR kernel
itself with a spline.</p>
<p>"Kernel B-Splines and Interpolation", by Bozzini, Lennarduzzi, and
Schaback, 2005, appears to be about a variant of the image
interpolation problem (interpolating an unknown function between some
set of known points).</p>
<p>There's a substantial body of theory interpreting sampled signals as
ways of representing splines rather than bandlimited sums of
sinusoids; the methods mentioned above belong to that theory.  The
approach I'm discussing here does not, I think, belong to that family
of methods, but I'm not very familiar with the theory of spline image
processing.  So maybe it's in there somewhere.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (123 notes)
