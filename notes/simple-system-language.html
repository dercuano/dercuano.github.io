(7 minutes)</div><p>Reading about Rust, and having just written a raytracer that doesn't
use the heap and is almost trivially statically safe, it occurs to me
that you could probably do a lot better than OCaml efficiency-wise,
especially on modern hardware, without much more compilation
complexity.</p>
<p>The ML type system has basically one kind of immutable container,
which is like a variant record.  Typically this is implemented as a
type tag followed by a pointer for each value.  Many types only have
one variant.  Types can be parametric and recursive.</p>
<p>Here are the most basic type definitions from my raytracer:</p>
<pre><code>typedef float sc;               // scalar
typedef struct { sc x, y, z; } vec;
typedef vec color;              // So as to reuse dot(vv,vv) and scale
typedef struct { color co; sc reflectivity; char texture; } material;
typedef struct { vec cp; material ma; sc r; } sphere;
</code></pre>
<p>In memory, a <code>sphere</code> occupies nine contiguous 32-bit words:</p>
<pre><code>cp.x
cp.y
cp.z
ma.co.x
ma.co.y
ma.co.z
ma.reflectivity
ma.texture
r
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>texture</code> is one byte, but on almost all platforms, it will be padded
out, basically to align the <code>r</code> that follows it.  If you used parallel
arrays you could avoid this memory bloat.)</p>
<p>We can translate this same type definition into, say, OCaml:</p>
<pre><code>type sc = float
and vec = Vec of (sc * sc * sc)
and color = vec
and material = Material of (color * sc * char)
and sphere = Sphere of (vec * material * sc)
;;
</code></pre>
<p>The semantics are very similar, but with this definition, a <code>sphere</code>
is actually a graph of objects on the heap:</p>
<pre><code>Sphere
vec ----------------------------------- Vec
material -------- Material              sc -- float
sc -- float       color -- Vec          sc -- float
                  sc -- fl sc -- float  sc -- float
                  char     sc -- float
                           sc -- float
</code></pre>
<p>That's a total of 11 heap allocations.  If OCaml had unboxed floats,
it would be only 5, but even 5 is a lot.  If the boxed floats don't
need a separate in-memory type tag (I haven't looked), while the
others do, then this is a total of some 24 words, more than twice the
count for the C approach.  With in-memory type tags, the total is 32
words!</p>
<p>Now, this is clearly a problem with memory efficiency, but it gets
worse.  Half of those 24 words are pointers, and if the object
survives until a garbage collection, the garbage collector has 12
pointers to traverse, where it could have had zero.  And they're
likely to be in different cache lines (perhaps segregated by size in
different pages, to cut down on allocator space overhead), so if you
have a lot of spheres (I don't), you miss out on cache locality.</p>
<p>In a dynamically-typed language, these allocations really have to be
separate — there's no telling when you could replace the <code>Material</code>
with an integer or something.  And you might want some of the parts to
be shared with other objects, either because they're mutable or
because they're large.  But these objects are neither large, nor
mutable, nor do they vary in type (we might say "mode", to use the
Algol-68 term for in-memory representation).  And the cost of the
implementation strategy is clearly unacceptable.</p>
<p>"Sum types", that is, types with multiple possible representations,
more or less clearly need to be implemented with pointers:</p>
<pre><code>type 'a mylist = Mycons of ('a * 'a mylist) | Mynil ;;
</code></pre>
<p>both because they can be recursive (while being finite and acyclic)
and because their elements can vary in size.</p>
<p>There are, as I said, cases where you actually <em>want</em> aliasing
semantics, either because of mutability or because of size; the C and
Pascal approach to this — a type constructor like <code>^</code> such that <code>x^</code>
means "pointer to an x" — seems to me entirely harmonious with an
ML-style type system.</p>
<p>(You could lump mutability in with explicit pointerhood, since if
you're going to be changing the color of a sphere frequently you're
quite likely to want to be able to do that with a single operation
instead of three; that would be useful if you wanted a language with a
minimal number of features, like C; but in theory the two are
orthogonal features.)</p>
<p>This is similar to the approaches taken by Golang and Rust, but Golang
doesn't have full type inference.</p>
<p>By eliminating the majority of pointers from your heap, you eliminate
the majority of work for the garbage collector, reduce your memory
consumption, and probably dramatically improve locality of reference.
This makes garbage collection substantially cheaper.  It also makes
other memory-management disciplines substantially cheaper — for
example, single-ownership inherited deletion, or reference counting,
are much cheaper when you have fewer pointers.</p>
<p>Golang's approach to arrays and pointer arithmetic seems basically
sound, but it seems like it would work better if you could hoist array
bounds checks in more cases.</p>
<p>So what's the simplest compiler for a reasonably complete language
along these lines?  We can dispense with Schemeish simplifications
that simplify the language at the cost of complicating the compiler:
automatic closure of free variables, automatic tail-call detection,
and call-with-current-continuation.  OCaml further dispenses with
polymorphic arithmetic and implicit arithmetic type conversion,
showing that this is practical.  Scheme and Forth dispense with syntax
above the level of tokens, showing that this is practical.  If you're
going to have ML-style variant constructors, you can dispense with
conditional statements, but you still need loops if you're not going
to do automatic tail-call detection; and you still need a stack if
you're going to support recursion that isn't tail-recursion.  (And not
supporting recursion seems to me to go beyond just "not complicating
the compiler" into "turning implementation shortcuts into subtle
bugs".)</p>
<p>So you need functions, arithmetic, recursion, pattern-matching (with
iteration), type declarations, (mutable) pointers, and perhaps
variables; and you probably also need arrays, even if you don't use
them much, so you need array indexing; loops; assignments; and
sequences of statements.</p>
<p>The simplest way to get loops, other than tail recursion, is to have a
pattern-matching construct that repeats unless you break out of it.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>while (listnode) {
case Cons(a, b) -&gt;
    listnode := b;
    total_weight += weight(a);
case Nil -&gt; break;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Not sure that really compares well with C:</p>
<pre><code>for (; listnode; listnode = listnode-&gt;next) {
    total_weight += weight(listnode-&gt;item);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Hygienic macros — i.e. rewrite rules — may be a convenient way to
implement a fairly rich compiler fairly quickly.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
