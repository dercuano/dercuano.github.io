<p>To 3-d scan a Lambertian surface with a plain video camera and a
light:</p>
<p>Move a point source of light near a Lambertian surface as you capture
video from a camera stationary relative to the surface. Pixelwise
differences between frames show the effect of removing the source from
one frame and adding it to another. Hypothetically, ambient diffusion
from other reflectors contributes negligibly to this difference, since
the source is close to the surface being scanned. Given an estimated
depth for each pixel and per-frame estimated light locations in
3-space, you can compute a simulated frame difference, which you can
compare to the real frame difference to get an error. Each pixel of
this error is a nonlinear (?) function of ten unknowns: the two x, y,
z of the light locations, the estimated depth to that pixel, the
surface gradient depth at that object point, and the estimated
reflectance at that point. Given just one such error image, we can
optimize the two light locations to minimize the error using gradient
descent, holding the estimated depths fixed, or we can optimize the
depths</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
