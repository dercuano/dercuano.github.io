<p>By inverse-filtering the control signal applied to a plant by the
estimated OTF of the control function, we can compensate for
arbitrarily poor stiffness, up to limits imposed by the control-output
bounds and the Q factor of series resonances in the system which
impede our ability to impose rapid changes on it.  The estimated OTF
can be updated moment by moment from incoming sensor data, which
permits compensation for mild nonlinearities in the plant; for
example, the resonant frequencies of a robot arm may change as it is
being extended.  High-Q-factor series resonances impose notch filters
on the spectrum of the OTF, making it poorly conditioned, thus
requiring large components in the inverse filter.  These large
components can easily cause the inverse-filtered signal to have a very
poor signal-to-noise ratio or to exceed the limits of the control
actuators, requiring for example very large forces, velocities, or
displacements.  This problem can be ameliorated somewhat by using
nonlinear optimization algorithms, rather than simply solving a linear
system, in the control loop.  However, in many cases, it may be better
to change the design of the plant to damp the high-Q resonances.  For
example, in a mechanical system, these high-Q resonances can be damped
and broadened by adding dashpots or other dissipative elements, thus
trading off efficiency for precision control.  Counterintuitively, the
common approach of increasing rigidity can worsen the controllability
of the system when using such an adaptive control algorithm, as it
increases the Q factor of the system’s vibrational modes, even as it
moves them to higher frequencies.  As more data is gathered about the
system, it becomes possible to empirically estimate the variation of
the control-feedback OTF over the plant’s parameter space, thus
enabling compensation for OTF nonlinearities in parts of the parameter
space we expect to visit in the near future.  If the control system
can learn an OTF that is locally nonlinear or stateful, then nonlinear
optimization algorithms in the control loop could potentially
compensate even for such phenomena as gear backlash.  Finally, using a
self-validating analysis system such as reduced affine arithmetic, the
control system can optimize not only to reduce the expected deviation
between the plant’s state and the commanded result, but even for the
uncertainty in the plant’s state.</p>
<p>All of the above is, to me at least, still somewhat speculative.  I
have a strong intuition that all of it is true, but a lot of work is
needed to verify it in practice.  It’s about four times too long for a
paper abstract!</p>
<p>How to investigate?  Well, one thing to try is to simulate a simple
physical system, like maybe a linear one-dimensional
mass-spring-dashpot system connected to another mass-spring-dashpot
system plus a little bit of measurement noise, and try to command it
to make some movements with some different kinds of control systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe a simple bang-bang control system;</li>
<li>Simple proportional control;</li>
<li>A tuned PID control system;</li>
<li>The inverse-filtering-based system I describe above, in its simplest
  form;</li>
<li>maybe more advanced forms of it if that seems like it would be
  better.</li>
</ul>
<p>That should provide some kind of evidence that this is a good idea,
before I get into more complicated plants.</p>
<p>The obvious way to do the simulation at this point is with SVG and JS
in Chrome, using direct-mode solutions with maybe a second-degree
approximation for the integrals, which will also make it easy to
demonstrate to other people.  Maybe I can make it game-like, which
should make it easy to draw a desired motion with the mouse or a
touchscreen in order to see how different control systems respond.</p>
<p>Maybe I can try some experiments first with Jupyter notebooks with
Numpy to see what inverse-filtering a noisy signal looks like.  Maybe
I need to review how to compute the OTF of a linear mass-spring-
dashpot system, because I’m pretty sure that’s like a closed-form kind
of thing.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/optimization.html">Mathematical optimization</a> (29 notes)
