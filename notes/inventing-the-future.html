(1 minute)</div><p>Alan Kay, whose team invented object-oriented programming and the
modern graphical user interface, famously said, "The best way to
predict the future is to invent it."  If that's true, then the people
who <em>control</em> the future are the ones who are inventing it.  So let's
invent a future we want to live in!</p>
<p>Who are the people and projects inventing a future worth living in
today?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yochai Benkler, inventing the economics of the post-scarcity world.</li>
<li>Michel Bauwens, also, with his Peer-To-Peer Foundation.</li>
<li>Marcin Jakubowski, and his Factor e Farm/Open Source Ecology/Global
  Village Construction Set project.  See
  <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Marcin_Log">http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Marcin_Log</a> for what he's doing
  today.</li>
<li>Nick Mathewson and the rest of the Tor project, trying to enable
  anonymous speech in the age of the internet.</li>
<li>Kickstarter.</li>
<li>Wikipedia, which has organized the world's knowledge and made it
  universally accessible and useful, completing the project of
  Diderot's Encyclopédie a few hundred years late.  Jimmy Wales is its
  most visible spokesperson, but the vast majority of work is being
  done by thousands, if not tens of thousands, of volunteers.</li>
<li>The Internet Archive.</li>
