(1 minute)</div><p>I was thinking about chasing-the-beam-style raster-generation software
in low memory, and how to achieve smooth curves.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to rasterize some kind of shape.  You can approximate
the border of the shape in a number of different ways: a polygon, a
Bézier spline, etc.  One particularly interesting way, to me, is as a
tilewise polynomial.</p>
<p>Suppose you have divided your screen up into tiles of 256×256 pixels.
The screen I'm looking at at the moment is 1024×600, so it would need
four such tiles horizontally and three vertically, for a total of
twelve.  But coordinates within each tile are only 8 bits per
coordinate, which means that you can do parallel computations over 16
tiles using SSE instructions.</p>
<p>Suppose you decide to represent the shape's border within a given tile
as a polynomial, either for the horizontal axis in terms of the
vertical or vice versa, along with limits.  What degree of polynomial
do you need?</p>
<p>Clearly if the shape border is of arbitrary complexity you need a
degree-256 polynomial.  But if you just want to hit three points in
the tile, you only need a degree-2 polynomial.  And if you need two
points with specific derivatives — say, the top and bottom of the tile
— you can do that with a degree-3 polynomial.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
