(5 minutes)</div><p>How much speech would you need to sample to make a diphone synthesis
engine out of it?</p>
<p>How many diphones are there in English?  The following set of words
more or less covers the phoneme set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ack, ache, mother, father, bet, cite, done, leash, gum, hedge, sip,
  rot, sought, room, foot, azote, few, valley, which, yet, think,
  pleasure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>espeak --ipa</code> renders this as follows:</p>
<pre><code> ˈak
 ˈeɪk
 mˈʌðə
 fˈɑːðə
 bˈɛt
 sˈaɪt
 dˈʌn
 lˈiːʃ
 ɡˈʌm
 hˈɛdʒ
 sˈɪp
 ɹˈɒt
 sˈɔːt
 ɹˈuːm
 fˈʊt
 ˈazəʊt
 fjˈuː
 vˈalɪ
 wˈɪtʃ
 jˈɛt
 θˈɪŋk
 plˈɛʒə
</code></pre>
<p>To this we need to add at least æ, which I'm not sure how to do with
espeak without -v en-us.</p>
<p>This reduces to this set of phonemes, as I understand them:</p>
<pre><code>ʌ
ɑː
a
aɪ
æ
b
d
ð
dʒ
ʒ
eɪ
ə
əʊ
f
h
iː
j
uː
k
l
m
n
ɔː
p
s
t
tʃ
ʃ
uː
ʊ
v
w
z
θ
</code></pre>
<p>That's 34 phonemes.  That means that English can't have more than 34²
= 1156 diphones, although in practice English phonotactics exclude
most of these.</p>
<p>English speech is typically on the order of 200 wpm, and each word
might average 5 phonemes, so this is about 1000 phonemes (and thus 999
diphones) per minute of speech, which is to say that you could in
theory capture all the English diphones from roughly one
carefully-constructed minute of speech.  If instead the diphones are
uniformly randomly distributed, the number of uncovered diphones will
drop by a factor of 2.7195 (about <em>e</em>) per 1156 phonemes uttered, an
exponential progression 1156, 425.1, 156.3, 57.5, 21.1, 7.8, 2.9, 1.1,
0.39, 0.14, so complete coverage would usually require some 7 or 8
minutes of recorded speech.</p>
<p>But in fact some phonemes and thus some diphones are much less
frequent than average: the order is very crudely something like,
first, n, ə, d, and t; a factor of 2 lower, a, f, z, s, m, l, and iː;
a factor of two lower, v, p, k, ð, w, uː, j, b, and ɔː; and so on.  A
standard Zipfian guess is that the 34th phoneme is about 3% as common
as the most frequent one.  This would tend to lengthen the time
required for complete coverage, just as phonotactic restrictions would
tend to shorten it.</p>
<p>Crudely, though, I think it's reasonable to guess that sampling a few
minutes of speech should be enough to produce a comprehensible
approximation of a person's speech, without requiring previous
knowledge like statistics of other people's speech in the language.</p>
<p>An interesting question is how to formulate a prepared speech that you
could read in a minute or so that would provide a richer-than-average
set of diphones.  Given, say, the pronunciation of each word in
/usr/share/dict/words, you can formulate this as a combinatorial
optimization problem: the shortest set of words containing all the
diphones contained in all the words.  Analyzing a recording of such a
prepared speech would be easier than analyzing arbitrary speech
because the alignment problem would be much easier.</p>
<p>As a quick experiment, I recorded myself reading the above list of 22
words, about 72 phonemes, slowly, in 21 seconds, under relatively poor
recording conditions, with <code>rec words.wav</code>.  Then I encoded it with
LPC-10 with <code>sox words.wav words.lpc10</code>.  The resulting LPC-10 file
was 6447 bytes (293 bytes per word, 90 bytes per phoneme) and was
pretty comprehensible; it would surely contain enough information for
phoneme alignment.</p>
<h2>How exactly do phoneme alignment?</h2>
<p>Maybe the matrix profile would help, for example, over a time series
of mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) vectors, for example, or
of LPC coefficient vectors.  Maybe for a sufficiently small dataset
the whole correlation matrix that the matrix profile is a "profile" of
would be more useful; the peaks in that correlation matrix might tell
you at which time points the same phoneme occurred previously and
later, which you could compare against the temporal distribution
patterns of phonemes in the supposed phoneme sequence.</p>
<p>Maybe you could use something like the Viterbi algorithm, in which the
"symbols being transmitted" are positions in the supposed phoneme
sequence rather than phonemes, each with a transition to itself (that
is, the phoneme continued from one time window to the next) and to the
following phoneme in the sequence --- although this requires some a
priori knowledge of what each phoneme sounds like.  But once you have
even the most basic guess about alignment, you can use that to get an
improved guess about what each phoneme sounds like, then repeat the
procedure.</p>
<p>This is surely a problem that is well explored in the research
literature.</p>
<p>An interesting possibility is to try to use some kind of
self-organizing maps to map the space of observed sounds, perhaps
using three or four dimensions conjectured to correspond to tongue
position and nasality; the idea is that the continuous changes in
sound harmonic content provide you with information about which sounds
are physically adjacent to which other sounds.  (Voice pitch and
sibilance are probably independent dimensions there.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/audio.html">Audio</a> (40 notes)
