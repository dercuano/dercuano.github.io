(9 minutes)</div><p>I remember when I was a kid I used to love playing Joe Power’s
“Wizard’s Castle” game, which is about 900 lines and, as I learned
today, originally ran on the 16-kilobyte model of the Exidy Sorcerer
home computer at the New Directions in Computing computer store, after
which the Kingdom of N’Dic is named.</p>
<p>When I was a kid I tried to understand the source code of the game,
since after all it is only 900 lines, written in a programming
language I was pretty familiar with, and performed a function I was
pretty familiar with, having spent hundreds, if not thousands, of
hours playing the game.  Unfortunately, I didn’t know what I was
looking for.</p>
<p>I just downloaded the IPCO version of the the game from
myabandonware.com and find that it’s still somewhat hard to understand
the source.  Unfortunately this version is broken, or rather
cheated — the map is revealed starting from the beginning of the game.
So I needed to fix the bug, which turned out to be that line 4150
said:</p>
<pre><code>4150 IF Q &gt; 99 THEN Q=Q-100 ' LET Q=34 TO HIDE ROOMS
</code></pre>
<p>when it should say:</p>
<pre><code>4150 IF Q &gt; 99 THEN Q=34 ' LET Q=34 TO HIDE ROOMS
</code></pre>
<p>It also has a bug on line 3590, which says:</p>
<pre><code>3590 PRINT CHR$(27);"E"
</code></pre>
<p>This is the clear-screen sequence for the Heath H89 and H19, but this
version of the program is for GW-BASIC or BASICA; this line should
just say</p>
<pre><code>3590 CLS
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a sort of dictionary of the subroutines, goto targets, and
variables in the program.</p>
<p>A$: a temporary input variable.</p>
<p>Q: a temporary variable used in many places for many things.</p>
<p>R$: an array of the 4 player race names.
RC: the index of the player’s race.</p>
<p>SAMP$: a parameter indicating whether the program was invoked from
IPCO's SAMPLES.BAS program; if "YES" (due to being invoked as CHAIN
"WIZARD", 1010) then, upon exit, it reinvokes SAMPLES.BAS rather than
exiting to the BASIC prompt.</p>
<p>1000: program entry point</p>
<p>RF: a boolean indicating whether you have the Runestaff
OF: a boolean indicating whether you have the Orb of Zot</p>
<p>L: an array of 512 ints, representing the castle contents.  For
whatever reason (perhaps resulting from the conversion from the
Sorceror version which stored this array in character RAM), this is a
one-dimensional array with indices calculated by FND(Z) rather than a
three-dimensional array.  L entries have 100 added to them to mark
them as “unknown”.  Valid numbers range from 1–33 and 101–133, with 34
as a sort of special case representation of the whole 101–133 range
for the map.</p>
<p>The valid values are:</p>
<ol>
<li>. AN EMPTY ROOM</li>
<li>E THE ENTRANCE</li>
<li>U STAIRS GOING UP</li>
<li>D STAIRS GOING DOWN</li>
<li>P A POOL</li>
<li>C A CHEST</li>
<li>G GOLD PIECES</li>
<li>F FLARES</li>
<li>W A WARP</li>
<li>S A SINKHOLE</li>
<li>O A CRYSTAL ORB</li>
<li>B A BOOK</li>
<li>M A KOBOLD</li>
<li>M AN ORC</li>
<li>M A WOLF</li>
<li>M A GOBLIN</li>
<li>M AN OGRE</li>
<li>M A TROLL</li>
<li>M A BEAR</li>
<li>M A MINOTAUR</li>
<li>M A GARGOYLE</li>
<li>M A CHIMERA</li>
<li>M A BALROG</li>
<li>M A DRAGON</li>
<li>V A VENDOR</li>
<li>T THE RUBY RED</li>
<li>T THE NORN STONE</li>
<li>T THE PALE PEARL</li>
<li>T THE OPAL EYE</li>
<li>T THE GREEN GEM</li>
<li>T THE BLUE FLAME</li>
<li>T THE PALANTIR</li>
<li>T THE SILMARIL</li>
</ol>
<p>These are used to index into C$() and I$() mentioned below.</p>
<p>The two other special unique items (the Runestaff and the Orb of Zot)
do not have their own codes; the Runestaff is in the possession of a
monster (and is thus in the same room with it) while the Orb of Zot is
“disguised as” a warp, and in fact behaves as one.</p>
<p>C$(): an array of the 34 strings describing different room contents; the
34th is the dummy entry "X".</p>
<p>I$(): an array of the 34 characters to display different room contents
on the map.</p>
<p>9590–9620: a subroutine to pick a randomly chosen empty room and set
its contents to Q, returning its results in X, Y, and Z.</p>
<p>C: a 3×4 array of ints.  C(1,4), C(2,4), and C(3,4) are used to
represent whether the player is afflicted with particular curses, I
think — a leech that drains your gold, lethargy that makes you move
more slowly, and forgetfulness, which slowly erases your map.  These
curses are found in particular empty rooms.  This logic is in lines
2940–3050.</p>
<p>Lethargy apparently just makes you eat more often, but not eating
doesn’t harm you.  This has the feeling of an unfinished feature.
However, lethargy also gives monsters the initiative in combat.</p>
<p>H: the last time you ate.
T: The current time.</p>
<p>W$(): an array of weapon and armor names; NO WEAPON is index 1,
while NO ARMOR is index 5.</p>
<p>E$(): an array of 8 dishes one can cook from monsters.</p>
<p>WV: one less than the index of your current weapon in W$(), or 0 if
you are empty-handed.</p>
<p>AV: 5 less than the index of our current armor in W$(), or 0 if you
are empty-handed.
AH: your armor’s health or armor’s hit points; when this reaches 0,
the armor is destroyed.</p>
<p>LF: 1 if the player has a lamp, 0 otherwise.
FL: the number of flares the player has.
BL: 1 if the player is blind, 0 otherwise.
BF: 1 if the player has a book stuck to their hands, 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>T(): an array of 8 ints which are 1 if the player possesses the
corresponding treasure or 0 otherwise.  These are in the same order as
the numbers for the room contents; for valid indices, T(Q) represents
the possession of C$(Q+25).</p>
<p>O(): an array of 3 ints containing the coordinates of the Orb of Zot
R(): an array of 3 ints containing the coordinates of the Runestaff</p>
<p>O$: the returned user input from the subroutine at 9830 or other input
subroutines</p>
<p>FNA(Q): returns a random number in [1, Q]</p>
<p>FNB(Q): returns Q wrapped to the range [1, 8] (i.e. (Q-1) % 8 + 1),
which is what you want for wrapping coordinates to the 3×3×3
hypertorus structure of Zot’s castle</p>
<p>FNC(Q): returns Q if Q&lt;19, otherwise 18; used for saturating
arithmetic on character attribute values (strength ST, dexterity DX,
intelligence IQ), which cannot increase past 18.</p>
<p>FND(Z): returns the index into L at which to find the contents of
castle room (X, Y, Z).</p>
<p>FNE(Q): returns, roughly, Q % 100 — used to compute the true contents
of a possibly unmapped room.</p>
<p>X: an X-coordinate in the castle, normally that of the player (but
also an implicit argument to FND); saved in A when a temporary value
is needed</p>
<p>Y: a Y-coordinate in the castle, normally that of the player (but also
an implicit argument to FND); saved in B when a temporary value is
needed</p>
<p>Z: a Z-coordinate in the castle, normally that of the player; saved in
C when a temporary value is needed</p>
<p>A, B, C: used to save the player’s X, Y, and Z at times; also used in
one place temporarily for the coordinates of the Orb of Zot.  Also,
during combat, A is used to store the index of the monster type (12
less than its index into C$().)</p>
<p>VF: 1 if vendors are angry with you, 0 otherwise</p>
<p>Y$: a prompt string</p>
<p>NG: the number of games played so far, used to avoid reintroducing the
game</p>
<p>1–1200: initialization code for the whole program</p>
<p>1240–1390: initialization code for a new game (“restocking the castle”)</p>
<p>9770–9820: subroutine to print a line of asterisks</p>
<p>9830–9870: subroutine to request a generic one-letter choice from the
user in O$, with two entry points — the entry point at 9830 prints a
blank line and a prompt, while the entry point at 9850 does not.</p>
<p>2920–8410: the main game turn loop.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/history.html">History</a> (71 notes)
