(18 minutes)</div><p>I can whistle from about 600Hz up to about 1600Hz.  There is often
substantial unintentional amplitude modulation on my whistle around
25–100 Hz.  The vibrations can’t ramp up or down by 10dB in less than
about 8 cycles, even when I’m releasing a tongue stop, and more
typically take 20 or 30 cycles, suggesting a Q factor of somewhere
around 10–20.  Second, third, and fourth harmonics are detectable, but
weak; even the second harmonic is 52dB down from the fundamental.  I
can easily ramp up from 800Hz to 1600Hz in 1.3 seconds.  Doing the
same ramp in 100 milliseconds is feasible with more effort.</p>
<p>(Semitone resolution is a Q factor of about 17, so using a linear
filter with a lower Q factor would fuzz out frequency selectivity too
much to be useful.)</p>
<p>A particular 70-millisecond segment of low whistle had a frequency
peak at 615 Hz at -29.3 dB, falling off to -35.6 dB at 610 Hz and
-38 dB at 628 Hz.  This suggests a Q factor of around 60 during the
whistle itself.  (Maybe even a bit higher.)</p>
<p>This suggests that the “window size” I should be looking at to detect
a whistle could be up to about 20 or 30 cycles or milliseconds in
length, and I could band-pass filter the signal to a bandwidth of
about 1000 Hz as a first step.  Then I could measure the distance
between zero crossings or calculate some autocorrelations or
something, or run a PLL.</p>
<p>Using high frequencies like this reduces the signal detection latency.</p>
<h2>Efficiency questions</h2>
<p>I’d like to run this all on an Arduino.  So, to reduce the
computational cost of this, probably I should start by downsampling to
about 4–8ksps.  (The Arduino could perhaps capture natively at this
rate.)  Then, maybe I could resample to 2ksps with downconversion from
600Hz to baseband, but maybe that’s not a good idea — among other
things, it might increase latency.</p>
<p>There are a variety of possible things you can do from there.  You can
run a software PLL.  These can be quite simple and efficient; this one
does 7 simple operations per sample and sort of works to track my
voice frequency; you need a few more operations to detect presence or
absence:</p>
<pre><code>/* A PLL in one line of C. arecord | ./tinypll | aplay */
main(a,b){for(;;)putchar(b+=16+(a+=(b&amp;256?1:-1)*getchar()-a/512)/1024);}
</code></pre>
<p>You can do STFTs, but that’s never going to be fast.  (At least within
barely more than a single octave, you don’t have a terrible tradeoff
of window width; you can just use a window of about 30 ms).  You can
count zero-crossings, but that throws away most of the information in
the signal.  You can calculate the autocorrelation function for
particular frequencies of interest, or when multiplication is slow,
the sum of absolute differences.  Or you can use particle filters.</p>
<h3>Particle filters</h3>
<p>A simple particle-filter-based scheme could measure prediction error
of each sample based on various candidate lags, taking the last 20 or
30 cycles (or whatever) as the predictor.  If you used 32 cycles, you
could calculate the prediction like this:</p>
<pre><code>s16 total = 0
  , lag = p.lag  // 12.4 fixed-point
  , lagi = 0
  ;
for (u8 i = 0; i != 32; i++) {
    total += latest_x[(lagi += lag) &gt;&gt; 4];
}
return total &gt;&gt; 5;
</code></pre>
<p>But that is kind of shitty because you have to do shit 32 times: 64
16-bit additions, 33 4-of-16 bit shifts, 32 indexed byte fetches.
It’ll take hundreds of cycles to calculate the prediction for a single
particle.  (Also, you get some aliasing, because you’re effectively
resampling your signal with nearest-neighbor resampling.)</p>
<h4>Incremental prediction</h4>
<p>A better approach might be to incrementally update the totals.  I will
explain.</p>
<p>Suppose we’re at 8ksps and our range of frequencies of interest goes
from 700 to 1400 Hz.  Then each cycle is from 5.7 to 11.4 samples; 32
cycles are from 183 cycles to 370 samples.  A frequency in the middle
of the range like 1000 Hz will have a cycle every 8 samples.  So its
current prediction is almost the same as the prediction from 8 cycles
ago — it will be adding up almost the same samples.  If it cycles
through an array of 8 totals, it can update the current total by
subtracting the sample 32 cycles ago that fell off the end of the
window, then adding the sample from 1 cycle ago.  Then it can make the
prediction based on that.</p>
<p>The same kind of logic applies for cycles of exactly 7 samples
(1143 Hz), exactly 9 samples (889 Hz), exactly 6 samples (1333 Hz),
exactly 10 samples (800 Hz), and exactly 11 samples (727 Hz), although
some of these will need an array of more totals, up to 11, while
others will cycle through less.</p>
<p>Non-integer numbers of samples are trickier, since we don’t want to
count back by strides of 8.2 samples from the present — by the time we
get even 3 strides back, we’re no longer looking at the same sample
that we looked at the last time we were at this phase, so subtracting
the sample 32 strides back from the total makes no sense — it wasn’t
part of the total to begin with.  The solution that occurs to me is to
maintain in each phase, associated with the running total, two
accumulators like the variable <code>lag</code> in the above code, one for the
beginning of the window and one for its end.  So then the update code
for a single phase accumulator becomes something like this:</p>
<pre><code>return (p-&gt;total += x[(p-&gt;head += p-&gt;lag) &gt;&gt; 4 &amp; xmask]
                  - x[(p-&gt;tail += p-&gt;lag) &gt;&gt; 4 &amp; xmask]) &gt;&gt; 5;
</code></pre>
<p>This is 9 operations per particle update instead of hundreds.
However, it omits the logic to select the proper phase, which I think
sometimes needs to update two phases.</p>
<p>4 bits of fractional sample allows resolving between lags of
8 samples, 8.0625 samples, and 7.9375 samples — 1000 Hz, 992.2 Hz, and
1007.9 Hz, respectively.  This is excessive precision for 32
cycles.  We probably can’t do better than about half a cycle during
our window of frequency precision, which is to say 4 samples out of
256, which means that we really only need 3 bits.</p>
<p>An alternative that avoids the need to track the tail is just to
exponentially decay the totals, maybe in a cascade of two or three;
that’s what the PLL given above does.</p>
<h3>Sinusoidal phase detection for PLLs</h3>
<p>If you change the particle-filter approach to try to follow the signal
by modifying the period of a particle, rather than by spawning new
particles with slightly different periods, you end up with a PLL.  A
simple thing to do would be to look at the prediction error and
compare it to the derivative.  If the prediction error is of the same
sign as the derivative (of either the signal or the prediction),
you’re falling behind the signal and need to speed up.  If it’s of the
opposite sign, you’re getting ahead of the signal and need to slow
down.  And the prediction error from the phase error will be
proportional to the derivative, which has two contradictory
implications:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the derivative is large, you should expect a large prediction
   error from a small phase shift, so you should consider prediction
   errors less important.</li>
<li>When the derivative is large, the prediction error is less likely
   to be due to noise and more likely to be due to an actual phase
   shift, so you should consider prediction errors more important.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think #2 wins out.</p>
<p>I think all of this will only really work right if your waveform is
pretty simple, though, like somewhere in between a triangle, square,
sawtooth, and sine wave.  Waveforms with weird shapes with negative
local maxima and positive local minima will cause trouble.
Fortunately, we’re kind of filtering those out anyway in this case,
and my whistles are 99.75% sinusoidal, as I said at the beginning,
even without bandpass filtering.</p>
<p>So it might make sense to just run a sinusoidal oscillator instead of
using an average of previous samples as the prediction.  (But maybe
using previous samples is cheaper.)</p>
<h3>A simpler PLL phase detector supporting weird waveforms</h3>
<p>Suppose we have an estimated waveform which is the average of the last
few cycles (say, a simple moving average of 16 cycles), and we want to
know if we’re early or late on the phase.  Well, we can subtract the
sample xᵢ from the estimate at this point in the waveform eᵢ and get
an estimation error: eᵢ - xᵢ.  Suppose it’s positive.  Does that mean
we’re early or late?  It depends on the average derivative over the
relevant timspan.  But what is the relevant timespan?  It depends on
how big the error is; if the error is small, it’s short, and if the
error is large, it’s long.</p>
<p>It would be relatively straightforward to average derivatives over
different spans: for example, (e[i + 4] - e[i - 4]) &gt;&gt; 3, and (e[i+8]
- e[i-8]) &gt;&gt; 4, and so on.  But perhaps a simpler solution, given that
we have a whole estimated waveform, is to look forward and backward in
time for the next and previous place the curve crosses xᵢ.  Once we
find it, it directly gives us a phase error estimate for that sample.
We could get more elaborate and guess how reliable that estimate is,
based on how steep the slope is at that point and how many other
nearby crossings there are, and indeed we could even compute a whole
probability distribution for the phase error and use it to update our
prior probability distribution, but it’s probably adequate to just use
some kind of moving average or median of the phase-error estimates.</p>
<h3>Transfer oscillator</h3>
<p>An approach sometimes used in analog electronics to precisely measure
unreasonably high frequencies is the “transfer oscillator technique”,
in which “you phase-lock the nth harmonic of a VCO to the input
signal, then measure the VCO frequency and multiply the result by n,”
according to Horowitz &amp; Hill.  It seems like you could also do
something like this in the digital realm.  Suppose you’re trying to
detect a whistle in the 600–1600Hz range, and you have a candidate
frequency, say 1400Hz.  You can do a phase detection every <em>four
cycles</em>, which is to say at 350Hz (every 2.86 milliseconds) to see
which way you’re slipping out of phase.  This could reasonably be done
with a modern low-power fast-wakeup microcontroller that goes to sleep
in the middle.</p>
<p>It seems like this approach may have some big drawbacks, though.  One
is that, with the Q factor of 10–20 of my mouth’s whistle, you are
going to have a really hard time detecting short whistles this way.</p>
<h2>Flying saucer sounds</h2>
<p>Amplitude-modulated whistles (by vocalizing with the larynx while
whistling) are something else entirely; they have the strongest peak
at the whistle frequency, but in one signal I looked at, the sum and
difference components were only about 10dB weaker, while being 20dB
stronger than the valley in between.  And the sum and difference
components for the second harmonic of the vocal sound, while another
20–30 dB weaker than the upconverted first harmonic, were still
10–20 dB stronger than the valleys in between.  The frequencies in
this case were 1349, 1476, 1604, 1732, and 1866 Hz, with spacings of
127, 128, 128, and 134 Hz, respectively.  The most striking feature,
though, is that these inharmonic overtones moved together with the
whistle when it changed frequency.</p>
<p>I did try changing my larynx frequency without changing the whistle
frequency, but I wasn’t successful.</p>
<hr />
<p>An amusing note: if I could whistle more consistently, with a Q of,
say, 60, I could undersample the signal in such a way as to alias the
notes down into a much smaller bandwidth than the 1000Hz they occupy
now.  Each note would only need 40Hz or so, so all 17 would probably
fit in a bit under 700 Hz, requiring just 1500 samples per second.
(Because they’re not linearly spaced, there’s some wasted spectral
space.)  There are a couple of downsides of this: first, a whistle
that goes slightly astray from its pitch would be detected as a
different note, more or less at random; second, the required Q of 60
also applies to the filtering, and I think it might impose a really
large latency; third, you need to bandlimit the signal to just the
whistle band, and broadband noise within the whistle band will be
impossible to remove.</p>
<h2>Musical notes</h2>
<p>In A440 12-tone equal temperament, the notes in the 600–1600Hz range are:</p>
<ul>
<li>622.25 Hz</li>
<li>659.26 Hz</li>
<li>698.46 Hz</li>
<li>739.99 Hz</li>
<li>783.99 Hz</li>
<li>830.61 Hz</li>
<li>880.00 Hz</li>
<li>932.33 Hz</li>
<li>987.77 Hz</li>
<li>1046.50 Hz</li>
<li>1108.73 Hz</li>
<li>1174.66 Hz</li>
<li>1244.51 Hz</li>
<li>1318.51 Hz</li>
<li>1396.91 Hz</li>
<li>1479.98 Hz</li>
<li>1567.98 Hz</li>
</ul>
<p>A quick whistle test in front of my laptop with Audacity had me
whistling a short melody (from the Myrath song “Endure the Silence”)
at 1130Hz, 1137Hz, 1235Hz, 1127Hz, 1103/1072/1075 Hz, 1072Hz, 973Hz,
898Hz, 849Hz, 752Hz, 728Hz, and 781Hz, which is about as far from A440
as it’s possible to get.  As the 1103/1072/1075 indicates, the
spectral peak frequencies reported by Audacity are perhaps somewhat
noisy.  In 12-TET semitones relative to the frequency of the first
note, this is 0.00, 0.11, 1.54, -0.05, -0.86, -0.91, -2.59, -3.98,
-4.95, -7.05, -7.61, -6.40.  While it’s possible I’m 46 cents out of
tune on some of the notes, I suspect that another reasonable
hypothesis is that Myrath is using 24-TET.</p>
<p>Are these frequencies really that unreliable?  Upon examining the
(last) 1072Hz note again, it appears as 1077Hz, or -0.83 semitones
from the first note, so Audacity’s noise in that case amounted to 3
cents.  Upon further examination, 33 cycles in the middle of it lasted
1352 samples (at 44.1 ksps), zero-crossing to zero-crossing, or 30.658
ms, giving the frequency there as 1076 Hz.  20 cycles at a later point
in the same note lasted 809 samples, giving a frequency of 1090 Hz
there.  962 samples earlier on in the note contained 24 cycles, giving
a frequency of 1100 Hz.  So actually they are pretty reliable.</p>
<p>After applying a gentle 12dB/octave rolloff below 600Hz and 1600Hz,
the vast majority of the signal power was in the whistle; it was
typically 30dB louder than anything else, despite the major traffic
noise.  Second and third harmonics were still visible.</p>
<h3>How’s my rhythm?</h3>
<p>I was tonguing the notes to get very definite start times.</p>
<p>The time interval from the start of the first note to the start of the
second was 21167 samples.  From the second to the third was 21746;
from the third to the fourth was 21312; from the fourth to the fifth
was 21505; from the fifth to the sixth was 25652; from the sixth to
the seventh was 11139; from the seventh to the eighth was 10752; from
the eighth to the ninth was about 10728, though it’s fuzzy; from the
ninth to the tenth was 10873; from the tenth to the eleventh was
10536; and from the eleventh to the twelfth and last was 11210.  If we
take our nominal quarter-note time as 21505 samples, which is the
median of [21167, 21746, 21505] and 2*[11139, 10752, 10728, 10873,
10536, 11210], then the errors here are -1.6%, +1.1%, 0, +3.6%, -.05%,
-0.23%, +1.1%, -2.0%, and +4.3%, except that 25652 is 1.193 beat
times, which is a pretty weird number.  The other errors might be just
as much from the mouse selection skillz I’m using in Audacity to mark
the time intervals as from actually being off the beat.</p>
<p>The notes mostly each ended a bit before the succeeding note, but I
think there was a significant amount of room echo.</p>
<p>The great thing about this is that it provides <em>plenty</em> of margin of
error for identifying beat timings.  If the standard deviation of
being on-beat is ±2.0%, as it is in this case, then we can be pretty
confident in identifying which beat a note is starting on.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/dsp.html">Digital signal processing (DSP)</a> (60 notes)
