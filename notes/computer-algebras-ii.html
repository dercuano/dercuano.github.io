(23 minutes)</div><p>Typical computers support three algebras directly: GF(2ⁿ) (integer
math), GF(2)ⁿ (bitwise operations), and floating-point math, which is
its own weird thing.  Combining operations from more than one of these
algebras often gives surprisingly fast iteration-free code to solve
problems that would seem to require iteration, like clearing the
rightmost bit set in a word: <code>x &amp; x - 1</code>.  However, other operations
that aren’t inherently computationally expensive are still expensive
with these operations — the classic example is the fixed bit
permutation at the input and output of DES, which is frequently
speculated to be nothing more than an attempt to artificially slow
down software implementations.</p>
<p>With the advent of the dark-silicon age, where we can fabricate far
more transistors on a chip than we can afford to remove the heat from
at reasonable clock speeds, it seems that adding new instructions that
are less mainstream in their applications should be worthwhile.  So
far, this has mostly taken the form of instructions to implement
particular cryptographic algorithms (like AES-NI) and
multimedia-oriented and 3-D-oriented instructions like those in
3DNow!, MMX, various versions of SSE, AltiVec, and modern GPUs.  These
have the advantage of adding various kinds of vector algebras.</p>
<p>(SSE 4.2 also added a CRC32 instruction.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the available instructions in the multimedia and 3-D
sets are generally fairly incoherent, making them awkward to program
with.</p>
<p>We could add more random instructions that compute functions like
“⌈√(x³ - 50x + y)⌉ over the integers”, but this would be kind of a
waste of time — they can already be evaluated on mainstream hardware
without unreasonable overhead on top of their inherent computational
cost; and they don’t compose in a useful way — which is to say, they
don’t form an interesting algebra.  Or we could add an instruction
that computes the derivative of a closed-form symbolic expression, but
because the set of closed-form symbolic expressions is infinite, you
can’t fit a symbolic expression into a fixed-size register — only
<em>finite</em> algebras are of interest.</p>
<p>So, what other finite algebras might it be advantageous to add
hardware support for because mainstream hardware currently imposes
punishing overhead on them?</p>
<h2>Things we already pretty much have</h2>
<p>We might consider lattices of finite set containment, but in fact the
bitwise operations already give us that.  Many other interesting
lattices are already provided by the vector-math stuff we added for
3-D rendering.</p>
<p>Similarly, both signed and unsigned integer math are already
reasonably well supported by the GF(2ⁿ) operations thath have been in
CPUs for decades.</p>
<p>Bitwise rotation instructions have been totally mainstream for decades
(since at least the 4004); I was always mystified by these, but it
turns out they’re necessary for multi-precision bit-shift operations,
and they’re also handy for individually testing bits that you’re
shifting out of numbers.</p>
<p>We also got saturating arithmetic as part of the whole multimedia and
vector instruction shit sandwich.</p>
<p>Linear feedback shift registers seem like they would be a pain, since
in theory the next bit to shift into the register is the XOR of the
tapped bits from the register.  But in fact you can also implement an
LFSR by shifting a bit <em>out</em> of the register and using it to
conditionally XOR <em>all</em> of the tapped bits <em>into</em> the register.</p>
<h2>Shuffling, permutation, symmetric groups, and substitution ciphers</h2>
<p>Much of this section concerns, in one or another sense, the symmetric
group on some small number of elements, typically somewhere between 16
and 256 elements.  This may seem like a strangely arbitrary choice,
but in fact the symmetric group on N elements is in some sense the
canonical group on N elements — every other group on N elements is a
subgroup of it!  So, in a sense, operations that can handle arbitrary
symmetric groups can handle arbitrary groups.</p>
<p>Computers are, at their core, code machines; they operate on arbitrary
information enciphered into a representation they can deal with.
Classical (pre-computer) ciphers were broadly classified into
substitution and transposition ciphers.  In substitution ciphers, the
pieces of the plaintext tell where to put pieces of the key schedule
to form the ciphertext; in transposition ciphers, the pieces of the
key schedule where to put pieces of the plaintext to form the
ciphertext.  These are in a sense the same operation, and it is
somewhat surprising that they are so poorly supported in modern
hardware.  Perhaps this is accounted for by the fact that they are
very well supported indeed by RAM (and the 8086 has an XLAT
instruction that uses RAM for this in 11 clock cycles); it’s just that
RAM is falling progressively further and further behind the
capabilities of CPUs.</p>
<p><a href="http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/doc/instructions-en.html">Knuth’s MMIX has</a> instructions called MOR and MXOR, which “regard
the 8 bytes of a register as a 8×8-Matrix and compute the result as a
matrix multiplication”, or “set eacy byte of $X by looking at the
corresponding byte of $Z and using its bits to select bytes of $Y”
(Knuth’s Fascicle 1).  In effect, each bit specifies whether or not to
include one of the 8 input bytes in the computation of one of the 8
output bytes.  If only one bit is set in each byte of the second
argument, the output is just a rearrangement or shuffle of the input
bytes; but, by setting more bits, we can activate the OR or XOR
mentioned in the name.</p>
<p>Being generalized matrix multiplications using associative operators,
these operations are of course associative.  I know of no manufactured
CPU that implements them, but something similar is commonplace in FPGA
routing — the bits in $Z amount to a crossbar switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8052/7e7595530951081494d1b98f3f13da3033a2.pdf">As Mytkowicz, Musuvathi, and Schulte showed in their 2014 paper</a>,
the shuffle instructions such as PSHUFB in SSE3 and SSE4.2 can be used
to accelerate and parallelize finite-state-machine execution.  <a href="http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/PSHUFB.html">The
PSHUFB instruction</a> (<code>_mm_shuffle_epi8</code>) and its variant VPSHUFB is
something like a cut-down MOR, using indices encoded as binary
integers instead of bit vectors, thus offering no possibility of
combining multiple input bytes into one output byte, but it can
operate on 128-bit and 256-bit registers as well as 64-bit ones.
Still, because it applies a permutation to the input (which may be a
permutation) it’s associative too, which is how Mytkowicz et al. used
it to accelerate finite-state machines.</p>
<p>(More recent versions of SSE include PSHUFW and PSHUFD versions, which
shuffle wider chunks around.)</p>
<p>If what you wanted was specifically to compose permutations like that,
you’d be faced with a couple of problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Even a 256-bit VPSHUFB wastes 3 bits out of every index, in the
   sense that the maximum valid byte index is 31, so only the low 5
   bits of the index are used.  If you were to cut the indices to 6
   bits, you could fit 42 of them into a 256-bit register; if you
   could somehow use arithmetic coding, you could get the number a
   little higher still.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are times when you would like to compose permutations on sets
   of more than 32 or 42 elements, and it isn’t immediately obvious
   how to efficiently decompose such permutations on larger sets into
   permutations on smaller sets, although related questions have been
   explored in some depth in the context of building circuit-switched
   telephone systems out of crossbar switches.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another issue is that there are a number of kinds of bit permutation
that byte-shuffling (whether 8-bit or SIXBIT) doesn’t help you with.
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.29.4871">Massalin famously called for a perfect-bitwise-shuffle operation in
her dissertation</a>, which is still not available in current
hardware.</p>
<p>So here are a couple of new shuffling designs that might be worth
exploring:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 64-bit value v is considered to consist of 16 4-bit nybbles v<a href="http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/doc/instructions-en.html">0</a>
   through v[15].  xbar(a, b)[i] = a[b[i]], thus providing the same
   permutation-composition power as a 128-bit PSHUFB in half the bits.
   Additional nybble-perfect-shuffle operations “hi” and “lo” provide
   a way to combine nybbles from different registers without requiring
   fundamental operations of greater than binary arity: lo(a, b)[i] is
   a[(i-1)/2] when i is odd but b[i/2] when i is even, while
   hi(a, b)[i] is a[8 + (i-1)/2] when i is odd but b[8 + i/2] when i
   is even.</li>
</ol>
<p>These nybble-perfect-shuffle operations make it straightforward to
   use this 16-nybble-xbar instruction as a 16-byte xbar, a 16-wyde
   xbar, etc.; and they make it relatively straightforward to leverage
   them into computing permutations of larger groups of nybbles.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The N-bit value mux(x, y, z) is computed from three N-bit values x,
   y, and z as follows.  The bit mux(x, y, z)[i] is x[i] if z[i] is 1,
   otherwise y[i].  The N-bit value shuf(a, b) is computed from an
   N-bit value a and an N/2-bit value b as mux(a[0:N/2], a[N/2:N], b)
   || mux(a[0:N/2], a[N/2:N], ¬b) where <code>||</code> is string concatenation
   and ¬ is bitwise negation.  The N-bit value 2shuf(a, b) is computed
   from two N-bit values a and b as shuf(shuf(a, b[0:N/2]), b[N/2:N]).
   Arguments from sorting networks suggest that it’s possible to
   perform any permutation of N bits by providing the appropriate <code>b</code>
   values to (lg N)(lg N + 1)/4 2shuf operations; when N is 128, for
   example, 14 2shuf operations suffice, and when N is 1024, 28 2shuf
   operations suffice.  Arguments from <code>mux(x, y, z) = x &amp; z | y &amp; ~z</code>
   suggest that you can do this on existing hardware and don’t need
   new hardware.  XXX no this is totally wrong because the bits aren’t
   being perfect-shuffled!  I want a perfect shuffle!  rewrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MNAND or MNOR, which are analogous to the MOR and MXOR
   instructions, but permit specifications of a large class of
   small parallel computations as a fixed sequence of $Z values.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lerp</h2>
<p>As Darius Bacon pointed out, you can think of linear interpolation as
being a sort of generalization of C’s ternary operator.</p>
<p>GPUs automatically provide linear interpolation between texels.
Iterating linear interpolation provides Bézier curves.  Alpha-blending
linearly interpolates between pixel values.  The usual way to do
linear interpolation is with two separate multiplications and a
subtraction:</p>
<pre><code>x := 1.0 - y;
z := y · a;
z += x · b;
</code></pre>
<p>However, this uses slightly more than twice as many bit operations as
necessary; you can adapt the standard binary long multiplication
algorithm to lerp instead.  The standard algorithm to add the product
y · b to z, consuming both, is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to step 4.</li>
<li>If y is odd (that is to say, if <code>y &amp; 1</code> is nonzero), z += b.</li>
<li>y ← ⌊y/2⌋; concurrently, b ← b · 2.</li>
<li>If y is nonzero, go to step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>While implementations of multiplication on transistor-starved hardware
of the distant past often used this algorithm literally, taking more
time to multiply by a larger multiplicand or one with more 1
bits — the 8086 would take anywhere from 128 to 154 clock cycles for a
16×16-bit multiply, while the 80486 would take 13 to 26 — modern
hardware instead unrolls the loop into a cascade of carry-save adders.
To multiply two 16-bit integers, for example, it has 256 carry-save
adders.  This means the loop gets rewritten as follows for a 16-bit
multiply:</p>
<p>Repeat 16 times:</p>
<ol>
<li>If y is odd, z += b.</li>
<li>y ← ⌊y/2⌋; b ← b · 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>The modification to make this algorithm interpolate linearly between a
and b is very simple:</p>
<p>Repeat 16 times:</p>
<ol>
<li>z += (b if y is odd else a).</li>
<li>y ← ⌊y/2⌋; b ← b · 2; a ← a · 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is easiest to understand if we think of a, b, and y as initially
representing 16-bit fractions between 0 and 1, with 1 being
represented by 16 1 bits, and the 32-bit result as likewise
representing a fraction between 0 and 1, but with 1 being represented
by 15 1 bits followed by 6 0 bits followed by as 1, which is
admittedly a somewhat awkward representation.  You can restore it to a
proper 16-bit form, if lerping is what you want, by taking the
leftmost 16 bits and adding their most significant bit to their least
significant bit.</p>
<p>So, for example, the 13-instruction multiplication code example on
p.54 of the 8080 Programmer’s Manual would become 15 instructions, and
would execute 11 or 12 instructions per iteration instead of 10 or 11.</p>
<p>(Most current hardware multipliers reportedly use Booth’s
multiplication algorithm, which is not quite as easy to adapt.)</p>
<p>Of course, you can replace “16” and “32” in the above with “N” and “2N”.</p>
<h2>Decimal arithmetic</h2>
<p>In the 1950s and into the 1960s, business computers invariably used
(binary-coded) decimal arithmetic, thus avoiding the need to
laboriously convert numbers from binary into decimal for output using
a long, slow series of divisions by 10.  The IBM Type 650 was a
typical example of this class; a random memory access on it took
2.5 ms, and it typically ran about 1000 instructions per second, but
needed 16.9 ms for a division, so converting a single six-digit number
from binary to decimal for output would have required a full tenth of
a second — much longer than was required to punch it into a card.</p>
<p>As computers got faster, conversion to decimal ceased to be the
computational bottleneck, and IBM moved its decimal-computer customers
over to the binary System/360, but included instructions in the 360
instruction set for operating on binary-coded decimal numbers as well,
stuffed two digits per byte, but only in memory (not in registers).</p>
<p>The primary instruction set we use today, AMD64, is derived ultimately
from the instruction set of a 1971 Japanese pocket calculator, whose
4004 CPU was developed by Intel.  The 4004 had a DAA instruction,
“Decimal Adjust Accumulator”, used to convert the result of a 4-bit
binary arithmetic operation into a 4-bit BCD result; <a href="http://www.intel.com/Assets/PDF/Manual/msc4.pdf">Intel’s manual
explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The accumulator is incremented by 6 if either the carry/link is 1 or
if the accumulator content is greater than 9.  The carry/link is set
to 1 if the result generates a carry, otherwise it is unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of this instruction is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1971: DAA is introduced with the opcode FB₁₆ in the 4004, which,
  though dozens of times faster than the IBM 650, still would have
  suffered performance problems from having to do a series of
  divisions in order to update the calculator display.</li>
<li>1972: dropped in the 8008, which was a more powerful follow-on to
  the 4004 but with fatal flaws in its instruction set design.  The
  8008, with its 8 8-bit registers, has its opcodes divided into octal
  fields.  The opcode space previously occupied by DAA and many other
  4004 instructions, <code>37*₈</code>, is now dedicated to instructions that store
  registers into memory.  All eight opcodes of <code>0*7₈</code>, one of which will
  be DAA on the 8080, are RET.</li>
<li>1974: DAA is reintroduced in an 8-bit version in the 8080, with the
  opcode 27₁₆ (047₈), which had the same registers as the 8008 but was
  an actually usable CPU.  It didn’t have multiply and divide
  instructions, but its stack was in RAM.  Its opcodes are divided
  into the same bitfields as the 8008’s.  Like the 8008, it has 8
  opcodes dedicated to subroutine returns, but now they’re <code>3*0₈</code> and
  are different conditional returns; maybe that was planned for the
  8008 but had to be cut.  Unconditional RET is a ninth return
  instruction, 311₈.</li>
<li>1978: renamed “decimal adjust for addition” in the 8086, and
  accompanied by DAS, AAA, AAD, and AAM instructions that do related
  things — the AAD and AAM instructions were added to enable decimal
  arithmetic with the new multiply and divide instructions.  The 8086
  had 16-bit registers instead of the 8-bit registers on the 8080, but
  DAA and friends still only work on 8 or even 4 bits of data.  I’m
  not sure what to make of this — they added four new instructions to
  support decimal arithmetic, but then didn’t bother to take advantage
  of the double-sized accumulator register?  The 8086 isn’t
  binary-compatible with the 8080, but DAA retains the same opcode,
  27₁₆.  There are four RETs: C2₁₆, C3₁₆, CA₁₆, and CB₁₆, none of
  which is the 311₈ from the 8080, which is unassigned on the 8086;
  it’s later reassigned to the fairly useless LEAVE on the 80188 and
  80186 in 1982.</li>
<li>1985: the entire group of instructions is preserved unchanged in the
  i386, which expanded the registers to 32 bits.  At this point it’s
  clearly only being preserved for backwards-compatibility — doing
  multi-precision arithmetic with it involves using almost an order of
  magnitude more instructions than doing the arithmetic in binary.
  This is the first of these updates that’s binary-backward-
  compatible — the 8086 was more or less compatible with the 8080 at
  the assembly level, but you couldn’t run unmodified 8080 binaries on
  it.  The i386 has a variety of processor modes to enable this
  backward compatibility.</li>
<li>2003: AMD introduces the 64-bit Opteron, which expands the registers
  to 64 bits, and adds a mode bit so it can continue executing
  unmodified 32-bit code.  In 32-bit mode, DAA and friends work as
  always; in 64-bit mode, they generate an invalid-opcode exception.
  Intel was trying to escape from backward compatibility with such
  nonsense with the Itanium, playfully dubbed “Itanic”, because of how
  it sank.  Intel followed AMD’s lead in 2004.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, today, if you have some decimal numbers, such as “321.23”,
“289.528”, “9076”, and “8”, and you want to do some arithmetic on them
on a computer, you have a few different options.  You can go through a
series of multiplications to convert them to binary floating-point and
then do arithmetic on them in binary, accepting the inevitable
rounding errors on numbers like “0.1”; you can pick a prescale, like
100, and convert them to binary integers instead (for example, "8"
becomes 800, and "321.23" becomes 32123) and then do arithmetic on
those; or you can use a software implementation of decimal math like
the Python <code>decimal</code> module.</p>
<p>(The computationally expensive part, actually, is not converting from
decimal to binary on binary hardware; that’s only a series of
multiplications, which are fast.  It’s converting back the other way,
which is a series of divisions, which are slow.</p>

<h2>Polynomials over GF(2)ⁿ</h2>
<p>Computing properties of LFSRs and CRCs require doing computations with
polynomials over GF(2)ⁿ.  Addition and subtraction of these
polynomials are just XOR, but multiplication and division are more
complicated operations.</p>
<p>SSE4.2 added a CRC32 instruction which performs an XOR and a
polynomial division by the polynomial 11EDC6F41₁₆, the CRC32C
polynomial; it runs a bit over twice as fast as a software
implementation, which makes me think that hopefully better alternative
uses for the silicon are available.  As far as I can tell, though, you
can’t use the SSE4.2 instruction to, for example, do Rabin-Karp string
search or rsync sliding-window duplicate probing.</p>
<h2>Arithmetic Coding</h2>
<p>???</p>
<h2>Cellular Automata</h2>
<p>The Cytocomputer was some custom silicon designed in the 1970s at ERIM
for some machine-vision applications; essentially it was a pipelined
two-dimensional cellular automaton which processed one pixel (or cell)
each clock cycle, with one line plus two pixels of latency per
pipeline stage, using FIFO buffers.  Each generation of the cellular
automaton was run on a separate hardware stage of the pipeline, which
could therefore easily be programmed for a different transition rule.
Typical rules did things like dilation, erosion, and edge detection.</p>
<p>Cellular automata, especially those with a small number of states, are
just about the worst possible case for per-instruction overhead.</p>
<p>XXX...</p>
<h2>Lattices</h2>
<p>XXX</p>
<h2>Complex numbers</h2>
<p>Base -1+i, “proposed by S. Khmelnik in 1964 and Walter F. Penney in
1965,” allows us to represent the Gaussian integers as finite
bitstrings without needing sign bits.  The addition and multiplication
operations on these numbers form a commutative ring, indeed, a
Euclidean domain, so even division can be sensibly defined.  I am not
sure if there is a way to preserve these properties with a finite bit
length, the way ordinary unsigned binary arithmetic does with GF(2ⁿ).
The fourth power of the base is real ((-1+i)⁴ = -4) and so, in the
complex plane, bit shifts by multiples of four amount to scaling a 2-D
plane by a power of 4 with some number of half-turns.</p>
<p>Complex numbers can be used to represent geometrical points,
translation (by addition), and rotation with scaling (by
multiplication).</p>
<p>So it might be worthwhile to add hardware to implement the relevant
addition and multiplication algorithms for base -1+i.</p>
<h2>p-adic numbers</h2>
<p>p-adic numbers (for some prime p) form a field.  This gives Hehner and
Horspool’s “quote notation” for finitely representing rational numbers
with simple arithmetic algorithms, although that notation is not now
considered practical due to exponential size explosions on some common
cases.</p>
