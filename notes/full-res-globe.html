(1 minute)</div><p>Suppose you want to make a globe with outrageously high resolution.
Maybe you want to map every street in the world, or every car.  How
much space do you need?</p>
<p>The Earth is almost exactly 40 000 000 meters around (the small error
in this number is due to long-ago measurement mistakes), and to see
every street, you need no worse than, say, 15-meter resolution — which
you can get from, say, Landsat.  OpenStreetMap may be a more
interesting data source.</p>
<p>40 million divided by 15 gives you 2⅔ million pixels around your
globe.  If you're using a regular 600dpi laser printer, your globe is
370 feet in circumference, or 18 meters in radius, 36 in diameter.
Your globe will be about 14 stories tall.</p>
<p>To reduce that to a single story tall, you'd need to reduce the size
by 16×, to 9600dpi.  At this resolution, your pixels are only 2.6
microns wide: within the range of what you can see with a light
microscope, but not easily.</p>
<p>However, 9600dpi is somewhat difficult to achieve.  2400dpi is
supposedly achievable on high-end inkjet printers, and you might be
able to use photographic reduction processes to reduce them 4:1.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
