(8 minutes)</div><p>Looking at getting a SIP provider for international calls.  I am
somewhat impeded by not knowing anything about SIP and RTP, although I
have a SIP client on this phone.</p>
<p>An overview, as I understand it: SIP is the standard call setup
protocol for VoIP; RTP is the protocol used for the actual data.  The
company that hooks up VoIP calls to the PSTN (public switched
telephone network) is called a “SIP provider” or “ITSP” (“internet
telephony service provider”).  Much of the SIP business currently
comes from companies who want to hook up their PBXes to the PSTN.  A
“DID” (“Direct Inward Dial [number]”) is a non-toll-free incoming phone number.  An “ATA” is a
SIP-speaking device you can plug an analog phone into.</p>
<p>SIP phones can speak directly to each other over the internet as well.</p>
<h2>Notes on particular providers</h2>
<h3>voip.ms</h3>
<p>Voip.ms seems to be one of the default choices, and I think <a href="https://www.voip.ms/en/rates/united-states">it would
cost</a> US$1.50 per month for E911 service (though maybe that’s
optional?), US$0.85 to US$1.25 per month for an incoming phone number
(plus US$0.40 to set it up), and about US$0.01 per minute both inbound
and outbound, including to “toll-free” numbers.  You need a minimum of
US$15 prepaid to do incoming or outgoing calls, but you can sign up
for an account and use their voice call test thing without paying.
They offer <a href="https://www.voip.ms/en/features/overview">a broad spectrum of features</a>.</p>
<h3>SIPStation</h3>
<p><a href="https://sipstation.com/">SIPStation</a> offers service at US$24.99 a month for a monthly plan,
plus (?) US$1 per month plus US$0.024 per minute.</p>
<h3>Vitelity</h3>
<p>Vitelity apparently no longer allows new customers to sign up for VoIP
since <a href="https://www.vitelity.com/voyant-merge-vitelity-bettervoice-business-units/">merging with Voyant in February 2018</a>; they’re 100% focused
on the VoIP VAR market now.</p>
<p><a href="https://freeswitch.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2883868">The FreeSWITCH Wiki page has a lot of stuff about working around
problems</a>, which I take to mean that they were very popular, not
that they had a lot of problems.</p>
<h3>Google Voice</h3>
<p>Google Voice apparently does support SIP but will cut you off if they
detect you’re calling 1-800 numbers from a non-US IP address.  Added
to that is the constant menace that they may link your phone number to
your Google account, so a problem on one means losing the other.  Not
an option I’d ever consider.</p>
<h3>Flowroute</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flowroute.com/pricing-details/">Flowroute charges</a> US$1 for setup and US$1.25 per month, plus the
Federal Universal Service Fund charge (of some unknown amount?) plus
US$0.012 per minute inbound and US$0.0098 per minute outbound.  They
default to business accounts but also offer personal accounts.  They
have <a href="https://www.flowroute.com/voice/">technical details</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://freeswitch.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2883692">The FreeSWITCH Wiki page just offers some XML</a> from 2013.</p>
<h3>Vonage</h3>
<p>Vonage mostly doesn’t offer SIP, though <a href="https://freeswitch.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2883896">the FreeSWITCH Wiki page
explains that secretly they do through resellers.</a> Not an option.</p>
<h3>Bandwidth.com</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bandwidth.com/">Bandwidth.com focuses on “the biggest brands”</a> and has a free
trial.</p>
<p><a href="https://freeswitch.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2883631">The FreeSWITCH Wiki page explains how to make it work as of 2011</a>.</p>
<h2>Notes on particular pages</h2>
<p>The above is partly collated from the below.</p>
<p><a href="https://freeswitch.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2883894">Freeswitch.org has a list that is far too long to
consider</a>.
But the page for voip.ms, aka Swiftvox (last updated 2014) shares
chunks of XML to use to configure, I guess, FreeSWITCH, to work
properly with voip.ms.  Also implies voip.ms defaults to being
configured for “ata device, ip phone or soft phone”, which is what I
have, of course.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freepbx/comments/714y09/best_sip_trunk_providers/">A year ago, jhalstead was looking
at</a>
“FlowRoute, Vonage, voip.ms, nextiva, Sipstation”.  Someone else in
the thread suggested Telnyx; another person seconded the FlowRoute
recommendation, and cyberchaplain said, “I’ve personally used
Bandwidth, Level3, Flowroute, callwithus and voip.ms and can’t
complain about any of them really.”  Others mentioned Vitelity,
Touchtone Communications, and Spectrum/TWC, and a Nextiva employee
tried to persuade them to switch to hosted.  This suggests that, at
the time, FlowRoute and voip.ms were the popular options.  But this
thread is mostly oriented toward companies with PBXes.</p>
<p><a href="https://nerdvittles.com/?p=13031">An ad for Vitelity</a> used SIPStation
as their comparison competitor.  The ad seems to be directed at small
businesses like a “hardware store or restaurant” who want to get phone
service for on the order of US$3.99 a month (vs. US$100 with
SIPStation), but also those who want to “scale up to hundreds of
trunks”.  It also mentions SIPStation’s ability to spoof caller ID as
a benefit, allowing you to use SIPStation for outgoing calls while
receiving your incoming calls on a different number.  The main point
of the post seems to be that it’s good to pay by the minute rather
than by the phone line, and an addendum notes that eventually
SIPStation switched to charging by the minute too.  Another addendum
notes that Vitelity is now Voyant Communications and “has halted new
registrations for the time being”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.voipsupply.com/blog/voip-insider/six-biggest-benefits-of-the-sipstation-sip-trunks-by-sangoma/">An ad for
SIPStation</a>
from 2017 touts the benefits of their pricing; its example company is
paying US$499 a month for two locations with 10 lines, but by using
SIPStation’s “trunk groups” they can switch to just 15 lines an pay
only US$374.25 a month.  Pretty cheap if you're a company with
multiple offices and dozens of employees, I guess.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Service_Cost">voip.ms publishes their pricing
information</a> as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VOIP/comments/9qv86z/moving_to_voipms_need_a_little_directionhelp/">Seven months ago Blade_Fox moved from Vonage to
voip.ms</a>,
though they didn’t explain why, and wanted help getting SMS working.
Mizzlezz, in the comments, is using Bandwidth.com.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VOIP/comments/6tukqd/voip_recommendation/">Last year johndrwhosmith</a> was looking for recommendations for a
“hosted/cloud PBX”, saying they were thinking of Nextiva, and slayter
commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>do not use voip.ms unless you are experienced in VOIP or intending
for residential usage</strong>. They have failed to register as a telecom
in Canada and could even be shut down tomorrow with nothing to say
about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe I’m being too blasé but I don’t see that as a big problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VOIP/comments/301kdz/timing_of_change_from_comcast_to_voip/">Four years ago <code>pseud_o_nym</code></a> was going to “port” their phone
number from Comcast to ring.to, and RocketTech99 recommended looking
at voip.ms (though it was “not [their] favorite provider”, they “have
a very low entrance cost”.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VOIP/comments/56smdq/itsps_porting_issues/">Two years ago, jrdbm, a reseller of Bandwidth.com’s VoIP service,
asked for help with some porting problems</a>, and got recommended
FlowRoute.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VOIP/comments/7pz6uo/are_there_any_free_voip_apps_that_allow_you_to/">This thread from last year explains when Google Voice cuts you
off.</a> People are also recommending voip.ms and Callcentric in
there, but I think the Callcentric recommendation is from someone who
works at Callcentric.</p>
