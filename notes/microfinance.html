<blockquote>
<p>This vogue has translated into a flood of real dollars:
institutional and individual investments in microfinance more than
doubled between 2004 and 2006, to $4.4 billion, and the total
volume of loans made has risen to $25 billion, according to
Deutsche Bank. Unfortunately, it has also translated into a flood
of hype. There’s no doubt that microfinance does a tremendous
amount of good, yet there are also real limits to what it can
accomplish. Microloans make poor borrowers better off. But, on
their own, they often don’t do much to make poor countries
richer.</p>
<p>This isn’t because microloans don’t work; it’s because of how
they work. The idealized view of microfinance is that budding
entrepreneurs use the loans to start and grow businesses—expanding
operations, boosting inventory, and so on. The reality is more
complicated. Microloans are often used to “smooth consumption”
—tiding a borrower over in times of crisis. They’re also, as
Karol Boudreaux and Tyler Cowen point out in a recent paper, often
used for non-business expenses, such as a child’s education. It’
s less common to find them used to fund major business expansions
or to hire new employees. In part, this is because the loans can
be very small—frequently as little as fifty or a hundred
dollars—and generally come with very high interest rates, often
above thirty or forty per cent. But it’s also because most
microbusinesses aren’t looking to take on more workers. The vast
majority have only one paid employee: the owner. As the economist
Jonathan Morduch has put it, microfinance “rarely generates new
jobs for others.”</p>
<p>This matters, because businesses that can generate jobs for others
are the best hope of any country trying to put a serious dent in
its poverty rate. Sustained economic growth requires companies
that can make big investments—building a factory, say—and that can
exploit the economies of scale that make workers more productive
and, ultimately, richer. Microfinance evangelists sometimes make
it sound as if, in an ideal world, everyone would own his own
business. “All people are entrepreneurs,” Muhammad Yunus has
said. But in any successful economy most people aren’t
entrepreneurs—they make a living by working for someone else. Just
fourteen per cent of Americans, for instance, are running (or
trying to run) their own business. That percentage is much higher
in developing countries—in Peru, it’s almost forty per cent. That’
s not because Peruvians are more entrepreneurial. It’s because
they don’t have other options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surowiecki’s argument seems to have two parts: first, that the only
way to create jobs is to hire people, and second, that small
investments have a lower internal rate of return than larger
investments --- that is, they are more efficient uses of capital.</p>
<p>I think neither of these arguments is correct.  </p>
<p>As Coase pointed out decades ago, there isn’t a large distinction
between a service supplier and an employee; in either case, you pay
money and receive services.  If there are two people engaged in making
nails and five more engaged in carpentry using those nails, then if
five more people take up the trade of carpentry, there is work
available for two more nail-makers.  It doesn’t matter whether these
seven people work for the same firm, or whether they buy the nails on
the open market; the number of jobs created is just the same.
Similarly, economies of scale do not necessarily depend on all the
workers working for the same firm.</p>
<p>To put it another way, traditional companies create jobs by hiring
people; nanocorps create jobs by buying goods and services.</p>
<p>Coase also pointed out that there is some distinction; one arrangement
or the other might be more efficient, depending on the costs of
transacting in the market and the inefficiencies of large firms.
Perhaps the Peruvians are entrepreneurial because they have
particularly harsh pressures against large firms, for example due to
government corruption or organized crime.</p>
<p>On to the issue of “big investments”.</p>
<p>The number of jobs created is largely a function of the amount of
value produced by the capital investments in question, and so the
number of jobs created per dollar of credit is largely a function of
the IRR of those investments, modulo the effects of inequality in
distribution.  If US$1000 of investment increases workers’
productivity by US$1000 per year, it creates some number of jobs; but
that number is likely to be more or less the same whether it is
increasing 20 entrepreneurs’ income by US$50 per year each (some of
which they can spend on inputs such as cellphone minutes, electricity,
wool, or wood, creating jobs in those industries) or whether it is
increasing a factory’s income by US$1000 per year (in which case it
might do the same, or it might hire another worker or three).</p>
<p>The high (not to say usurious) interest rates of the microcredit loans
in question, coupled with their low default rates, are strong evidence
that the internal rate of return on these small investments is fairly
high.  Most of those loans are probably good choices for the people
who receive them, I believe, or microcredit would have a serious image
problem.  (Journalists love nothing more than unmasking hypocrisy.)</p>
<p>There is no principled reason to think that in general, large capital
investments will have high IRRs that are systematically unavailable to
small capital investments.  This kind of thing depends greatly on the
technology available.</p>
<p>There are probably some big investments that are worthwhile.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/economics.html">Economics</a> (33 notes)
