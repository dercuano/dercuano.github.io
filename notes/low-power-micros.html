<p>E-ink displays are capable of supporting continuous, comfortable
reading at average power levels under 3 milliwatts.  For this to be
useful, we need a microcontroller to drive them at comparable power.
But 5–20 watts might be available sometimes, and we’d like to be able
to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>To build a computer that provides rapid UI response on very low
average power (&lt;10mW, &gt;100 seconds per joule) I think you need, among
other things, multiple processors: a low-speed, low-power “peripheral
processor”, probably designed as an embedded microcontroller, for
normal real-time interaction, plus a higher-speed “central processor”
that powers up occasionally, or when lots of power is available, to
handle heavier-duty computation.</p>
<h2>Computational power needed</h2>
<p>Simply slinging pixel data around is a minimum; at 1 bit per pixel and
400 pixels per character (due to high-res screens), you need to send
50 bytes of data to the framebuffer to draw a single letter or space.
That’s probably about 100 instructions, so 100 instructions/ glyph ×
350 wpm × 6 glyphs / word = 3500 instructions/second.  But that's like
a theoretical minimum.</p>
<p>WordStar on a 2MHz (≈0.5MIPS) 8-bit CPU would sometimes fall behind
your typing a bit.  This suggests that one (8-bit) MIPS is adequate to
provide real-time word processing.</p>
<p>A nanojoule (1000 pJ) per instruction is a microwatt per MIPS, which
would be about 0.56 μA/MIPS (the unit microcontroller vendors like to
use) at 1.8V.  That’s also 1000 giga-ops-per-second per watt.
Low-power microcontrollers are usually 2–5 times better than this.</p>
<h2>Atmel picoPower</h2>
<p>Atmel ARMs can do 250 pJ per 32-bit instruction and 2μW in standby.
However, they take forever to wake up, like tens of microseconds (and
a microsecond is 12 to 48 instructions!).  A full reboot from OFF
takes 2.2 milliseconds.</p>
<p>At this energy cost, 10W would pay for 40 billion instructions per
second, but that would require nearly a thousand microcontrollers.</p>
<p>These are Cortex-M0+s with single-cycle hardware (32×32!) multipliers.
And also a tiny four-cell FPGA called “CCL”, “configurable custom
logic”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.atmel.com/technologies/lowpower/picopower.aspx">http://www.atmel.com/technologies/lowpower/picopower.aspx</a> makes it
hard to tell how low power can go.  They say 1.62V.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8349.pdf">http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8349.pdf</a> gives an example of how to
lower power consumption by lowering clock frequency from 8MHz to
1.8432MHz, transmitting data at 115,200 baud instead of 19,200 baud,
lowering the brownout voltage from the usual 2.7V to 1.8V, and going
to sleep, increasing run-time off a capacitor from 6 seconds to 217
seconds.  However, they never specify the capacitance!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/arm/sam-l.aspx#saml21">http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/arm/sam-l.aspx#saml21</a>
says “power consumption down to 35 µA/MHz in active mode and 200nA in
Sleep mode”.
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42385-SAM-L21_Datasheet.pdf">http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42385-SAM-L21_Datasheet.pdf</a> says
48MHz (the Performance Level 2 model) or 12MHz (the PL0 model), 256kB
flash, 40kB SRAM, 1.62 to 3.63 V, and typically 25 to 100 μA/MHz with
the regulator in buck mode, lower for PL0 than PL2.  75 μA/MHz at 3.3V
in the PL0 model seems like the worst-case performance.  Normalizing
that, we get 250pJ/inst.  Also gives numbers in the 1 to 10 μA for
STANDBY and BACKUP states, depending on temperature, and a bit lower
for OFF.</p>

Atmel ATSAMD10D13A-MUT (US$2.24); datasheet at
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42242-SAM-D10_Datasheet.pdf">http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42242-SAM-D10_Datasheet.pdf</a>.  8 kB
flash, 4 kB RAM, 22 GPIOs.  Worst case 75 μA/MHz (+284μA), which
normalizes to the same 250pJ/inst.  Wakeup time is 4–20μs.</p>
<h2>STM32</h2>
<p>See also <a href="../notes/stm32.html">Notes on the STM32 microcontroller family</a>, but the STM32L low-power ARM microcontroller
series is supposedly 144 pJ/insn, and can reasonably do duty cycles
down to 0.02%, while using 2 mA at 1.8 V at 16 MHz, and the STM32F0
range is 250 pJ/insn.</p>
<h2>ATMega328</h2>
<p>The familiar ATMega328 used in the Arduino isn’t the highest-tech or
lowest-power microcontroller out there, but it’s very well known, and
it’s simple to get running.  It runs at up to 20MHz, with most
instructions in a single cycle, but only 8-bit ALU operations.  In
power-save mode, with a real-time clock enabled, it uses 0.75μA (at
1.8V, so 1.4 μW); at 8MHz and 5V, it uses up to 12mA, so 60mW, working
out to 7500 pJ/instruction.  This is about 30 times worse than the
AT-SAM family and MSP430 family, even before you take into account
that these are 8-bit operations.</p>
<p>Consequently, at 20MHz, this processor will gobble 150mW.</p>
<h2>MSP430</h2>
<p>The von Neumann MSP430 family is in the range of 300–500 pJ per
instruction, 10–25 16-bit MIPS, and 220–4000nW idle, which means
instruction consumption exceeds idle consumption above about three
instructions per second or one wakeup per minute.  At a power budget
of 5mW, an MSP430 could average 12 16-bit MIPS.</p>
<p>These processors are generally the processors of choice for
very-low-duty-cycle applications.</p>

says that in 2010 the F18 consumed 7 pJ per instruction or 450 pJ per
17×17-bit multiply; an MSP430 (at 8MHz) consumed 330 pJ per
instruction or 2310 pJ per 16×16 multiply.  It also gives a
sleep/wakeup time of 4 ns for the F18, with an idle power consumption
of 100 nW, and a sleep/wakeup time of 5μs for the MSP430, with an idle
(LPM4 sleep state) power consumption of 3600 nW.</p>

says that an MSP430G2231 has 2kB flash, 128 bytes RAM, and runs at
16MHz (performing 16-bit operations).  (Also, it gives a nice howto
for getting a TI Launchpad device working with Debian.)  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/msp430-gcc-opensource">http://www.ti.com/tool/msp430-gcc-opensource</a> is TI’s deprecated but
actively maintained port of GCC.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_MSP430A">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_MSP430A</a> says the FRAM series of
MSP430s has 320 nA RAM retention and 82 μA/MIPS, which is half the
power consumption of other MSP430s, with up to 2 kB of RAM.  Other
MSP430s have up to 512kB of ROM or 10kB of RAM.  Normalizing these
numbers using 3.3V, which ought to be about right, we get 271 pJ/insn
and 1100 nW.  The MSP430G2xx series has sub-microsecond wakeup, 0.1μA
RAM retention, and 220μA/MIPS at 2.2V, or 480 pJ/insn and 220nW idle.</p>
<h2>Experimental subthreshold processor</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.eit.lth.se/fileadmin/eit/courses/eit095f/Hanson_Variability_J_2008.pfd">http://www.eit.lth.se/fileadmin/eit/courses/eit095f/Hanson_Variability_J_2008.pfd</a>
describes an 8-bit processor that works at 350 mV and uses
3.5 pJ/instruction, two orders of magnitude less than the MSP430.
<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~taustin/papers/VLSI-subliminal.pdf">https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~taustin/papers/VLSI-subliminal.pdf</a>
describes it again more briefly.

describes another one that reaches 2.6 pJ/inst at 833kHz.  None of
these processors are commercially available.</p>
<h2>CoolRisc 81</h2>
<p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.25.1097&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.25.1097&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>
says the CoolRisc 81 uses 22 pJ/inst.  In 2001!</p>
<h2>Brains</h2>
<p><a href="http://icri-ci.technion.ac.il/files/2013/07/Karlheinz-Meier_red2.pdf">http://icri-ci.technion.ac.il/files/2013/07/Karlheinz-Meier_red2.pdf</a>
Neurons use about 10 fJ (0.01 pJ) per neural spike (action potential)
per synapse.  It is not yet feasible to use them to build a portable
computer.</p>
<h2>Energy storage</h2>
<p>A solar-powered computer could still be somewhat useful at night if it
can store some energy.  But standard batteries are flaky and break
after a few years, so fuck them.  And we’re talking about a
super-low-power device, one that might use under 10mW when in active
use, so even storing 1 joule of energy is potentially useful (100
seconds), 10 joules could last you 20 minutes, and 100 joules could
last you three hours.</p>
<p>But how can you store 100 joules without batteries?  I haven’t found a
good way.</p>
<p>If you can reduce the power consumption below 1mW, then a smaller
amount of energy storage would be feasible.</p>
<h3>Solid-state cell energy storage</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/Cymbet-WP-EnerChips-vs-Supercaps.pdf">http://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/Cymbet-WP-EnerChips-vs-Supercaps.pdf</a>
claims that supercapacitors discharge at 10%–20% per day, while
EnerChips (theoretically on the market but not in stock at Digi-Key)
discharge at 1%–2% per <em>year</em>.</p>
<p>These solid-state batteries use a thin-film solid with ionic
conduction as their electrolyte, so they are fully solid-state,
despite the mobility of ions within them.</p>

discusses some new research on solid-state electrolytes for lithium
batteries in more detail.

is a press release about the paper.</p>
<h3>Capacitor power storage</h3>
<p>Solid-state capacitors are the physically stablest medium for storing
a few joules of energy for short periods of time.  They are low in
capacity and expensive.  To store 1J, a capacitor needs:</p>
<pre><code>| E &lt;   | C &gt;      |
| 3V    | 0.2 F    |
| 10V   | 20000 μF |
| 50V   | 800 μF   |
| 100V  | 200 μF   |
| 300V  | 22 μF    |
| 1000V | 2 μF     |
</code></pre>
<h4>Ceramics</h4>
<p>Ceramic capacitors generally do not have the necessary energy
capacity.</p>

<h4>Films</h4>
<p>Some film capacitors are designed for high voltages and consequently
have substantial energy capacity.  You could hook up the output side
of an ordinary switchmode power supply (the part after the rectifier)
designed for 240VAC line current to many of these, because in normal
use a 240VAC-input SMPS’s capacitors will be charged up to 340V.

<h4>Supercapacitors</h4>
<p>These are newish (like, the last 30 years).  I’m not sure they can be
trusted to last a long time; the numbers I’m seeing on Digi-Key’s page
are like “1000 hours at 70°”.

talks about the failure modes; it says they degrade little by little
over time, although even after 5 years their 4.2V 470 mF supercap
holds 2 J; they claim that their flat packages do a better job of
keeping moisture out and electrolyte in than cylindrical packages,
showing a degradation to 80% of capacity after 3000h (4 months).  It
also mentions that leakage current is around a microamp.  On p.20 it
shows a dryup lifetime graph, showing that even their DMT products
will dry up in only 20 years at 70°, while their DMF products will dry
up in only 5 years at 40°; on p.23 it explains that at 5.5V, their DMF
will break after only 500 hours at 70° or 6400 hours (9 months) at
40°, while the DMT will last dramatically longer, like 40,000 hours at
70°.</p>

<h4>Batteries</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10319">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10319</a> is a 24.5 mm × 3.0 mm 3.6V
LIR2450 rechargeable coin cell, rated for 110 mAh, which is 1430 J.
It costs US$3.
<a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/218655/running-3-3v-mcu-from-lir2032-lithium-ion-button-cell">https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/218655/running-3-3v-mcu-from-lir2032-lithium-ion-button-cell</a>
cites a LIR2032 (20 mm × 3.0 mm) cell with 40 mAh at 3–4.2 V, 520 J.</p>
<p>Horowitz &amp; Hill (the 1989 edition with the micropower chapter) says
that commonplace batteries (9-volt and AA batteries) “give nearly
their full shelf life at drain currents less than 20μA.”  At 2 V and
200 pJ/insn (reasonable ballpark figures, though the STM32L does
better) this works out to an average of 200 000 instructions per
second.  At 1400mAh for an ordinary 1.5 AA cell, of which you would
need two (or a boost converter), this is 6 years, which is indeed
comparable to the battery’s shelf life.  At 1 MIPS, the two-cell
battery only lasts a year.</p>
<p>I bought a couple of rechargeable NiMH AA batteries the other day for
some absurd price, like US$10 or something.  They claim 2000 mAh,
1.2V, which is 8.6 kJ (per cell).  At the full 3.5 mW power of a
16 MHz STM32L at 1.8V (see <a href="../notes/stm32.html">Notes on the STM32 microcontroller family</a>), that would run for 28 days.</p>
<h5>Zamboni piles</h5>
<p>A cell of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamboni_pile">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamboni_pile</a> yields 0.8
volts, but only a few nA, and the Clarendon Dry Pile has been ringing
its bell since 1840.  The cell is perhaps 20mm in diameter, but &lt;1mm
thick; you could easily stack three of them to get 2.4 volts,
perfectly adequate to run a microcontroller on without regulation.  In
particular, the Clarendon Dry Pile produces about 1 nA at 2 kV,
consuming about 1 μg from each of its cells over the last 144 years,
according to Croft’s 1984 paper, “The Oxford electric bell.”  He
doesn’t give dimensions but the dry pile seems to be about 30mm in
diameter, i.e. 700mm².</p>
<p>However, at least STM32s have a minimal current consumption of a few
hundred nA (180 nA in standby mode with no RTC, 410 nA in standby mode
with RTC).  This would require, say, 500 times the cross-sectional
area of the Clarendon battery: perhaps a 3-meter roll of 120mm-wide
battery.  If the total thickness were 1mm, the battery would be
350 mℓ.  This seems like a small price to pay for a battery life
measured in centuries, as long as the device doesn’t have to be
portable.</p>

Flash in the same 8-pin SOIC format, and it's much cheaper, US$0.36.
Being Flash, it uses no power for “standby” but a lot of power to
erase (10 mA for 500 ms to erase 32 kB ≈ 500 nJ/byte), but <a href="http://www.adestotech.com/wp-content/uploads/DS-AT25SF041_044.pdf">“only” 4
