(1 minute)</div><p>A PLL is great for tracking the frequency of a sine wave.  But lots of
sounds we want to track the pitch of aren’t sine waves; they have
substantial energy in their harmonics.  The usual chopper PLL approach
detects phase by multiplying the input signal with a square wave, thus
convolving its spectrum with a spectrum containing significant third
and fifth harmonics, but no even harmonics, then low-pass filters the
result to try to separate out the dc component.</p>
<p>As a possible alternative for software PLLs, maybe you could try using
the Karplus-Strong string model for your phase detection, using two
delay lines that differ in length by one sample.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
