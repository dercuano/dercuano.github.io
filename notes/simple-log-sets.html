(6 minutes)</div><p>An in-memory dictionary with O(lg² N) lookups, O(lg N) amortized
insertions, O(lg lg N) key-ordered traversal, dramatically better
memory usage and cache behavior than binary search trees, persistence
in Okasaki’s sense, and very simple code.</p>
<p>Search trees store sets or bags in logarithmic time.  The simplest
search-tree algorithms are very simple indeed, although they use a lot
of memory and a lot of random memory seeks; but they degrade to linear
search in the worst case.  Advanced search trees like red-black trees
and B*-trees fix these problems, but at the cost of great algorithmic
complexity.</p>
<p>A perfectly-balanced binary search tree can be represented without
pointers, as an array; the usual binary heap algorithms work this way,
taking the nodes at 2N and 2N+1 as the children of the node at N (or
2N+1 and 2N+2, if you’re zero-based.)  Alternatively and equivalently,
you can use binary search: a subtree of 2N+1 nodes is comprised of the
concatenation of a left subtree of N nodes, a single root node, and a
right subtree of N nodes.  These two representations are equivalent
and interchangeable, and they share the problem that inserting into
them is O(N) rather than O(lg N).  (The binary-heap approach seems
like it should have better cache behavior for lookups, and worse for
sequential traversal.)</p>
<p>Lucene handles a similar problem by maintaining its index as a set of
O(lg N) “index segments”, each of which is sorted.  Insertion takes
the form of generating a new index segment, while a search requires
doing an O(lg N) search in each of the O(lg N) segments.  Creating a
new index segment may result in merging some existing index segments
into larger index segments.</p>
<p>(Lucene’s data structure, because it requires only sequential writes
to new segments and never random writes, is also well-suited for
concurrency and variable-sized data items.)</p>
<p>The simplest version of this approach would make the index segments
powers of two, with a maximum of one index segment of each possible
size.  So if you had index segments of sizes 1, 2, 4, 16, and 64, then
after inserting a new datum, you would have index segments of sizes 8,
16, and 64, having merged the three smallest segments together.  (It
might simplify the search of each individual index segment to use
powers of two minus one: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, and so on.  But then you’d
need to allow up to two segments of any given size.)</p>
<p>It’s straightforward to see that you’ll have between 1 and lg N
segments, and that the average case will be ceil(lg N)/2.  An
insertion will cause zero merges half the time, one merge a quarter of
the time, two merges an eighth of the time, three merges a sixteenth
of the time, and so on, for an amortized constant of two merges per
insertion.  Those merges are mostly small and fast: four-item merges
are half as common as two-item merges, eight-item merges half as
common as four-item merges, sixteen-item merges half as common as
eight-item merges, and so on.  However, this series still fails to
converge, which makes sense since in its infinite form it represents
the work of inserting into an already-infinite set.  If you terminate
it after N terms, it represents the work of inserting into a set of
2**N items, and it adds up to N.</p>
<p>As with trees, this approach supports “persistent” data structures,
where you can hang on to a previous version of the structure simply by
holding onto a pointer to it, sharing state with current versions — as
long as you store it as a linked list, going from the smallest to the
largest index segments.  You lose the amortized time guarantee,
though; if you save off a version with 1023 items in it and then make
100 modified versions of it with one item added, you’ll do a 1024-item
merge for each of those 100 modified versions, for 102400 total work.</p>
<p>This data structure is asymptotically slower than a binary tree for
lookup, since doing a lookup takes O(lg² N) probes — for example, in a
42-item dictionary, you must search in the 2-item array (1½ probes),
the 8-item array (3⅛ probes), and the 32-item array (about 5 probes),
for a total of 9⅝ probes, while a perfectly balanced binary tree would
take slightly over 5.  In a 2730-item dictionary, you must do that and
also carry out 7 probes in the 128-item array, 9 probes in the
512-item array, and 11 probes in the 2048-item dictionary, for a total
of a bit over 36 probes, while a perfectly-balanced tree would take
under 12 probes.  I’ve chosen the numbers 42 and 2730 because they’re
uncharacteristically average.</p>
<p>(Here I’m assuming that you must examine every candidate location,
either because your lookup is unsuccessful or because you could
theoretically have more than one value for a given key, but don’t.  In
the case where keys are guaranteed unique, you may be able to stop
earlier, but I think that doesn’t affect the asymptotic time; and if
you actually do have multiple values per key, the worst case is that
you have to return every value.)</p>
<p>If we allow index segments with less than the maximum possible number
of keys, it’s possible to run an O(N lg lg N) “optimization” pass on
the data structure, sorting everything into a single array.
Thereafter lookups will be O(lg N).</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
