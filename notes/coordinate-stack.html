(9 minutes)</div><p>I thought I had a novel way of thinking about automatic APL-style
lifting of pointwise operators, and it yielded some interesting
suggestions, but I think it turns out it kind of sucks as a generic
way of thinking about APL operators.  Here I document my blind alley
in case other people find it interesting.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>In APL, you can write 4 + 5 and get 9, or 4 + 3 4 5 6 and get 7 8 9
10, or 4 5 6 + 2 3 8 and get 6 8 14.  And you can similarly add a
vector to a matrix, and each element of the vector will be added to an
entire row (or column, depending on your point of view) of the matrix.
And so on.</p>
<h2>The Basic Approach</h2>
<p>So here's a way to think about that.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a (possibly finite) stack of coordinate contexts, each
of which contains one coordinate, and each of our values is a function
of this stack.  Scalars don't look at the stack at all.  Vectors look
at the top item on the stack to figure out which scalar to return.
Matrices look at the top two.  Now we consider our language's
e.g. multiplication to be pointwise multiplication over these
functions.</p>
<p>Suppose we use + to denote mathematical addition and +. to denote the
addition operator of our language.  Then we can say</p>
<pre><code>x + y = \ C . x(C) +. y(C)  where C is a coordinate stack.
</code></pre>
<p>So if x and y are both scalars, then so is the result; if one is a
vector and the other is a scalar, then the result will be a vector, in
that it will depend on the top item of the coordinate stack for one side
of the addition; and so on.  This automatically provides the desired
behavior for binary operators on vectors of different ranks.</p>
<p>Unintuitively, the indices that we normally think of as changing
fastest are further down the stack.</p>
<p>Can we define other APL functions this way?</p>
<h2>Transpose and Compose</h2>
<p>If we want to define the transposition operator that transposes the
first two indices, we can define it in terms of cons, car, and cdr
functions on coordinate stacks.  car returns the top index off the
stack; cdr returns a coordinate stack missing that top index; and cons
returns a coordinate stack with a new car pushed on top of what was
previously there.</p>
<pre><code>transpose x = \ C . x(cons (car (cdr C)) (cons (car C) (cdr (cdr C))))
</code></pre>
<p>That's just the Forth SWAP or the PostScript exch operator.  It's
probably clearer if I write it with Haskell's right-associative infix
cons operator ':' and pattern-matching:</p>
<pre><code>transpose x = \a:b:z . x (b:a:z)
</code></pre>
<p>If we define transpose this way, then we can apply it to a scalar ---
but the resulting value will require at least two stack levels that it
actually ignores, i.e. will be an infinite matrix.  I could add
error-checking cases to transpose to handle this.</p>
<p>(XXX this is wrong.  What you want is something that transposes the
two leftmost indices, the ones that change slowest, not the ones that
chnage fastest.)</p>
<p>There's a useful operator that Numeric calls "take", and which APL
implements by indexing one array with another (e.g. 4 5 6[1 2 1]
yields 4 5 4, and 4 5 6[2 3 rho 1 2 2 1 3 1] yields 2 3 rho 4 5 5 4 6 4).</p>
<p>In its most basic form it only applies to a one-dimensional array as
its first argument.  I'll call it "compose".  Can we define this
"compose" operator?</p>
<pre><code>compose(lookuptable, indices) = \C.lookuptable(cons(indices(C), nil))
</code></pre>
<p>That is, we create a new coordinate stack to use to index the
lookuptable, consisting only of the values from indices.  That's OK
for one-dimensional lookuptables, but maybe we can generalize it so
that it does the right thing if the elements of the lookuptable are
vectors or more complicated things.</p>
<p>To do that, we need to provide the leftover elements of the coordinate
stack --- the ones not needed to index into indices --- to lookuptable
in place of the nil.</p>
<h2>Taking Rank Into Account</h2>
<p>So now we need to consider each array as more than just a function
from coordinate stacks to scalars; now we also care about its rank
(although that was obvious from the start, since without knowing its
rank and also its size in each dimension, we can't do simple things
like display it on the screen).</p>
<p>So now I am losing interest, because I think this way of thinking
about it doesn't actually simplify things any over the traditional
view (where an array consists of a vector of dimensions and a vector
of contents).  But I'll pursue it just a little bit longer.  Let's
call the contents function of x "x.f", and its rank function, which
tells how many items it cares about on the coordinate stack, "x.r",
and write { f = x.f, r = x.r } to express a new one identical to x.
So we have</p>
<pre><code>x + y = { f = \ C . x.f(C) +. y.f(C), r = max(x.r, y.r) }
transpose x = { f = \a:b:z . x.f(b:a:z), r = x.r }
compose(lookuptable, indices) = {
    f = \ C . lookuptable.f(cons(indices.f(C), dropn(C, indices.r))),
    r = indices.r + lookuptable.r - 1
} where dropn(X, 0) = X and dropn(X, N&gt;0) = cdr dropn(X, N-1)
</code></pre>
<p>The more general form of the "+" case for scalar binary operations is</p>
<pre><code>scalarop(op, x, y) = { f = \C . op(x.f(C), y.f(C)), r = max(x.r, y.r) }
</code></pre>
<p>You could treat arbitrary unary scalar operations as if they were
vectors, then apply them with compose:</p>
<pre><code>opvalue(op) = { f = \C . op(car C), r = 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could have a scalarunop:</p>
<pre><code>scalarunop(op, x) = { f = \C . op(x C), r = x.r }
</code></pre>
<p>(It seems like you ought to be able to derive the "r"s mechanically
from the expressions for the stacks to which you're applying the "f"s.
In the transpose case, the stack is still the same height, so the rank
is the same; in the compose case, we drop indices.r items from the
stack and then add one, so we need an extra indices.r - 1 items.  But
I'm not quite sure how to do that yet.)</p>
<p>The other basic Forth stack manipulation operators also have
interesting functions.  DUP, diminishing the rank by 1, takes the
diagonal of a matrix; DROP, increasing the rank by 1, turns a vector
into a matrix so that it can be applied column-wise.  For now I'm not
going to think about OVER (diagonal between first and third
dimensions?), ROT (rearranging the order of the top three
coordinates?), NIP, TUCK, 2DUP, and 2DROP.</p>
<h2>Iota</h2>
<p>One-dimensional monadic iota is fairly straightforward; its content
function doesn't depend at all on its argument.  (Only its size does,
and we haven't talked about size yet.)</p>
<pre><code>iota = { f = car, r = 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>APL's N-dimensional monadic iota is kind of stupid; it takes the
values produced by the one-dimensional iota --- as many as needed ---
and then reshapes them into the requested shape.</p>
<p>Numerical Python has a somewhat more general operation called
"indices".  Applied to a vector describing an N-dimensional shape, it
returns N sets of indices, each of which has the shape requested, and
contains the Nth index.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Numeric.indices((2, 3))
array([[[0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1]],
       [[0, 1, 2],
        [0, 1, 2]]])
</code></pre>
<p>So the first top-level item has the first coordinate of each location,
the second item has the second coordinate, etc.  That is,
Numeric.indices((a,b))[0][x][y] == x, and
Numeric.indices((a,b))[1][x][y] == y.  This sounds stupid but is very
useful if you want to tabulate values of N-dimensional functions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's a little clumsy to work with in the one-dimensional
case, because iota (which it calls "arange") is wrapped in another
layer of nesting.  It's a little clumsy to define in this system;
although its pointwise value is, like iota, just one of the
coordinates, the number that specifies which coordinate is hidden deep
in the stack, and counts backward from there.</p>
<pre><code>indices(dims) = {
    f(C) = C[length(dims) - C[length(dims)] - 1],
    r = length(dims) + 1 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The "- 1" is there to make the coordinates zero-based.</p>
<h2>Reshape</h2>
<p>Reshape (dyadic rho) is extremely simple in the standard
representation, and rather a dog's breakfast in this one.</p>
<h2>Reduce</h2>
<p>Reduce ought to work by default along the axis that changes slowest,
and that's kind of ugly here.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It was a cute idea --- especially the Forth stack manipulations
turning into operations --- but I think it makes things more
complicated, not less.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
