(1 minute)</div><p>Photovoltaic cells are generally made with a PIN structure, with a
large undoped intrinsic region between the P and N doped regions.  I
think that such a PIN diode, when back-biased (the normal case with a
photovoltaic cell) will conduct like the avalanche tube of a Geiger
counter when exposed to gamma rays or some other kinds of
radioactivity.</p>
<p>There are cheaper PIN diodes available than solar cells, but for
detecting radioactivity, a large total area is advantageous.</p>
<p>opengeiger.de has an open design for a PIN-diode-based Geiger counter
using a low-capacitance PIN diode.</p>
<p>Probably the most practical radioactivity sources for testing such a
Geiger counter are radioactive fluorescent light starters (now,
thankfully, becoming obsolete) and supermarket potassium chloride,
which emits mostly β particles and some gamma rays.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
