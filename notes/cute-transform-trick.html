(2 minutes)</div><p>There's a trick I think I saw originally in REXX, and which I think
originally comes from the IBM mainframe world.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a record with some fixed format and you want to
reformat it.  For example, you have this:</p>
<pre><code>199712100036325SITTLER   KRAGEN
</code></pre>
<p>And you want to reformat it to this:</p>
<pre><code>KRAGEN    SITTLER    $00363.25  10/12/1997
</code></pre>
<p>The thing that would make this easy would be if you could write a
couple of "picture" lines showing the desired input and output, and
have software apply the transformation automatically:</p>
<pre><code>199712100036325SITTLER   KRAGEN    
19YyMmDd2345678OPQRSTUVWXopqrstuvwx
opqrstuvwxOPQRSTUVWX $23456.78  Dd/Mm/19Yy
KRAGEN    SITTLER    $00363.25  10/12/1997
</code></pre>
<p>So far that's nothing terribly special.  You use the correspondence of
the characters in the before-and-after picture to show where to move
the input characters around to in the output.</p>
<p>The special part is that it turns out you can implement this with a
simple character substitution, the same kind of thing you would use to
transform uppercase to lowercase or vice versa, or remove accents from
ISO-8859-1 text for accent-insensitive comparison, or translate
between EBCDIC and ASCII.  Here's what it looks like in Python.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; the_input = '199712100036325SITTLER   KRAGEN    '
&gt;&gt;&gt; beforepic = '19YyMmDd2345678OPQRSTUVWXopqrstuvwx'
&gt;&gt;&gt; afterpic  = 'opqrstuvwxOPQRSTUVWX $23456.78  Dd/Mm/19Yy'
&gt;&gt;&gt; cipher = string.maketrans(beforepic, the_input)
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.translate(afterpic, cipher)
'KRAGEN    SITTLER    $00363.25  10/12/1997'
</code></pre>
<p>So first we compute a character substitution that would convert
<code>beforepic</code> into <code>the_input</code>.  Then we apply that substitution to
<code>afterpic</code>, and we get the desired output.</p>
<p>It's not a very versatile trick --- all the characters in <code>beforepic</code>
have to be distinct, so it can't work in this form for anything over
256 bytes, it only handles fixed-width fields, and you can see I had a
hard time coming up with reasonable-looking characters to use in the
templates even in this small example.  But the clever thing about it
is that, given the existing ability to translate a string of
characters according to such a table of correspondences, and the
ability to construct such a table from a before and after string, it
only takes a couple of lines of code.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
