(4 minutes)</div><p>Every program is a real-time program; late answers are wrong answers,
because every system has a user, and users do not live forever, and
they have a discount rate.</p>
<p>A traditional way to ensure that your programs don't miss their hard
real-time deadline is to calculate a worst-case run time for your
algorithms, then ensure that your input doesn't get big enough to make
your run time miss the deadline.  This requires analyzing the compiled
program.</p>
<p>A different way is to use anytime algorithms; these are algorithms
that you can keep running until you are about to run out of time, then
get an answer.  In general, if you don't run them long enough, the
answer you get isn't very good, but in many cases it's still better
than no answer.  And it's a <em>lot</em> easier to verify that an anytime
algorithm hits its deadline.</p>
<p>There are several different classes of anytime algorithms; two of the
common ones are Monte Carlo algorithms and numerical optimization
algorithms.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo algorithms, such as particle filters, work by doing a
large number of random trials and producing some sort of aggregate
answer from them.  For example, if you're ray-tracing, you can shoot
rays at random into your scene, ideally several per pixel.  This is,
as far as I can tell, how Blender ensures that its visual feedback on
rotation of complex objects will will always be instantaneous.  It's
also the way people basically always do radiosity rendering, as far as
I know.</p>
<p>Numerical optimization algorithms seek to find an answer that
minimizes some "error" or "loss" function by manipulating some "design
variables" within a "feasible region", and they find better and better
answers when you run them longer.  Large systems of linear equations
these days are solved by successive over-relaxation, which is an
example of such an algorithm, but there are a whole family of fairly
generally applicable optimization algorithms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Random sampling: generate random sets of design variables,
remembering the best one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hill-climbing: incrementally mutate your best set of design
variables at random, undoing each mutation that worsens the loss
function.  Random restarts make this relatively robust against local
minima.  If you decrease the magnitude of the mutations over time this
is "simulated annealing".  It can be slow in a many-dimensional design
space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genetic algorithms: just like hill-climbing, but you maintain a
bunch of different sets of design variables instead of just one at a
time, and you cross them with each other, and you make more mutated
versions of the ones that are doing best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gradient descent: just like hill-climbing, except that you
calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to your
design variables, so that you can incrementally mutate all of your
design variables in the direction that decreases the loss function the
most, instead of at random like in hill-climbing.  If your design
space is many-dimensional, this is a lot faster than hill-climbing,
but it requires you to be able to calculate the derivatives.  This is
why automatic differentiation is so hot in the last few years.  It
also benefits from random restarts, a lot of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newton-Raphson iteration: vaguely related to gradient descent in
that your next guess is where you would linearly extrapolate that the
loss function hits zero according to the gradient.  This is <em>much</em>
faster than gradient descent for some things.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously all of these can benefit from massive databases of existing
designs and clever neural network stuff to speed them up.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
