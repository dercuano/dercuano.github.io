(1 minute)</div><p>A better shell might have some or all of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opens a new pty for each command and allows you to either include
  the whole command output or a scrollable window on it in the overall
  scroll.  Clearing the screen should, by default, fullscreen the
  command output.</li>
<li>Displays which commands failed and which relied on now-changed
  inputs.  (This requires tracking the inputs of every command.)</li>
<li>Optionally re-executes selected commands periodically</li>
<li>Displays per-command resource usage, such as CPU time and RAM usage.
  By default runs commands with limits to prevent horking the whole
  machine.</li>
<li>Provides notifications of finished, idle, and newly non-idle
  commands in a way that doesn’t interfere with foreground tasks.
  This requires at least some minimum UI for configuring it.</li>
<li>Copes with voluminous command output gracefully, at least up to
  gigabytes.  Should have options to FIFO-discard, block (like ^S),
  and increase the scrollback-retention limit.</li>
<li>Supports distributed operation, including running commands on remote
  hosts, inside of Docker containers, and across multiple remote
  hosts, as well as session recovery from network disconnection and
  even machine restart.</li>
<li>Options for fancifying command output; for example, hyperlinking
  <code>ls</code> and <code>ps</code> output, or colorizing and relayouting other commands’
  output.</li>
<li>Programmable autocomplete, of course.</li>
