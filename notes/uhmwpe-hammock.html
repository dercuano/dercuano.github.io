(11 minutes)</div><p>How much would a minimal UHMWPE hammock (i.e. a net woven from
ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) weigh?</p>
<p>A standard hammock setup reaches 4–6 meters from anchor to anchor,
with a hang angle 30° below the horizontal, so the bottom is 1–1.5 m
below the anchor points when you’re sitting at a point in the middle,
and the total length of the hammock then is about 4.5–6.7 m.</p>
<p>UHMWPE is springy enough that you don’t need any safety factor for
dynamic loads.  Suppose the hammock needs to be able to support
200 kg, i.e. 2.0 kN, vertically, or 1.0 kN on each support.  This
requires the tension in the cord to be 2.0 kN diagonally to have a
1.0 kN vertical component, so the support cord needs to resist 2.0 kN.
I don’t have stats on UHMWPE handy at the moment, but suppose its
tensile strength is 500 MPa, which is probably in about the right
range — that’s the strength of poorly-heat-treated ordinary steel
bolts.  Then you need 4 mm² of cross-sectional area to support you.</p>
<p>If your hammock were just a cord, that would be all — you need 6.7 m
of 4 mm² cord, 2.3 mm in diameter if it’s circular, and you can sit on
it.  And it would weigh 26 grams at 0.96 g/mℓ.</p>
<p>However, the hammock net spreads out over an area, and you need to not
have it break when you’re sitting on just part of it.  It probably
needs to be able to spread out to at least 700 mm wide, and any, say,
100 mm of the width needs to not break when you sit on it.  That means
the net needs to be about 7 times stronger: 14.0 kN, and thus 28 mm²,
which will form a sort of rope about 6.0 mm in diameter when you twist
it up.  Also, the spacing of the lines in the net needs to be close
enough that any particular 100 mm of its width has about the same
strength, so you need at least 4 lines in that width — and that seems
challenging to fabricate, because it means you need 28 knots and at
times 56 lines across the whole width, so let’s stick with 4.  Then
you need knots along the length at somewhat regular intervals — let’s
say, every 50 mm.</p>
<p>This sort of implies that each line only has a strength of 14/56 =
250 N, or 25 kg.  This may be a little low — you might be able to
break it by hand if you have some kind of tool to keep the line from
cutting your hand, like a stick or something — but maybe it’s okay.</p>
<p>If the net part of the hammock is 2 m long, then it contains
2 m · 28 mm² = 56 mℓ or 54 g of line, which is divided among 56 lines
of 0.80 mm diameter and 0.5 mm² cross-sectional area.  There are about
28 · 2000 mm / 50 mm = 1120 knots in the net, so tying it by hand is
probably a few hours of work.  The remaining 4.7 m of support are
still only 4 mm² and so are only 19 mℓ = 18 g of line, giving a total
of 72 grams.</p>
<p>The circumference of each net hole there is 100 mm, which is hopefully
small enough to prevent injury.</p>
<p>This doesn’t include anything to connect the support to, such as a
tree-hugging loop or a carabiner or a hook.</p>
<p>If you wanted to include an airproof barrier, 100 microns of boPET
under the hammock would probably be adequate, although you could make
reasonable arguments for 200μm LDPE or HDPE — they would be quieter
and less likely to rip.  2 m · 700 mm · 100 μm, disregarding the
narrowing at the ends, works out to 140 mℓ, which is almost twice the
volume of the net hammock itself; it’s also about than twice the mass,
as PET is almost the same density but slightly denser.  Sheets and
blankets are heavier still.  So we can see that the structural support
is a minority of the mass of the overall hammock.</p>
<p>Update: UHMWPE fiber normally has, apparently, 2.4 GPa of tensile
strength.  This means the 4.7 m of 2kN support line need only be
0.83 mm², 1.3 mm in diameter, and the 250 N net lines need only be
0.104 mm² individually (360 μm in diameter), 5.8 mm²
collectively — 2.7 mm in diameter.  The overall hammock would occupy
2 m · 5.8 mm² + 4.7 m · 0.83 mm² = 15.5 mℓ, 14.9 g.</p>
<p>If it’s possible to actually make this work, it would be pretty
stunning: a hammock you can sleep in that’s roughly one tablespoon in
volume when rolled up.</p>
<hr />
<p>I tried a minimal version of this: six strands of 500μm UHMWPE
stretched between two metal wall hooks, a total of about 24 m.  I was
able to sit on it for a while, but then it broke in two places.  The
snapped cord showed a bit of curling, suggesting either that the shock
of breaking deformed it plastically, or that it had deformed
plastically ahead of time.  It’s possible I might have mistreated the
cords while letting them out, running them around the metal hooks — I
might have generated too much heat, melting the cord.</p>
<p>I don’t have my scale handy, but this amount of cord ought to occupy
4.7 mℓ and thus weigh about 5 g.  If it were a single cord, it should
be 1.2 mm in diameter (500 μm √6).  This is close to the 1.3 mm I
calculated for the 2kN support line, but the fact that it broke
without me even jumping around on it makes me think that I should
probably double or triple it.  Also, though, it’s possible that my
weight distribution might have been unequal across the lines.</p>
<p>Knots are consistently weak points, not just in the usual way where
they put extra stress on rope fibers, but also because UHMWPE is so
slippery that it tends to slide out of knots.  My first attempt to
reconstitute my backpack buckles using UHMWPE and steel rings failed
when I pulled on it, not because the thread broke, but because the
sheet bend came untied.</p>
<p>A bit of analysis suggests that stretching 1 m of 1mm² UHMWPE cord to
its 2.4 GPa limit requires 2.4 kN; if this elongates it by 2% = 20 mm,
implying a 120 GPa Young’s modulus (a bit over half of steel’s) and
close to the 66–124 (Spectra) and 115 (Dyneema) given in
<a href="http://www.mse.mtu.edu/~drjohn/my4150/props.html">http://www.mse.mtu.edu/~drjohn/my4150/props.html</a>.  Assuming
linearity, that’s 24 J of energy stored in 1 mℓ (≈ 1 g) of fiber.  The
5 g I broke should then be able to store about 120 J as spring energy
before breaking.  Unfortunately, that’s my body moving at a bit under
2 m/s.</p>
<p>(This is similar to calculations I did in <a href="../notes/spring-energy-density.html">Spring energy density</a>
for the specific energy of different spring materials.)</p>
<p>This gets worse if, as suggested above, the main body of the hammock
has a cross-sectional area much larger than that of the support line,
while being made of the same material, because the main body of the
hammock then won’t stretch much at all when you sit in it; all the
stretch will be taken up by the thinner support lines.</p>
<p>I was thinking that sticking it in series with some kind of spring
might help to protect it against shocks, but I don’t know what kind of
spring.  Nylon, from the same page, has 1.36 g/cc, 2.5 GPa Young’s
modulus, and 100 MPa tensile yield strength, but supposedly also has
like 90% elongation at break rather than the 4% you’d calculate from
those figures.  (<a href="https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=477">https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=477</a>
explains: 6,6 nylon does indeed have 4.5% strain at yield, but also
60% elongation at break.)  If we take the 60% figure, but figure that
the engineering stress is limited to 100 MPa over nearly all of the
distance, we get the remarkable result that our 1m × 1mm² fiber can
elongate to 1.6 m under a force of 100 N, absorbing 60 J of energy in
the process, more than twice what the UHMWPE fiber can absorb.  This
is an improvement, but not good enough to justify it.</p>
<p>Maybe a hyperelastic material like latex rubber would be a better
choice.  Latex has roughly 1500% elongation at break.  Some loops cut
from a bicycle inner tube might be most practical, despite their
suboptimal properties.  The 2012 “Characterization of Natural Rubber
Latex Film Containing Various Enhancers”
<a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82660375.pdf">https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82660375.pdf</a> got an ultimate tensile
strength of 0.34 MPa and 1400% elongation at break, but unfortunately
they did not plot the stress-strain curve.  Surely the ultimate
tensile strength here is simply incorrect; other sources give tensile
strengths in the neighborhood of 10–20 MPa, such as
<a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/26306/1JTS_ETD.pdf">https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/26306/1JTS_ETD.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>If we assume that it’s linear (probably conservative for
hyperelasticity) and that in practice we don’t want to exceed 500%
elongation, then we can put it under, say, 5 MPa of stress.</p>
<p>If we were to do the same experiment with our hypothetical 1 m × 1 mm²
shape, but this time made from rubber, we would stretch it out to 6 m
while averaging 2.5 MPa and 2.5 N.  This is a rather pathetic 12 J.</p>
<p>Rhett Allain did some simple experiments
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-energy-can-you-store-in-a-rubber-band/">https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-energy-can-you-store-in-a-rubber-band/</a>
to derive a specific energy of 1.7 kJ/kg in tension for the rubber
bands he had lying around the office.  That means that absorbing an
impact of 250 J would require 150 g of rubber.</p>
<p>So rubber is good for limiting forces given a fixed acceleration, like
when you have something mounted on a vibrating chassis, but it isn’t
particularly good at absorbing a fixed impact energy.  UHMWPE is many
times better than rubber at that, and nylon is twice as good as
UHMWPE, albeit dissipatively.  (And presumably plastics like LDPE
(7 MPa, 400%), PET (100 MPa, 300%), polycarbonate (100 MPa, 200%), and
polycaprolactone (10 MPa, 300%, though I think I’ve seen more like
1000%) are better still (see

and

if you’re willing to allow plastic deformation, making the shock
absorber consumable.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
