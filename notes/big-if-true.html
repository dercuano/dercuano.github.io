<p>As I pointed out in <a href="../index.html">the Dercuano introductory text</a>,
Dercuano contains much that is correct and original, but mostly what
is original is not correct, and what is correct is not original.  I
think that phrase originated as a clever insult to somebody’s poor
work, but in a sense it’s just the default state of human cognition:
most of the new ideas we come up with are wrong, while most of our
ideas are not new, and since correct ideas have better memetic fitness
(all else being equal) our unoriginal ideas tend toward correctness.
With enough focused effort it’s possible to figure out which original
ideas are true, and if I were capable, I would have made that effort
before making Dercuano public, but I haven’t managed it in many years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there’s a third axis along which ideas can be
evaluated, aside from (probable) correctness and originality:
consequences or interestingness.</p>
<h2>What’s a big idea?  What are consequences?</h2>
<p>In <a href="../notes/3d-printing-stone.html">Approaches to 3-D printing in sandstone</a>, for example, it says that in Argentina in
2017, ordinary gray portland cement cost US$0.26 per kg, while the
white grade cost about three times as much.  Conceivably nobody has
made this observation before, and quite probably it is a correct
observation, so it is likely correct and, in a minimal sense,
original.  But it really matters very little whether the price ratio
was 1:2 or 1:3 or 1:4 in Argentina in 2017, though conceivably that
may someday be of interest to some historian of concrete; this
knowledge enhances your capabilities very little.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, consider Becquerel’s observation in
1896 that, even in the dark, potassium uranyl sulfate blackened
photographic plates left nearby, as if they were spontaneously
emitting X-rays, which of course they were.  The observation was
hardly more <em>creative</em> than my note above about the ratio of prices of
different kinds of cement, merely an observation of an unexpected and
unexplained labwork problem in a footnote of a paper.  However, upon
further investigation, this observation answered the mystery of how
the sun could keep burning for billions of years; provided a source of
energy that did not emit CO₂ and required a tiny amount of fuel to a
substantial part of humanity; made it possible to send space probes to
the outer planets; changed the nature of warfare and ended World War
II; revealed the existence of entirely unsuspected types of matter in
the universe; and was a key part of the evidence for special
relativity, which revealed that mass and energy were not two separate
quantities, but the same quantity.</p>
<p>But the consequences of an idea are very situational, whether we’re
talking about its logical consequences (the other propositions that
its truth would entail) or its practical consequences (the results in
the contingent world of its putative truth becoming known).</p>
<p>From the proposition, “Socrates is a man,” we cannot deduce that
Socrates is mortal; nor can we deduce it from the proposition, “All
men are mortal.”  But if either proposition is known, the other has as
a logical consequence the proposition that Socrates is mortal.  So it
is that the logical consequences of an idea depend on what else is
known.</p>
<p>The practical consequences of Hero’s aeolipile were, famously, almost
nil; but under somewhat different historical circumstances,
steam-engines revolutionized industry in the 18th century.  Condorcet
voting made no impact on the USA’s political processes for at least
two centuries, and the USA continues electing incompetent demagogues;
Condorcet voting ensures that Debian’s project leaders are widely
respected.  Oil drilling in the Song dynasty lowered the price of
salt; oil drilling in Pennsylvania made horse-drawn carriages
obsolete.  Cellphones in the US were relegated to executive status
toys until the 2000s; cellphones in India allowed farmers and
fishermen to capture what were previously middlemen’s profits.
Movable type in the Song enabled the preservation of much of the
Chinese literary canon, while movable type in Europe gave birth to the
Reformation, liberalism, and the Westphalian state.  So it is that the
practical consequences of an idea depend on what else is practiced.</p>
<p>Here I’m not concerned with the practical consequences of “big ideas”
that turned out to be false, like the inevitable withering away of the
socialist state or the inevitable triumph of Daesh over “Rome”, but
only ideas whose consequences would be big <em>if true</em>.</p>
<p>So, what ideas in Dercuano could have big consequences, if they turn
out to be correct?  And why?</p>
<h2>Self-replication</h2>
<p>One of the main themes of the last several years of Dercuano has been
“clanking replicators” — more precisely <a href="../topics/self-replication.html">autotrophic programmable
self-replicating 3-D printers</a>, and
especially how to achieve autotrophic replication of the control
computer necessary to control the printer’s actuators.</p>
<p>A workable self-replication design is big, if true, because it totally
upends the principles of economics, in a way which I think will
substantially improve the material well-being of the average human by
reducing opportunities for oppression.  I think the change will be
more important than the Industrial Revolution, more important than the
development of agriculture, possibly more important than fire.  I go
into somewhat more detail on the expected economic effects in
<a href="../notes/exponential-technology-and-capital.html">Exponential technology and capital</a>, <a href="../notes/gardening-machines.html">Gardening machines</a>, and
<a href="../notes/self-replication-changes.html">Self replication changes</a>, and on how to prevent disasters in
<a href="../notes/self-replication-limits.html">Approaches to limiting self-replication</a>, and there’s a fictionalized near-future
scenario of less-radical digital fabrication technology in
<a href="../notes/future-economics.html">2025 manufacturing and economics scenario</a>.</p>
<p>However, on looking at <a href="../notes/tech-predictions.html">Predictions for future technological development (2008)</a>, it’s obvious that my
ability to forecast what the future holds is pretty poor, and strongly
affected by wishful thinking.</p>
<p>The benefit of self-replicating 3-D printers in practice will be
limited by the price of energy, whether that price is measured in a
conventional way with currency or in more fundamental terms of natural
resources, labor power, and capital investment; but energy should
become much more abundant soon due to the uptake of solar photovoltaic
energy — see the section below on the solar energy transition.</p>
<p>The problem of self-replication can be crudely divided into the
problem of designing a <em>cyclic fabrication system</em>, a term I’m
possibly abusing to mean a set of material-processing, part-forming,
and assembly processes which individually consume one another’s
outputs but collectively consume only natural materials; and the
special problem of how to put together a <em>computing system</em> that’s
fast and reliable enough to direct the cyclic fabrication system to
produce the desired product, without requiring exotic materials and
geometries those processes can’t themselves produce.  In particular,
alternatives to the very challenging processes used to fabricate
modern mass-produced semiconductors would be very welcome, keeping in
mind that the economics are very different.</p>
<p>An overview of the whole problem is in <a href="../notes/simplified-computing.html">Simplified computing, down to the level of mining raw materials</a>.</p>
<p>So I explored alternative digital logic technologies in
<a href="../notes/mechanical-computers.html">mechanical computation: with Merkle gates, height fields, and thread</a>, <a href="../notes/mechanical-computers-2.html">Nobody has yet constructed a mechanical universal digital computer</a>, <a href="../notes/topics-2014.html">Ideas to ship in 2014</a>,
<a href="../notes/simple-state-machines.html">Simple state machines</a>, <a href="../notes/wheel-state-machine.html">An extremely simple electromechanical state machine</a>,
<a href="../notes/magnetoresistive-relay.html">Steampunk spintronics: magnetoresistive relay logic?</a>, <a href="../notes/laser-logic.html">Digital logic with lasers, induced X-ray emission, and neutron-induced fission, for femtosecond switching times?</a>, <a href="../notes/planar-state-machine.html">Making a mechanical state machine via sheet cutting</a>,
<a href="../notes/transmission-line-diode-computation.html">Transmission line diode computation</a>, <a href="../notes/diode-logic.html">Diode logic</a>, <a href="../notes/snap-logic.html">Snap logic</a>,
<a href="../notes/hall-effect-logic.html">Hall-effect Wheatstone bridges for impractical steampunk electronic logic gates</a>, <a href="../notes/nonlinear-differential-amplification.html">Nonlinear differential amplification</a>,
<a href="../notes/paper-foil-relays.html">Paper/foil relays</a>, and <a href="../notes/non-inverting-logic.html">Non-inverting logic</a>, largely with an eye to
things that could be built without million-dollar semiconductor fabs.
<a href="../notes/clanking-replicators.html">Clanking replicators</a> touches on this a bit too.</p>
<p>In another direction, though, the topic
<a href="../topics/control.html">control</a> largely talks about
negative-feedback control, including speculative sensor approaches
like <a href="../notes/charge-transfer-servo.html">Charge transfer servo</a>, <a href="../notes/starfield-servo.html">Starfield servo</a>, and
<a href="../notes/v-plotter-servo.html">Servoing a V-plotter with a webcam?</a>, as well as codesigning physical and control systems
for feedback control in <a href="../notes/inverse-filtering-control.html">High-precision control of low-stiffness sytems with bounded-Q resonances</a>; and things like
<a href="../notes/differential-spiral-cam.html">Differential spiral cam</a> cover control systems that aren’t purely
digital, which could reduce the demands on the digital part of the
system.</p>
<p>When it comes to the materials-processing side of things, I’ve done
some overviews like <a href="../notes/automated-fabrication-and-3d-printing-outlook.html">2016 outlook for automated fabrication and 3-D printing</a>
and much of the notes in <a href="../notes/book-in-itself.html">The book written in itself</a>.  I’ve come to the
conclusion that Minecraft is misleading; you start with fire, then
clay.  Any practical <em>terrestrial</em> cyclic fabrication system will
probably begin with clay ceramic.  So in addition to the
<a href="../topics/materials.html">materials</a> category, there’s a
<a href="../topics/ceramic.html">ceramic</a> category, and
<a href="../notes/clay-fabrication-objectives.html">Clay fabrication objectives</a> talks specifically about what to do for
clay, and <a href="../notes/glass-fluxing-3d-printing.html">Flux deposition for 3-D printing in glass and metals</a> and <a href="../notes/flux-deposition.html">3-D printing by flux deposition</a> talk a bit
about some processes that I think might work well.  More broadly, the
<a href="../topics/manufacturing.html">manufacturing</a> category has notes on
many different manufacturing processes, and <a href="../topics/digital-fabrication.html">digital
fabrication</a> has notes on digital
fabrication processes, some existing and some speculative.  <a href="../notes/elastic-metamaterials.html">Elastic metamaterials</a> talks about workarounds for the limitations of
inorganic materials at room temperature, while <a href="../notes/plastic-cutters.html">Plastic cutters</a>
describes a way to minimize the amount of very hard material needed if
cutting is one of the processes in the CFS.</p>
<p>Other notes on existing or possible material-shaping processes include
<a href="../notes/hot-wire-saw.html">Hot wire saw</a>, <a href="../notes/string-cutting-cardboard.html">String cutting cardboard</a>, <a href="../notes/hot-oil-cutter.html">Hot oil cutter</a>,
<a href="../notes/regenerative-fuel-air-cutting.html">Regenerative fuel air cutting</a>, <a href="../notes/zinc-pcbs.html">Laser ablation of zinc or pewter for printed circuit boards</a>, <a href="../notes/filled-fdm.html">Filling hollow FDM things with other materials</a>,
<a href="../notes/hot-air-ice-shaping.html">Hot air ice shaping</a>, <a href="../notes/friction-cutting-plastic.html">Friction-cutting plastic</a>,
<a href="../notes/aluminum-foil-spif.html">Single-point incremental forming of aluminum foil</a>, and <a href="../notes/sun-cutter.html">Sun cutter</a>.  <a href="../notes/freeze-distillation.html">Freeze distillation at 1 Hz</a> is
a possible material-refinement process, and <a href="../notes/spark-particulate-sieve.html">Spark particulate sieve</a>
covers a possible way to make an air or water filter or mesh for
grading solid powders.  <a href="../notes/cold-plasma-oxidation.html">Cold plasma oxidation</a> describes a
process that is commonly used today for surface treatments, but which
I think can also be used for some kinds of cutting and 3-D printing.
And at the end of <a href="../notes/caustics.html">Caustics</a> and in <a href="../notes/arbitrary-light-transfers.html">You can’t construct optical systems with arbitrary light transfers, but you can do some awesome shit</a> there
are some brief speculations on optical-surface fabrication.</p>
<p>Assembly processes like those explored in <a href="../notes/building-blocks.html">Maximal-flexibility designs for printable building blocks</a> are useful
not just for humans, but also potentially for machines, as they can
produce macroscopic tight tolerances using low-precision assembly
processes.  “Voxel printers” is a recent marketing buzzword related to
this.</p>
<p>So, in these areas, what in Dercuano might be an idea with big
consequences, such as enabling autotrophic self-replication?  Because
probably <a href="../notes/zinc-pcbs.html">Laser ablation of zinc or pewter for printed circuit boards</a> isn’t it — I mean, even if it does work, it’s
probably only an incremental improvement.</p>
<p>The family of 3-D printing processes described in <a href="../notes/flux-deposition.html">3-D printing by flux deposition</a> is
applicable to many areas and should extend the range of additive 3-D
printing significantly.  By my count, at present, it discusses some 27
candidate combinations of materials; I have confidence that at least
some of them should work.  If they are tried soon, and work, that
could be a significant advance; presumably if nobody tries them until
2152 it will be a different story.</p>
<p>If one of the numerous alternatives to semiconductor logic mentioned
above works reliably, can work at at least a MHz or so, and can be
fabricated under less demanding conditions, that would also be big, if
true — again, if tried soon enough.  Again, there are enough of them
that it’s almost guaranteed that some of them will work.</p>
<h2>Dirt-cheap precision optics</h2>
<p>Self-replicating machines will probably need optics, at least for
cameras (see the section about sensors below) and quite likely also
for solar furnaces.  But existing approaches to optics fabrication are
very expensive, especially for surfaces far from sphericity.</p>
<p>So there are several notes in Dercuano that propose new
optics-fabrication processes: <a href="../notes/jello-printing.html">Jello printing</a>,
<a href="../notes/caustics.html">Caustics</a>, <a href="../notes/arbitrary-light-transfers.html">You can’t construct optical systems with arbitrary light transfers, but you can do some awesome shit</a>, and
<a href="../notes/glass-fluxing-3d-printing.html">Flux deposition for 3-D printing in glass and metals</a>.  Any of these would be a substantial advance over
existing methods if they work, and this would have significant
consequences for achievable optics, entirely apart from
self-replication.</p>
<h2>Much better sensors</h2>
<p>The <a href="../topics/sensors.html">sensors</a> category right now consists of
five big ideas.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/starfield-servo.html">Starfield servo</a> outlines a way to make some simple physical
objects and less-simple algorithms that would enable a cheap webcam to
become a remote multiple-degree-of-freedom sensor with, in some
dimensions, submicron resolution over a range of a few meters.  If it
works, and I think it will.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/compressed-sensing-microscope.html">Compressed sensing microscope</a> describes the same technique
applied to light microscopy, where it should enable subwavelength
near-field imaging without lenses.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/string-instrument-servo.html">Measuring submicron displacements by pitch bending a slide guitar</a> outlines a totally different way to
measure submicron displacements over a range of a few meters with
inexpensive equipment — electric-guitar pickups, this time, rather
than webcams.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/tinkerers-tricorder.html">The Tinkerer’s Tricorder</a> outlines a variety of hacks to build an
inexpensive LCR meter similar to the popular M328.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/ghettobotics.html">Ghettobotics: making robots out of trash</a> (and category
<a href="../topics/ghettobotics.html">ghettobotics</a>) explores how to build</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a self-sustaining industrial economy that consumes nothing but
 discarded electronics and other trash and produces, with a minimal
 amount of human effort, useful robots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s sort of Self Replication Lite™.</p>
<h2>Archival</h2>
<p>The <a href="../topics/archival.html">archival</a> category covers lots of
possible ways to archive the humans’ knowledge to keep it from being
lost, at many levels of the stack: physical substrates for
information, ways of mass-producing the physical substrates to reduce
chances they will all be destroyed, file-format compatibility, and
archival virtual machines to guarantee file-format compatibility.</p>
<p>So, for example, <a href="../notes/atmospheric-pressure-harvesting-phoenix-egg.html">Atmospheric pressure harvesting phoenix egg</a>
describes a power source that enables you to build a computer that
could continue to run for centuries even while buried, barring too
many hardware failures; <a href="../notes/hypertext-archival-wiki.html">Archival of hypertext with arbitrary interactive programs: a design outline</a> discusses how
to structure interactive hypertext to make archival possible, as do
<a href="../notes/instant-hypertext.html">Instant hypertext</a> and <a href="../notes/blob-computation-notes.html">Kogluktualuk: an operating system based on caching coarse-grained deterministic computations</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/scratch-hologram-polyhedron.html">Some extensions of William Beaty’s scratch holograms</a> describes a way to archive large
amounts of information on inexpensive, durable materials in a way that
the humans can read without needing a working computer, as do <a href="../notes/caustics.html">Caustics</a>, <a href="../notes/laser-etched-archival.html">Data archival on gold leaf or Mylar with DVD-writer lasers or sparks</a>, <a href="../notes/rosetta-opacity-hologram.html">Rosetta opacity hologram</a>, <a href="../notes/holographic-archival.html">Holographic archival</a>, <a href="../notes/piezoelectric-engraving.html">Piezoelectric engraving</a>, <a href="../notes/quadratic-opacity-holograms.html">Quadratic opacity holograms</a>, <a href="../notes/archival-transparencies.html">Archival transparencies</a>, and <a href="../notes/mechano-optical-vector-display.html">A mechano-optical vector display for animation archival</a>.</p>
<p>In between those approaches, there’s the possibility of archiving
large amounts of information in an executable digital form, but
providing a specification for an “archival virtual machine” that can
execute the archived information, as proposed by Raymond Lorie and by
Nguyen and Kay’s “Cuneiform Tablets” paper.  Attacks on this problem
include <a href="../notes/bootstrapping-instruction-set.html">Bootstrapping instruction set</a>, <a href="../notes/vector-vm.html">A simple virtual machine for vector math?</a>, <a href="../notes/lisp-15-forth.html">Lisp 1.5 in a stack bytecode: can we get from machine code to Lisp in 45 lines of code?</a>, <a href="../notes/archival-vm.html">Designing an archival virtual machine</a>, <a href="../notes/xchg-machine.html">XCHG: An Archival Swap Machine</a>, <a href="../notes/uvc-archiving.html">Archival with a universal virtual computer (UVC)</a>, and <a href="../notes/dontmove.html">The Dontmove archival virtual machine</a>.</p>
<p>As an alternative to making time capsules to bridge periods of time
when the humans are uncooperative, we might be able to preserve
history by enlisting their cooperation; <a href="../notes/viral-wiki.html">Viral wiki</a> discusses
one approach to that.</p>
<p>If one or more of these approaches is successful at rescuing the
humans’ knowledge from the Digital Dark Age, that would indeed be Big.
(But it’s not clear how much of that depends on correctness; it
probably depends more on implementation effort.)</p>
<h2>Hessian-free quasi-Newton methods</h2>
<p>In <a href="../notes/adaptive-hill-climbing.html">Robust local search in vector spaces using adaptive step sizes, and thoughts on extending quasi-Newton methods</a> it is claimed that quasi-Newton
methods require maintaining in memory an approximation of the Hessian,
while perhaps a similarly quadratic order of convergence can be
obtained with just the gradient by using Newton–Raphson iteration
along the direction of the gradient, while gradient-descent methods
only have linear convergence.  If all of that is true, which is
unlikely, then it contains a numerical optimization method that is
many orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art in
high-dimensional spaces.</p>
<p>More generally, I think <a href="../topics/optimization.html">mathematical
optimization</a> is a significant candidate
for including in <a href="../notes/powerful-primitives.html">More thoughts on powerful primitives for simplified computer systems architecture</a> as a basic element of
computer systems design; <a href="../notes/%25241-recognizer-diagrams.html">$1 recognizer diagrams</a> gives an
example of how you can use it to replace ad-hoc procedural algorithm
design with something much simpler, which I’m pretty confident will
work.</p>
<h2>High-density fractal heat exchangers</h2>
<p>In <a href="../notes/capillary-heat-exchanger.html">Heat exchangers modeled on retia mirabilia might reach 4 TW/m³</a> it is claimed that a particular
three-dimensional fractal design for a recuperator-type heat exchanger
could provide recuperators with orders of magnitude higher
performance, rivaling that of regenerators.  This could be a crucial
enabling technology for many kinds of thermodynamic machines,
including heat engines (possibly including micro-turbine generators)
and climate-control systems (for example, <a href="../notes/solar-air-conditioner.html">A design sketch of an air conditioner powered by solar thermal power</a>).</p>
<h2>The solar energy transition</h2>
<p>One of the largest changes in the material culture of the humans
during the 21st century will be the transition away from fossil fuels
as their main source of harnessed energy, since the alternative is
global warming that may be sufficient to cause a mass extinction;
right now it looks like they’ll change to solar photovoltaic energy
during the late 2020s.</p>
<p>Since most of the resource cost of producing photovoltaic panels is an
energy cost, but their EROEI is already quite high, this probably
means a rapid exponential growth in the amount of energy available to
be harnessed for human activities.  This will make energy much cheaper
than it’s ever been.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/solar-economics.html">The economics of solar energy</a> is a somewhat dated
overview of the basic issues, which are also discussed in
<a href="../notes/energy-future.html">The future of the human energy market (2014)</a>, <a href="../notes/japan-energy-autarky.html">Japan can achieve energy autarky via solar energy, but not much before 2027</a>, and parts of
<a href="../notes/underground-arcology.html">Notes and calculations on building luxury underground arcologies for whoever wants them</a>.</p>
<p>One of the predictable effects of
abundant marketed energy is cheaper desalination and an end to water
stress.  See <a href="../notes/recycling-distillation.html">A quintuple-acting vacuum cascade to recycle heat for more efficient distillation and desalination</a>, <a href="../notes/fast-sea-salt-evaporator.html">Fast sea salt evaporator</a>, and <a href="../notes/desalination-comment.html">Calculations about desalination in Israel</a>.</p>
<p>Among the more dramatic results of this transition is that, until
there are intercontinental HVDC lines or breakthroughs in
utility-scale energy storage, energy is going to be a lot cheaper
during the day than at night, which means that “demand response” is
going to be really important for taking advantage of the available
energy.  In <a href="../notes/salt-slush-refrigeration.html">Salt slush refrigeration</a> and <a href="../notes/household-thermal-stores.html">Household thermal stores</a> it is discussed how to do household
refrigeration and climate control in a demand-response-friendly way.</p>
<p>It is, however, <em>possible</em> to build enough storage with existing
lithium battery technology to sustain current energy usage levels
during the night; <a href="../notes/lithium-supplies.html">Terrestrial lithium supplies provide adequate energy storage to reach Kardashev Type 1</a> discusses the available
resources, and <a href="../notes/energy-storage-efficiency.html">Energy storage efficiency</a> discusses the
economics in more detail.</p>
<h2>Replacing fractional-reserve banking</h2>
<p>The evils of fractional-reserve banking are a favorite hobbyhorse of
economic cranks and conspiracy theorists.  I don’t think it’s evil,
and moreover I think the standard economic-crank position dramatically
overstates its importance, but it does have some real problems, such as
bank runs, and I think that now we can do better; <a href="../notes/fractional-reserve-banking.html">Replacing fractional-reserve banking with a bond market disintermediated with a blockchain</a> explains how.</p>
<h2>Fast parsing</h2>
<p>A dismaying quantity of current computer software amounts to ways of
caching parsing results because parsing is so slow.  One attack on
this problem is to use a data structure serialization format like
FlatBuffers that permits random access; another is to use faster
parsing algorithms.  In <a href="../notes/profile-guided-parsing.html">Profile-guided parser optimization should enable parsing of gigabytes per second</a> I suggest ways
to increase parsing speeds to a sufficiently high level that much of
that caching code can be thrown away.  They might work.</p>
<h2>Unified caching</h2>
<p>The old joke is that there are three hard problems in computer
science: naming, cache invalidation, and off-by-one errors.</p>
<p>“Cache invalidation” is the process of determining when some cached
result should be updated, which is a very general concept, and
different kinds of caches are ubiquitous in computer systems
architecture, at every layer from RTL design up to container
orchestration, for reasons that include improving throughput,
protecting privacy, tolerating faults, reducing average latency, and
reducing worst-case latency.  The vast majority of complexity in
computer systems does in fact amount to logic that manages different
kinds of caches.</p>
<p>I have found several promising ways to unify many, though not all, of those
caches in a single caching subsystem, which will dramatically simplify
computer systems design at the same time as dramatically improving
performance, if one of them works.</p>
<p>In <a href="../notes/minimal-dependency-system.html">A minimal dependency processing system</a>, <a href="../notes/dependent-data.html">Fault-tolerant in-memory cluster computations using containers; or, SPARK, simplified and made flexible</a>, <a href="../notes/blob-computation-notes.html">Kogluktualuk: an operating system based on caching coarse-grained deterministic computations</a>, <a href="../notes/dependency-bibliography.html">Automatic dependency management</a>, and <a href="../notes/immutable-filesystem.html">Immutability-based filesystems: interfaces, problems, and benefits</a>, I discuss ways to architect computer systems
that simplify this problem; <a href="../notes/transactional-screen-updates.html">Transactional screen updates</a>, <a href="../notes/caching-screen-contents.html">Caching screen contents</a>, and <a href="../notes/cached-soa-desktop.html">Cached SOA desktop</a> focus
specifically on the problem of GUI caching, because it’s a
particularly demanding aspect of the problem that illuminates it from
a particularly useful angle.  In <a href="../notes/memoize-the-stack.html">Memoize the stack</a> and <a href="../notes/hash-cache.html">Amnesic hash tables for stochastically LRU memoization</a> I discuss particular generic algorithms that might be
useful.</p>
<p>More generally, <a href="../topics/caching.html">the topic “caching”</a> covers
many different aspects of the problem.</p>
<h2>Paper/foil relays</h2>
<p>In <a href="../notes/paper-foil-relays.html">Paper/foil relays</a> I describe an electrostatic relay design
that might be feasible at millimeter scale and below to get
reasonably-fast digital logic without any advanced materials
processing.  Unlike electromagnetic relays, these work better at
smaller scales.</p>
<h2>Very efficient 2-D convolution with flat kernels</h2>
<p>In <a href="../notes/convolution-bokeh.html">Real-time bokeh algorithms, and other convolution tricks</a> I explored a number of algorithms for
simulating camera bokeh and discovered a general convolution algorithm
for kernels with a small number of discrete multiplier values which
occur in large contiguous blocks — such as, for example, camera bokeh
kernels for ideal lenses.  If it works, it’s an order of magnitude or
more faster than any previously published algorithm for this problem,
beating even McGraw’s approximate algorithm (although it can handle
cases with spherical aberration, which my algorithm can’t.)</p>
<h2>“Interaction models”</h2>
<p>In <a href="../notes/dehydrating-processes.html">Dehydrating processes and other interaction models</a> I propose a sort of taxonomy of
computer systems architectures based on something called “interaction
models”, which has to do with the relationship between individual
programs and the rest of the system.  It could stand to be sharpened
up a bit.</p>
<h2>Expressive multitouch</h2>
<p>Historically, <a href="../topics/hci.html">human–computer interaction</a> has
mostly been through a keyboard, screen, and mouse.  The screen
provides perhaps 10 megabits per second of output bandwidth, while the
mouse provides perhaps 50 bits per second of input bandwidth (but
limited to about 6 bits per second in practice, according to the
experiments in <a href="../notes/fitts-law-musings.html">Some musings on applying Fitts’s Law to user interface design and data compression</a>), and the keyboard another 15
or so, for a total of about 25 bits per second.  While this vast
disparity hasn’t been much of a limitation for consumption-type
activities like watching the Gangnam Style video or playing Flappy
Bird, it’s a major limitation for using the computer as a means for
creative expression — “magic ink” or a “bicycle for the mind”, in the
phrases of Steve Jobs and Bret Victor.  And it is ultimately through
creating great things, not consuming great things, that the humans can
become great themselves.</p>
<p>Multitouch input devices have dramatically higher input bandwidths
than mice or keyboards, so in theory they might offer dramatically
greater expressive freedom to computer users.  Sadly, despite some
promising prototypes demonstrated by Bret Victor and other
researchers, the humans mostly interact with them by scrolling
vertically with one finger, selecting pre-existing options by tapping
on them, or using an on-screen keyboard.</p>

<p>Maybe you can build a synthesizer kids of all ages can play by humming
into it, and that would be a big hit; that's what <a href="../notes/magic-kazoo.html">The Magic Kazoo: a synthesizer you stick in your mouth</a>
