(4 minutes)</div><p>The traditional way to scan a keyboard is with row and column lines
which are connected through mechanical keyswitches.  This runs into
some trouble with bouncing and contact oxidation, as well as number of
moving parts; a solution is to use variable capacitors instead, where
pressing a key brings two pieces of foil close together, but not into
contact, maybe squishing some plastic foam in between them or
something.  This prevents contact oxidation, since there is no contact
to make sparks, and bouncing, since a small deviation in distance will
produce only a small deviation in capacitance.</p>
<p>It still requires about 2√N wires for N keys, though.  As an
alternative, consider using selective inductive coupling instead of
selective capacitive coupling: pushing a key pushes a ferromagnetic
core through some coils of wire, greatly increasing the inductive
coupling between those wires.</p>
<p>You could imagine, for example, using five “exciter” wires, each of
which runs through 25 air-core coils, arranged in a 5×5 matrix.  Each
of these coils is physically near a coil on a "row" wire, which runs
through the 5 coils on a row for this exciter wire and also the
corresponding 5 coils on the corresponding row for each of the other 4
exciter wires, and a “column” coil, which has a corresponding
column-wise arrangement.  Normally, you have limited inductive
coupling between the wires, but pressing a button inserts a ferrite
core through all three coils, strongly coupling any AC signal on an
exciter wire to a corresponding row and column wire.  The signal is
only weakly coupled to the other row and column wires.  (A factor of
20 difference between coupling with and without the core should be
easily achievable.)</p>
<p>In this cubic arrangement, 15 wires are adequate to scan a 125-key
keyboard, while the traditional matrix arrangement would have needed
23.</p>
<p>But it’s possible to go further with more coils: instead of coupling
just three coils, let the inserted core couple, for example, five
coils.  An exciter current on one of three exciter wires can produce a
current on four other wires, each chosen from a set of three; in this
case, we have 15 wires scanning 243 keys.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to go further with coil polarity: each coil can be
wound in either of two different directions, resulting in an induced
voltage with a phase difference from the exciter voltage.  You could
maybe also use different numbers of turns on different keys, but that
seems like it is going to start to be flaky when the core is
incompletely inserted.  (That's the same reason to prefer using, say,
five wires to scan five columns, rather than four.)</p>
<p>There’s no reason, then, to leave some of the sense wires inactive on
each keystroke.  You could run each sense wire through each key with a
coil in one or the other direction; for example, you could have three
exciter wires which each excite 32 keys, plus five sense wires which
run through all 96 keys, with a coil in one or the other direction,
producing a unique 5-bit binary code for each of the 32 keys for a
given exciter wire.  This gives you 96 keys with only 8 wires.  Since
the codes are balanced, the stray inductive couplings through keys
that are not being pressed should mostly cancel out.</p>
<p>That logic brings us inexorably to preferring only a single exciter
wire, which brings us finally to 128 keys using a single exciter wire
and 7 sense wires: 8 wires for 128 keys, a great improvement over 23.</p>
<p>If the sliding core slides through a hole in a high-permeability
member that curves around to behind the coils, then it can close a
magnetic circuit, reducing the total circuit reluctance by orders of
magnitude, thus increasing the inductive coupling dramatically.</p>
<p>This keyboard design has the great advantage for klutzes like me that
it contains no uninsulated electrical conductors and no tight
clearances, so it should work perfectly well even if it’s, for
example, immersed in salt water or filled with Coca-Cola.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
