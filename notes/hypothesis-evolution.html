(4 minutes)</div><p>David R. MacIver's generative testing system
<a href="https://hypothesis.works/">Hypothesis</a> is an example of a new breed
of "lightweight formal methods" software that I think represents a
significant advance in the state of the programming art.  Hypothesis
works as follows: you state a hypothesis about your system's behavior;
Hypothesis searches for a counterexample by, essentially, fuzzing the
system; and if it finds a counterexample, it "shrinks" it by testing
simpler and simpler examples until it finds one that it cannot
simplify to a simpler counterexample.  (That is, any simplification it
tries results in an example that isn't a counterexample.)  It tells
you the simplest counterexample and records it in an <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database.html">example
database</a>
and then always or nearly always retries it in the future so that
you'll know when you've fixed the bug.</p>
<p>Contrary to 1980s QA dogma, random testing turns out to be an
excellent way to find bugs, and Hypothesis's innovative approach to
shrinking counterexamples is very helpful in getting useful bug
reports.  But you know what would be even more helpful than a single
minimal reproducing test case?  A thorough characterization of the
bug, telling you not only one case where it does happen, but a formal
model of when it does and doesn't happen.</p>
<h2>Evolution of a hypothesis population with adversarial experiment design</h2>
<p>Suppose that your initial hypothesis is that no input sequence for
your calculator program will produce a result that is incorrect by
more than 0.01%, and random testing finds such a result by comparing
against some kind of formal model of arithmetic --- perhaps another
calculator program, one that doesn't have to run fast or use little
memory, or perhaps some kind of sparer model.  The testing has
probably found a large set of cases that produce the correct result
and a smaller set of cases that don't.</p>
<p>The initial hypothesis was that this second set would be empty.  Now
we could generate a set of new hypotheses --- for example, that all
input sequences containing division will produce an incorrect result
--- and test them against the experimental data.  Hypotheses that do a
better job of discriminating the two sets (per bit!) should be
preferred, since the objective is to find a concise hypothesis that
discriminates them perfectly.  Once we have several hypotheses that
discriminate perfectly, or nearly equally well, we can do more
experiments: generate more examples and test them to see what the
result is.  We should prefer to spend our CPU budget on examples that
do a good job of discriminating between our existing hypotheses.  Once
we have more evidence, we can generate more hypotheses, and vice
versa.</p>
<p>The approach is very similar to generative adversarial networks:
hypotheses attempt to evolve to predict the behavior of the system
under test, while experiment design (test-case generation, example
generation) attempts to confuse the existing hypotheses.</p>
<p>What form should the hypotheses take?  There are many possibilities
appropriate to different kinds of examples: predicate-logic
expressions, regular expressions, neural networks, and context-free
grammars, for example.  If an example can be described by some kind of
abstract syntax tree, tree regular expressions can capture interesting
properties of that tree, especially if augmented by predicate-logic
expressions that can examine node properties.  The whole field of
genetic programming can be applied to hypothesis generation.</p>
<p>This may provide a useful way to take advantage of increased CPU power
(see <a href="../notes/testing-introspection.html">The uses of introspection, reflection, and personal supercomputers in software testing</a>).</p>
<h2>Genesis</h2>
<p>This was inspired by <a href="https://gitlab.special-circumstanc.es/hammer/hammer/issues/87">a bug I'm investigating
tonight</a>
which Hypothesis is happily finding seven hundred times a day without
providing much new insight into why it happens.  Of course,
conventional debugging approaches based on inspecting the code are
necessary and sufficient, and I probably should spend some time on
them in this case rather than continuing with black-box testing, but I
thought maybe I could write a simple model of the bug as I did with
<a href="https://gitlab.special-circumstanc.es/hammer/hammer/issues/83">another recent
bug</a> to
exclude it from the testing Hypothesis is doing.  This turned out to
be more difficult than I anticipated, and I got to thinking about what
kind of software would make the process easier.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
