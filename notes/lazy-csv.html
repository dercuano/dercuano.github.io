(6 minutes)</div><p>Objective: store CSV records in minimal memory in Java.  Main
sub-objective: minimize number of heap allocations without costing too
much runtime.</p>
<h2>Brief overview</h2>
<p>A class per CSV format, with field types defined and fields named.
Private booleans to indicate whether the fields have been parsed.
Store CSV line in a char array.  Store comma offsets in int array.
Actually, use the same array for both.  Loop over the line in getters
to set the requested field when it's unknown.  Weakly reference String
fields to avoid either retaining no-longer-used Strings on the heap or
multiplying a String on the heap because it's gotten many times.
Optionally intern the Strings in a (possibly weak) hash table to
handle the common case where many lines have the same value for a
string field.</p>
<h2>In more detail</h2>
<p>From a list of CSV fields and their types, we generate a class
automatically with a getter method for each field.  Instantiating this
class with a line from the file leaves behind only two heap
allocations: one for the instance, and one for an array containing the
line's characters and the offsets into them where each field starts.</p>
<p>We could find the field boundaries lazily; in that case, the method
template code looks something like:</p>
<pre><code>boolean hasQuarter = false;
int quarter = -4242;
int getQuarter() {
    if (hasQuarter) return quarter;
if (knownOffsets &lt; 4) findFieldOffsetsUpTo(4);  // ensure offsets[3] ok
int q = quarter = parseInt(data[3]);
hasQuarter = true;
return q;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Thus when you invoke getQuarter() the usual case will be to check the
boolean, find that it's true, fetch the field, and return it.  The
next most common case will be to fetch <code>knownOffsets</code>, compare it to
4, find that it's not less, and jump ahead to the call to <code>parseInt</code>,
which iterates over the characters from the relevant point in the
character array; hopefully that will get inlined.</p>
<p>It might make more sense to always find the field offsets when the
object is created (i.e. not find them lazily, but rather eagerly),
because that would avoid storing knownOffsets and conditionally
testing it every time a field is parsed.</p>
<h2>Laziness</h2>
<p>Most of the time that I'm processing CSV files, I don't process all
the fields.  I might just want the maximum value of a single field,
for example.</p>
<p>(I'd actually like to be able to avoid doing even character set
conversion, since it's both potentially lossy and also uses up CPU
time for no good reason on fields that I'm not parsing.  Just keep the
data in byte arrays.  This is inconvenient to do in Java.)</p>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>Strings are a little more difficult than primitive types like floats
and doubles, because strings are heap-allocated, so if we're not
careful, they can eat up a lot of memory and also put pressure on the
garbage collector.  There are two strategies to deal with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Weak references.  A weak reference doesn't prevent an object from
being collected by the garbage collector, but if the object hasn't
been garbage-collected yet, it allows you to avoid recreating the
     object.  So the idea is that when we lazily parse a string field, we
store a weak reference to the created String value, and return a
strong reference to it.  As long as the client program holds on to
that String, we can keep returning references to it, but if it
releases it, it becomes fair game for the garbage collector, and then
we may have to recreate it if the program asks for it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interning.  Consider this CSV data from the R distribution:</p>
<pre><code>Name,Country,City,OK,CountryCode
"Argentina (La Plata)",Argentina,"La Plata",1,ar
"Argentina (Mendoza)",Argentina,Mendoza,1,ar
"Australia (Canberra)",Australia,Canberra,1,au
"Australia (Melbourne)",Australia,Melbourne,1,au
</code></pre>
<p>Some of its text columns contain data that will occur only once,
but other columns are drawn from a small set of alternatives, like
the world's countries.  The most effective way to reduce memory
usage for those other columns is to ensure that every CSV object
returning the string "Argentina" from <code>getCountry()</code> is returning
a reference to <em>the same</em> String object, so that it only has to
exist once on the heap.  To achieve this, we'd maintain a hash
table of existing "interned" strings, and when we want to parse
out a field, we check to see if it's already in the table before
we allocate it.</p>
<p>This is a little bit tricky because using the standard Java
HashMap or even Hashtable objects requires that we have already
allocated the String, but a custom hash table implementation
avoids that problem.</p>
<p>The potential problem with interning is that if you intern values
in a unique field, your hash table retains and eventually tenures
strings that will never occur again and do not need to be
retained.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two strategies can be combined to get the best of both worlds: a
custom hash table containing weak references to Strings both avoids
duplicate allocation and avoids retaining data that doesn't need to be
retained.</p>
<p>Weak references are a little less efficient than strong references.  I
don't yet know enough about Java's implementation of them to know
whether they impose an extra cost on the garbage collector (push
notifications) or on the mutator (pull notifications) or both.</p>
<h2>Line parsing</h2>
<p>One very common CSV format, Excel's, allows newlines inside of fields
as long as they are inside of double quotes.  This implies that you
cannot simply walk into Mordor by reading a line and turning it into a
CSV object; you need to involve the CSV-parsing stakeholder earlier in
the process so that it can tell you when you're done parsing a record.
And, as long as it's doing that, it might as well remember where the
fucking commas are.</p>
<h2>External buffers</h2>
<p>Going a little bit further to reducing allocations, copying, and
bounds-checking, we could avoid creating a separate char array for
each CSV object.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
