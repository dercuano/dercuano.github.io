(4 minutes)</div><p>Over the last three nights I’ve written a substantial part of an RPN
calculator in C in order to rebrain a four-function pocket calculator
with a somewhat more reasonable calculating facility.  Last night I
spent about 1½ hours on it; the night before, about an hour; the night
before that, about 3½ hours; for a total of six hours.</p>
<h2>Performance and battery life projections</h2>
<p>The basic user-level functionality mostly works on Linux with a sort
of testing stub implementation of keyboard and screen, although there
are a couple of egregious bugs.  So it should be adequate for
estimating performance.</p>
<p>Using it more or less continuously for 90 seconds, on Linux, compiled
with optimization, executed 340,838 amd64 instructions.  Just starting
and stopping it executed 162,347 instructions, for a difference of
178,491, or almost 2000 instructions per second.  Running it with four
numeric-entry keystrokes executed 169,718 instructions, or 7371
instructions beyond setup and teardown, about 1800 instructions per
keystroke; adding 3 + 4 (four keystrokes) took 168,824 instructions,
or 6477 instructions beyond setup and teardown, about 1600
instructions per keystroke.  If we round this to 2000 amd64
instructions per keystroke or per second, which will probably be more
like 4000 AVR instructions, and if the AVR uses 8 nJ per instruction,
this is about 32 μJ per keystroke (or per second).</p>
<p>My intent here is to replace the calculator’s existing chip with an
AVR or something similar, without replacing its keyboard, LCD, and
maybe even battery.</p>
<p>Some sample batteries:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 300 mAh 1.2 V NiCd AA cell that powers my garden light: 1.3 kJ
  or 11000 hours</li>
<li>a CR2032 lithium coin cell: 240mAh at nominally 3 V but down to 2 V;
  supposedly 192 mWh/g and 3.0 g, so 576 mWh or 691 J or 6000 hours.
  <a href="http://data.energizer.com/pdfs/cr2032.pdf">The datasheet</a> makes it look like it’s reasonable to suck up to
  about 10 or 20 mA out of the battery from time to time without
  unduly hurting its capacity.</li>
<li>a regular non-alkaline 1.5 V AA cell: the Energizer E91 datasheet
  says that it’s 3000 mAh down to 0.8 V if discharged at 25 mA.  If it
  were 1.5 V until the end, that would be 16 kilojoules, which is
  unreasonably high since it would actually be higher energy density
  than the lithium cell; we can probably estimate half that or 8 kJ or
  69000 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>I conclude that the AVR’s active power draw will not consume a
significant amount of battery unless the code gets a lot less
efficient or I program it to do much more complicated things.</p>
<p>However, the AVR can run at 20 MIPS, which requires over 100
milliwatts; at this speed, it could drain some of the batteries
mentioned above in an hour or two.</p>
<h2>Possible features</h2>
<p>So far all I’ve done is a basic four-function calculator, in part
because the keyboard on the thing I want to rebrain is not very large.
But it already offers these features above and beyond a standard
four-function calculator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep expression nesting;</li>
<li>Visual feedback on pending values (by displaying the whole stack, or
  as much of it as will fit);</li>
<li>RPN syntax;</li>
<li>Character-by-character number error correction.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be feasible to also include features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stored programs, including iterative ones;</li>
<li>Named variables;</li>
<li>Measurement units (i.e. dimensional analysis);</li>
<li>Undo;</li>
<li>Persistence;</li>
<li>Vector values with broadcasting.</li>
