<p>I’ve been thinking about doing storage and communication in terms of
small, atomic “grains”, in the range of 64–2048 bytes.  In particular
I was thinking it would be interesting to structure a hypertext system
in terms of such grains, such that you have a few grains on the screen
at a time.  Grains can include “implicit links” to other grains, and
when you change focus to a new grain, the system tries to change the
layout so the implicitly-linked grains are also on the screen, maybe
hiding grains that have been less recently used in order to make room.</p>
<p>On a cellphone screen you have room for somewhere around 2048–4096
characters of text at a time comfortably, and that text may be
referring to equations, graphs, drawings, schematics, computational
models, or other parts of the text.  If we display 8–16 grains at a
time, and each grain has implicit links to the things it refers to (as
well as the previous and next grains in the text), we should be able
to always have all the referents of the focused grain displayed all
the time, as long as that grain doesn’t have more than 7–15 referents,
plus a maximum amount of context.  A simple LRU policy should be
adequate to choose which grains to collapse (or scroll off the top, or
whatever) to make room.</p>
<p>This suggests somewhere on the order of 128 to 512 displayable
characters per textual grain, about a sentence, or a few tens of
thousands of pixels (which, for raster graphics, is one impedance
mismatch between this UI thing and the packet IPC systems I’d been
thinking of).</p>
<p>What would an editor for this structure look like?  If you have a
petabyte of mostly-ASCII text in your hypertext, broken down into
128-character grains, that’s 2³³ grains, so an unambiguous grain
number for each (mutable) grain would require almost exactly 10
decimal digits: “3804448033”.  Using letters shortens the identifiers
to 7–8 characters, or with alternating numbers and letters (as in
Augment, sort of) 8–9.  A 512-byte grain would have room for about 64
grain identifiers in links, so a full B-tree would be about 5 or 6
layers deep.</p>
<p>You could use this structure directly for your editor’s data
structures; ideally you’d have keys to merge two consecutive grains
and break the current grain at a point (into two grains linked with
implicit prev and next links), and maybe some kind of UI affordance to
encourage you to press the split key once a grain got uncomfortably
large.  You really only need to keep in memory the grains that are
currently on the screen; you can flush the updated grains out to a
transaction log (or sandpile?) as they are evicted.  For many
purposes, a search function that only finds strings within a single
grain would be adequate, as searches for strings that cross sentences
are rare, and could perhaps be accommodated with some kind of graph
search.</p>
<p>In addition to implicit links, of course, you’d want explicit links
which only activate when clicked on.</p>
<p>A particularly useful kind of enhancement for such a system would be
the ability to pass parameters to grains which they use to run some
kind of code to render a template for display — potentially the
identifiers of other grains.  In this way, for example, you could
instantiate a pipe flow formula in a hypertext with the particular
parameters of a pipe you were considering.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/hypertext.html">Hypertext</a> (13 notes)
