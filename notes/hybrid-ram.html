(5 minutes)</div><p>There were a couple of papers published in the 2000s about “hybrid
memory” systems with SRAM and phase-change memory (PRAM or PCM-RAM).</p>
<p>Here's the deal.  The standard memory hierarchy for the last 35 years
has been SRAM → DRAM → spinning rust, and now that’s diversifying a
bit, with SRAM → DRAM → NAND Flash → spinning rust, sometimes missing
the spinning-rust part.  Each item in this hierarchy is much more
costly per bit than the next one, but also much faster.  On each of
these, the time to write one byte at a random location, the retail
cost of that location, and the amount of such storage on a typical
small netbook or cellphone, might be, very approximately:</p>
<ul>
<li>SRAM: 0.2 ns, 20 000 nanodollars, 1 MiB</li>
<li>DRAM: 100 ns, 3.5 nanodollars, 4 GiB</li>
<li>NAND Flash: 10 μs (10 000 ns), 0.26 nanodollars, 64 GiB</li>
<li>spinning rust: 8 ms (8 000 000 ns), 0.03 nanodollars, 1000 GB (or 0!)</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll note that the cost of each of these levels of the memory
hierarchy is on the order of US$20.</p>
<p>From this you might think it was some kind of a natural law that
faster memory costs more to make, but the truth is that there's plenty
of memory that's both more costly to make and slower than something in
that list.  It’s just that people stopped making it.  Bubble memory,
core memory, TTL SRAM, acoustic delay lines, punched paper tape,
Williams tubes, magneto-optical disks, even magnetic tape and most
photo and movie film have fallen to this economic logic.</p>
<p>I think this kind of thing is called the “efficient frontier” or
“Pareto frontier”, and it’s a pretty general economic phenomenon:
possible technologies are scattered around some cost/benefit plot
space at random, but the ones that are economically viable are the
ones that have more benefit than everything that’s less costly,
dramatically reducing the diversity of technologies.  When there are
more different benefits to trade off among, more diversity can
survive.</p>
<p>A weird thing about this is that the time to read a byte is the same
in all cases except for NAND Flash, because the process of erasing a
block of NAND is slow, but reading it is potentially quite fast.  In
fact, reading it can be as fast as reading SRAM or DRAM, depending on
how the Flash is designed.  (A friend of mine went off to found a CDN
startup based on this observation a couple of years ago; it’s called
Fastly and now powers a substantial fraction of the internet,
disrupting the business of some internet giants.)</p>
<p>This is not as visible as it could be, because Flash has been slotted
into the existing computing ecosystem as a disk replacement, so to
some extent it’s been limited by the I/O hardware and software built
to support spinning-rust disks.  Also, I think NAND Flash typically
doesn’t support byte reads, just reads of 256-byte blocks.  I have to
investigate further.</p>
<p>This suggests that below a certain ratio of writes to reads, Flash
(and similar technologies like PRAM, FeRAM, CBRAM, and MRAM) can
displace not only some spinning rust but also many applications of
DRAM and SRAM.  This is especially interesting to me because of a
different benefit of nonvolatile technologies like Flash: they use
much, much less power than DRAM.</p>
<p>This is especially important because refreshing DRAM is actually a
major user of computer energy nowadays, especially in mobile devices
where power is so crucial.  If it’s possible to replace a large amount
of DRAM with a larger amount of nonvolatile RAM and a much smaller
amount of SRAM, it would be a huge win.  This is what inspired all
that “Hybrid RAM” research.</p>
<p>Of these alternatives to Flash, PRAM was the first to hit the market,
and so it's the one that inspired the papers on hybrid RAM; it was
only made by Micron, but only from 2012 to 2014.  Intel is trying to
commercialize crosspoint PRAM it developed with Micron under the name
“3D XPoint”.  CBRAM, FeRAM, and MRAM are still available and
mainstream.</p>
<p>A typical PRAM part might have been the Micron NP8P128A13TSM60E, 128
megabits (16 megabytes) of PRAM in a 56-pin package with 115-ns random
reads (using a 25 MHz clock) and 50-ns random writes (using a 50 MHz
clock), which is read performance slightly better than DRAM.  (This
was through an SPI interface.)  It was rated for a million write
cycles, and although its write speed was not as fast as DRAM, it
didn't require a separate slow erase step.  It supported writing or
“programming” (ANDing) at 64-bit granularity.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
