(11 minutes)</div><p>I want to do some median-filtering image processing.  First I want to
do it in a janky way that will work for 2×2, 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5 square
filter kernels, to see if the results I get are reasonable.  Then I
want to see if there’s a better way to do it.</p>
<h2>Median filtering by brute-force sorting</h2>
<p>The janky way is to copy the pixels in the window into a buffer, sort
the buffer, and then take the middle pixel, or like an average of the
two middle pixels.  These buffers are small enough that insertion sort
is probably the way to go.  Insertion-sorting a 5×5 square requires
300 comparisons, though, which is enough to make it slow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A weighted-median filter could be an interesting way to cut down on
resonance artifacts: count the pixels toward the center as having
more weight than they really do.  One way to do this is, after
sorting, you calculate the CDF of the weights in the sorted order,
then take the pixel with the CDF in the center of the range.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Median filtering by quickselect</h2>
<p>Quickselect should be about 6× as fast, but it will still do 50
comparisons, I think.</p>
<p>Subjectively, quickselect on my laptop becomes unbearably slow once
the window is bigger than about 12×12, at which point it’s doing 548
comparisons per window; I think that with the usual partition
algorithm it would be doing 288, but I’m using Lomuto’s algorithm
because it’s simpler.</p>
<h2>Incremental median filtering</h2>
<p>Can you reuse some of the work from one window position to the next
window position?  For example, if you’re shifting a 5×5 square (or
whatever 5-pixel-tall window) to the right by one, can you replace the
original 5 pixels with the new 5 pixels and then move them to the
right place?  On average they’ll move 12 positions, so this involves
about 60 comparisons — probably still slower than quickselect.</p>
<h3>Incremental quickselect</h3>
<p>How about incrementalizing quickselect itself?  Once you’ve found the
median, the buffer is partitioned between less-than-median and
more-than-median items.  If you replace 5 of them, they may need to
move to the other side of the buffer, pushing the median over a
bit — but you don’t a priori know which element from that expanded
side is the new median.  You have to run quickselect on it again,
which is only a speedup of 2, giving you about 50 comparisons.</p>
<h3>Median of medians</h3>
<p>What if you calculate the median of each pixel column and then take
the median of their medians?  This turns out to also save you only
about two thirds of the work, down to half in larger cases.  Here are
how the partitioned items relate to the median of medians, having
sorted the columns by their medians</p>
<pre><code>? ? + + +
? ? + + +
- - = + +
- - - ? ?
- - - ? ?
</code></pre>
<p>That is, one of them is the MOM itself, two medians to the left are
known to be less, and the two to the right are known to be greater.
Transitively, the elements earlier in the left two columns are also
known to be less than the MOM, because they’re less than their own
column median, which is less than the MOM.  Analogous remarks apply to
the right.  But we don’t know anything about the other 8 elements; any
of them could be the overall median.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to get from this to the actual median in an efficient
way, although this might be a good approximation to the actual median.</p>
<h3>Merging for incremental sorting</h3>
<p>What if we sort the new column and then merge it into the sorted order
of the non-deleted pixels in a single pass, 1950s business DP style?
This seems like it is going to be a win; sorting the new column with
insertion sort takes 10 comparisons, and then merging it into the
sorted order takes I think 25, for a total of 35 or so.</p>
<h3>Heaps for incremental quantiles</h3>
<p>What if we maintain a max-heap of the elements in the window that are
less than the median and a min-heap of those that are greater?  We can
replace the old pixels with new pixels and then sift them up or down
as appropriate, possibly shifting elements through the median to keep
the heaps the same size.  Consider the 5×5 case; with 12 elements in
each heap, we will typically sift about 2 steps, for about 10 steps
per window shift.</p>
<p>In the 12×12 case, quickselect needs about 548 comparisons in my
current implementation.  The heap approach would have 72-element
heaps, which would be mostly 6 levels deep, so we would typically sift
each element by about 3 steps, for 36 comparisons.</p>
<h3>Incremental overhead</h3>
<p>The data structure for such an incremental approach probably needs to
be a little more complicated than a simple array of pixel values,
because we need to be able to efficiently find the 5 samples to
replace when we shift.  We need one map from (x, y) pairs to buffer
positions so that we can find the buffer positions to replace and a
second map from buffer positions to (x, y) pairs so that we can access
the actual pixel value or swap the positions of two pixels.  When you
swap two positions, you have to update both arrays.  I don’t know if
there’s a simpler way than this.  This will probably impose enough
update overhead that the crossover from non-incremental quickselect
will come at a larger size than 5×5, since non-incremental quickselect
can work on mere pixel values.</p>
<h3>Histograms</h3>
<p>Suppose you have only, say, 256 different possible color values in the
image.  Then you could represent the distribution of those values in a
window with a histogram, an array of 256 numbers counting the number
of pixels that has each value.  The prefix sum of the histogram, the
empirical CDF, would cross half the size of the window precisely at
the median.</p>
<p>A desirable property of the histogram is that it can be updated
incrementally quite efficiently: to shift a pixel out of the window,
decrement its value in the histogram, and to shift one in, you
increment its value in the histogram.</p>
<p>Instead of maintaining all 256 values, you could maintain a reduced
histogram with, say, 16 buckets; and instead of maintaining just a
count in each bucket, you could maintain an array of the colors that
fell into that bucket.  The bucket at which the empirical CDF crossed
the median would tell you approximately the median, but to find it
precisely, you would need to compute some arbitrary order statistic
over the pixels in the bucket, which could be done with quickselect.
Removing a pixel from the bucket now requires a linear search through
the bucket for its value, but the number of pixels in each bucket is
small.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in the form described above, the ideal number of buckets is
roughly the square root of the window size; for example, for a 12×12
window, perhaps 8 to 16 buckets would be best.  This is because for
each new output pixel we must recalculate the empirical CDF, which
takes time linear in the number of buckets, and then we must calculate
an order statistic inside some bucket, which (under dubious but
probably approximately correct assumptions) takes time inversely
proportional to the number of buckets.</p>
<p>An incremental prefix sum data structure would change the cost
function to favor a larger number of buckets, and the recursive
binary-tree form in particular can update the prefix sum in
logarithmic time; in its sparse form, it reduces to a binary trie over
pixel values in which each trie node knows the total number of
descendants it represents.</p>
<p>(As an alternative to going all the way to the trie structure, you
could use some structure other than a linear list inside each bucket.
But nothing occurs to me that would be a real speedup.)</p>
<p>The bucketing and trie techniques allow the histogram approach to
scale to large color spaces, such as 12-bit grayscale or 24-bit color.</p>
<p>The complexity cost of this technique is nontrivial.  My quickselect
implementation is 18 lines of C and worked the first time; my
prototype trie implementation, which crashes, is 157 lines, although
to be fair it was probably a premature optimization to use node pools
before I had it working at all.</p>
<h2>Rank order filters</h2>
<p>An interesting thing to note about median filtering is that it can be
generalized to a family of quantile filters; you could use any
arbitrary percentile rather than just the 50th percentile.  The result
is a filter that tends to suppress local noise and leaves
uniform-color areas of the image unchanged, but tends to contract or
expand brighter areas according to whether the percentile is less or
greater than 50.  In the extreme cases of 0 and 100, where we take the
minimum or maximum of the neighborhood, the filters are the familiar
erosion and dilation operations from mathematical morphology; the
other percentiles provide a more or less smooth variation between
erosion and dilation, which are the maximally contractive and
expansive filters of the family, respectively, and the most sensitive
to noise, while the median filter itself is neutral between
contraction and expansion and the least sensitive to noise.  With a
25-element kernel with equal weighting, there are 25 quantile filters
in the family, three of which are erosion, median, and dilation.</p>
<p>These are commonly known as “rank order filters” or sometimes
“order-statistic filters”.</p>
<p>The data structures discussed above for median filtering are all
applicable to these more general filters, but their efficiency
properties vary.  The median-of-medians mentioned above provides a
better estimate in any case other than the median case, for example:</p>
<pre><code>? + + + +
? + + + +
? + + + +
- = + + +
- - ? ? ?
</code></pre>
<p>And in the extreme cases of erosion and dilation, it has no unknown
pixels, amounting to the standard decomposition of a rectangular
erosion or dilation kernel into horizontal and vertical kernels.</p>
<p>The trie algorithm, in particular, can effortlessly handle arbitrary
rank-order filters.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
