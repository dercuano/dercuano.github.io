(2 minutes)</div><p>What if we consider the particle-filtering problem from the
perspective of interval arithmetic?  Instead of approximating a
multidimensional prior probability distribution using an exponential
number of particles, we could approximate it with an exponential
number of irregular partitions of the multidimensional space, and then
subdivide the high-probability partitions and fuse the low-probability
ones in order to give each partition equal probability, then do a
Bayesian update.  It seems like this could work and might be more
broadly applicable (and rigorously justifiable) than the Monte-Carlo
approach.</p>
<p>Like raw particle filters, this won’t work well on high-dimensionality
spaces, but perhaps it can, like them, be extended to work on such
spaces.</p>
<p>Interval arithmetic can be used to efficiently calculate that the
posterior probability of being inside a large region of the space is
negligible.</p>
<p>Often, divide-and-conquer algorithms are more efficient when the
division is by three instead of by two — dual-partition Quicksort
being one notable example — and I suspect that might be the case here
too.  If combined with random rather than optimal positioning of the
partition, in particular, it would help with the case where we really
do kind of need particles — where there is a tiny local maximum
probability lost in a large, low-probability partition.  Eventually,
random choice of three-way partitioning will happen to snag the tiny
local maximum between its pincers, and have a chance to track it down
further.</p>
<p>You could store for each partition not only the total probability (or,
equivalently, average probability density) of the partition, but also
the average slope or derivative of the probability density inside of
it.  This would dramatically reduce the error in the estimate of the
PDF that all the intervals comprise together.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
