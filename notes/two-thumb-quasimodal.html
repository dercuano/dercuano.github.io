(11 minutes)</div><p>Most of the time people use their multitouch Android phones with one
or two thumbs, the better to type on the keyboard at the bottom of the
screen.  But the direct-maniplation possibilities of this interaction
paradigm are not very well explored, beyond tapping items to select
them and scrolling vertically.</p>
<p>One-finger scrolling is such a ubiquitous interaction that not
supporting it — or turning it into something incompatible — is going
to be painful.</p>
<p>However, you could quite easily use one-thumb quasimode shifts to
identify an action to be taken using objects selected using the other
thumb.  It’s easy enough to support three or so separate buttons per
thumb, and sliding after touch could select from a pie menu or adjust
two parameters.  Ideally actions like “undo” should require a slide,
so that you can touch the button to see what you can slide to without
fear of invoking an action.  If you have three buttons per thumb and
six slide directions, you have 36 actions or quasimodes available plus
6 further quasimodes.</p>
<p>Also, when you tap an object to select it, you can pop up another
radial menu around the object, which can display detailed properties
of the object; tapping on the menu items can pop up submenus
accessible by dragging, invoke quasimodes, or permit a two-dimensional
continuous adjustment of two parameters.  A common pattern might be to
display the numerical value of an attribute, drag to adjust it
continuously, or tap to enter a new value with the keyboard.  Under
the same six-direction constraint, this allows another 42
object-specific actions.</p>
<p>Initially I thought that perhaps the object context menu should
disappear as soon as your touch ends, so that the menu itself was a
sort of quasimode; but that introduces three problems.  First, you
can’t select from that menu by dragging, because that would interfere
with one-finger scroll, so you have to use your other thumb — but half
the time the menu item you want will be on the wrong side of the menu,
so you have to cross your thumbs, or start over.  Second, part of the
menu is hidden under your thumb, so you can’t see what the options
are.  Third, you give up the possibility of quasimodal menu items on
the object menu.</p>
<p>Here are some example applications.</p>
<h2>Interactive geometry</h2>
<p>(See also <a href="../notes/interactive-geometry.html">Interactive geometry</a>.)</p>
<p>This is a program like KSEG, with points, lines, line segments, rays,
circles, labels, and measurements, computed in a DAG, each possessed
of color and layer properties; layer visibility can be toggled.</p>
<p>Panning, zooming, and rotation of the canvas are conducted using
one-finger drags and two-finger pinches and rotations.  Tapping an
object highlights it and brings up a context menu depending on the
object type; additionally it may bring up other menu options
elsewhere on the canvas.</p>
<p>All operations that you might want to apply to a number of objects at
once or in quick succession, or on no objects, are necessarily on
global quasimode options rather than individual object context menus.</p>
<p>The lower left corner has translucent quasimode buttons for “move”,
“trash”, and “create point”.  Tapping in an empty space flashes the
“create point” quasimode button, since maybe that’s what the user
meant to do.  While that button is held, any taps on the canvas create
points, which are initially selected and thus display their context
menus.  While “trash” is held, skulls and crossbones hover over all
the objects visible on the canvas; tapping them will delete them.
“Move” causes chaos symbols to hover over all the objects visible on
the canvas, and the objects can then be moved with another
finger — indeed, you can move more than one object at a time this way.</p>
<p>While you are holding down one of these buttons, the lower-right
quasimode button cluster is replaced with a popup view of the radial
menu of the button you’re currently on, with a shaded cone connecting
it to that button to clarify that it’s a sort of magnified view.
Dragging up and left on the “trash” button executes “undo”; dragging
down and right executes “redo”.</p>
<p>The lower right corner has a similar set of quasimode buttons.  One is
the “layer” button, which displays the name of the current layer and
whether it is visible.  Holding it invokes a quasimode that moves any
object then tapped to that layer.  Dragging it down and left and up
and right cycle among the layers, with the possibility of cycling
through more than one layer if the motion is extended.  Other drag
directions let you change the name of the layer, toggle its
visibility, or add a new layer (initially labeled with the ten
Heavenly Stems).  Another is the “style” button, which shows the
current style applied to new objects on this layer (or objects moved
to this layer), and which either primarily shows color, line style, or
point style (selectable by dragging up and right or down and left),
and invokes a quasimode to change its focused aspect of objects while
held.  Other drag directions on “style” allow you to change attributes
of the focused aspect of the style (for example, by invoking a modal
popup color selector, or changing the thickness and dash pattern of
lines) or to hide or show labels (itself a quasimode that causes all
objects’ labels to appear in gray, allowing you to tap objects to hide
or show their labels).  The submenus associated with these pop up in
the lower left-hand corner, replacing the left-hand buttons.</p>
<p>The “layer” button in particular allows you to easily create a new
layer with one drag, hold it to point to the objects you want to move
onto it (tapping them a second time to undo the action, perhaps), and
then tap it again to hide them all.  Layers are automatically unhidden
when switching to them.  This provides a conveniently reversible way
to hide objects.</p>
<p>Constructions with two objects as inputs are handled entirely through
object context menus, because you can’t really tell where you’re going
to start a drag — fine selection requires that you be able to correct
your course by dragging after making initial contact.  So, for
example, to create a triangle, you create three points with the point
quasimode, then tap one of them to bring up its context menu.  Holding
the “segment” option on the context menu to activate a segment
quasimode, the other points light up (as would, for example, tangent
points on a circle and perpendicular points on lines and segments) and
you tap two of them, then release “segment”.  Then you tap one of
them, hold its “segment” item, then tap the other and release.  While
the quasimode is active, possible objects to construct appear dimly,
lighting up when your finger is touching in the right place to
construct them.</p>
<p>Other context-menu two-input constructions include perpendicular
through a point, parallel through a point, circle from center and
radius, circle from center and point on circumference, perpendicular
bisector, angle bisector, or line or ray through two points.  Also,
you can constrain or unconstrain a point to lie on some other object,
go to the object’s layer, make the object’s style the current style,
or change the object’s style.</p>
<p>So, for example, circle-from-center-and-radius is just a tap, a hold,
and a tap, and creating two circles with the same radius and different
centers just requires one additional tap, as long as you had the
foresight to start the construction from the radius rather than the
center.  In Geometer’s Sketchpad, each circle is two clicks to select
the inputs and two clicks in a pull-down menu, so you pay eight clicks
for two circles instead of three taps and a hold.</p>
<p>However, intersection points, midpoints, and points constrained to an
object are constructed using the point quasimode — you just drag your
finger around until you get the option you want, displayed in a
callout.</p>
<p>Constructions of more than two inputs use a different interface.  The
third lower-right button opens a cartoon of the construction on top of
the canvas; you then specify correspondences between the
formal-parameter objects in the cartoon and the corresponding actual
parameters in your sketch by touching them at the same
time — effectively the formal parameter objects are quasimodal.  Once
only one formal parameter remains unspecified, you can see previews
for possible formal-parameter values as you drag around the canvas.</p>
<p>Dragging on that constructions button scrolls around a universe of
possible constructions to try.</p>
<p>A drawer that can be slid out from the right side with a tab contains
a step-by-step textual description of the sketch, and objects can be
selected in either the canvas or the text.</p>
<p>Other miscellanea include creating text objects, creating formulas,
creating loci, creating new constructions (including by refactoring),
entropy-minimizing point coordinates via implicit slow snaps, and file
management.</p>
<p>Whenever an object is selected, its parents and children are also
highlighted in different colors.</p>
<h3>Prototype plan</h3>
<p>To see if that’s a good idea, I need to write a prototype, and DHTML
is the easiest way to do that.  But right now I don’t have hardware
that I can usefully get multitouch events from in DHTML: I can’t find
my new iPhone, my modernish Android phone has a power fault, I don’t
have a charger for my old iPhone (and I don’t know if it will charge),
and although my ancient Android phone delivers touch events in its
browser, it seems to unavoidably collapse into pinch-zoom mode as soon
as there’s more than one touch on the display at once.</p>
<p>So I’m going to start by prototyping on my laptop, using the keyboard
for the quasimodes.</p>
<p>The very most minimal functionality that can possibly be interesting
to look at at all is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making points.</li>
<li>Making lines between those points.</li>
<li>Moving the points.</li>
