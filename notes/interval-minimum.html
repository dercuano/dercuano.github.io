<p>(Probably a duplicate of <a href="../notes/summed-area-tables.html">a logarithmic-time alternative to summed-area tables for reducing arbitrary semigroup operations over arbitrary ranges (a generalization of RMQ segment trees)</a>.)</p>
<p>I don’t have much time to write this, so I may end up sending out a
version that’s somewhat telegraphic.</p>
<p>There’s an alternative to summed-area tables with a small, linear
space cost and linear construction time providing worst-case
logarithmic-time reduction over arbitrary intervals over arbitrary
semigroups.</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<h3>Summed-area tables</h3>
<p>Franklin Crow’s 1984 paper, “Summed-area tables for texture mapping”
calls them “summed-area tables”, and Graphics Gems called them “sum
tables”.  More recently, they’re known as “integral images”.  In the
one-dimensional case, they allow you to calculate the sum of values in
an arbitrary interval in constant time by subtracting the values from
the summed-area table at the ends of the interval: sum(f[m:n]) =
-sat(f)[m] + sat(f)[n], where sat(f)[i] = sum(f[0:i]), for a suitably
low value of 0.</p>
<h4>Decimation</h4>
<p>As an extension, you can use a decimated summed-area table, with
values only present every (e.g.) 16th or 32nd index, without losing
the constant-time property.  You may have to consult the original
array, but only up to 2*(16-1) or 2*(32-1) values of it, which is
constant.  This dramatically reduces the space cost of the technique.</p>
<h4>Generalization over operations</h4>
<p>You can generalize the sum-table idea beyond integer addition?
Clearly they work fine for mod-N integer addition, vector addition,
and the combination of the two (e.g. XOR).  I think your operation
only needs the properties of associativity and left inverse, and to
preserve the constant-time property, you need the constraint that the
operation must be computable in constant time.</p>
<p>(For the N-dimensional case, I think you may also need commutativity.)</p>
<h3>A logarithmic-time alternative to sum tables for semigroups</h3>
<p>But what do you do if you’re interested in an operation that doesn’t
have a left inverse?  For example, the “minimum” operation (or in
general the meet operation of a meet-semilattice) can’t have inverses
of elements, because it’s idempotent, so you can’t compute it with a
sum table.</p>
<p>But you <em>can</em> compute it in logarithmic time with a tree.  Let</p>
<pre><code>mint(f, m, n) = nil if m == n
              = (m, n, min(f[m:n]), mint(f, m, floor((m+n)/2)),
                                    mint(f, floor((m+n)/2), n)) otherwise
</code></pre>
<p>Now if you precompute mint(f, 0, f.length), which is a balanced binary
tree with 2*f.length - 1 nodes, not counting the nils, and which can
be computed in linear time, you can compute min(f[m:n]) for arbitrary
m, n in logarithmic time given that tree.  That algorithm is
straightforward.</p>
<p>This algorithm applies to any semigroup over the elements; it can be
used to calculate sums as easily as minima, although more slowly than
using a sum table.</p>
<h4>Space reduction: decimation</h4>
<p>Analogously to sum tables, if your leaf nodes represent spans of some
16 or 32 elements instead of 1, you get a dramatic space reduction
without losing the logarithmic-time asymptotic performance.</p>
<h4>Space reduction: array storage</h4>
<p>The contents of the tree produced by the mint() function depends only
on m and n, except for the min(f[m:n]); and if f.length is a power of
2, it is a full binary tree.  A full binary tree can be stored, as in
the classic binary heap, in an array a such that the children of the
element at a[i] are at a[2i+1] and a[2i+2] (zero-based).  So you can
store the minima for the tree in an array (without decimation, of
2*f.length - 1 elements) rather than allocating numerous nodes on the
heap.</p>
<p>This requires a slight enhancement to the lookup algorithm to
recompute the same (m, n) as the construction algorithm, rather than
looking them up in the tree.</p>
<h4>Constant-space bottom-up construction</h4>
<p>If you construct the tree recursively, in addition to the O(N) space
for the results, you need O(log N) stack space.  But that is not
necessary.  If you’re using the array storage suggested in the
previous section, you can fill the array starting from the end, so
that the only auxiliary storage you need for the construction process
is a simple counter.</p>
<h4>Enhancement: indices</h4>
<p>In the case where the semigroup operation is exactly minimum or
maximum over a totally ordered set, the value stored in each treenode
will be the value of one of the items in the original array.  In this
case it is strictly more powerful to store the index of that item
rather than its value.  This may be useful if you have some other data
that are indexed the same way.</p>
<h4>N-dimensional case</h4>
<p>This generalizes easily to k-d trees, although the efficiency
guarantees are not as good.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
