(1 minute)</div><p>Suppose you have an FSM connected to a delay line.  There should be a
pretty simple transition table to make it into a counter; it just
needs to somehow set its carry bit when it wraps around to the
beginning again.  One solution is for the FSM’s initial state to be
such that it emits a “start mark” or “framing mark” which doesn’t
otherwise appear in the initial state of the delay line.</p>
<p>Probably the simplest such scheme is the Internet-0 encoding scheme:
11 is the framing mark, 01 represents a binary 1, and 10 represents a
binary 0 (or vice versa), and 00 is unused (“blank tape” or no
transmission).  This particular scheme can even work with odd-length
delay lines, since once the counter sees a correctly-framed 00, it can
go into a mode where it searches for the framing mark even at odd
bits.</p>
<p>This FSM, as a Mealy machine, has seven states: carrying, waiting to
carry, copying, waiting to copy, searching, framing mark 1 (the
initial state), and framing mark 2.  Its transition and output table
is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>|                     | 0 | 1 |
| A: carrying         |   |   |
| B: waiting to carry |   |   |
| C: copying          |   |   |
| D: waiting to copy  |   |   |
| E: searching        |   |   |
| F: framing mark 1   |   |   |
| G: framing mark 2   |   |   |
