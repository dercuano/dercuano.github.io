(10 minutes)</div><p>Basically, homemade minipimer mayonnaise is a fucking miracle.  From
200 mℓ of oil (US$0.18), an egg (AR$35 for half a dozen, US$0.15 per
egg), 20 mℓ of lemon juice (AR$100 for 500 mℓ, I think, so US$0.10) and
a pinch of salt (say US$0.01), you get about 300 g of mayonnaise
customized to taste.  Not counting depreciation on the minipimer and
the 40 kJ of electrical energy, that’s 44¢, and the whole process
takes under 4 minutes, including getting the ingredients out and
washing the dishes.  And the result keeps even without refrigeration,
though beware of circumstances where it can get diluted with water,
lowering the acidity and salinity to levels where bacteria and fungi
can grow.</p>
<p>The recipe is, as explained in that Twisted Sister song, <a href="https://youtu.be/35PocLHx534">huevos con
aceite y limón</a>.  In more detail:</p>

<h2>Notes from my experience</h2>
<p>Since noting the above, I’ve made mayonnaise about 20 times.  My
experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a 600-watt minipimer (“immersion blender”) there is very little
  you can do to keep the mayonnaise from emulsifying properly in less
  than a minute; I managed to do it once by not having enough egg in
  there, so I added another egg.</li>
<li>This is true regardless of how much or how little oil you are
  including or how warm or cold anything is.</li>
<li>Alioli — aioli in French — is fucking amazing.  Including a clove of raw
  garlic — without bothering to mince it, because the minipimer takes
  care of that — makes a magical gel of deliciousness that can be
  applied to any food.</li>
<li>Lower-power minipimers are less reliable at emulsification and much
  slower, so if you’re using one of those you may actually need to
  wait to add some of the oil.  You still don’t need to do the thing
  where you carefully add the oil in a tiny trickle to keep it from
  separating out, which apparently you do have to do if you’re mixing
  it with a fork or a whisk.  The longer time probably produces more
  wear and tear on the minipimer.</li>
<li>A bit of raw onion in the mayonnaise instead of garlic produces a
  result very much like sour cream with onion.</li>
<li>Both vinegar and bottled lemon juice are fine, but I like the flavor
  of the lemon juice a bit better.</li>
<li>The mayonnaise thus made separates a bit over the course of a few
  days if not eaten first, forming a sort of hardened grease on the
  top and up the sides of the mixing bowl.</li>
<li>I’ve been using bargain-basement sunflower/soy oil mix (AR$33 per
  900 mℓ last time I bought it, although then US$1 was AR$41, and now
  US$1 is AR$45) and can’t tell the difference from pure sunflower
  oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m using cut-off bottoms of Coke bottles as mixing bowls.  These are
somewhat annoying to actually get the mayonnaise out of, because of
the five smallish projections around the bottom, but I suspect those
help a bit with the mixing part, by virtue of allowing the minipimer
to spin very close to the bottom without actually touching it.
Miraculously, neither of the minipimers I’ve used for this so far have
the geometry to cut up the bottle bottom.</p>
<p>Minipimers are also much easier to wash than whisks are; you stick the
end of the minipimer into a bowl of water and turn it on.  The
emulsion nature of mayonnaise helps here, dispersing the oil in small
micelles.  The PET of the Coke bottle is somewhat less accommodating;
although the oil doesn’t soak into it the way it does with
polyethylene and polypropylene, really getting it off the plastic
requires copious detergent and hard work with a sponge.  Fortunately,
this is unnecessary if you just rinse the mixing bowl with water and
then make more mayonnaise in it as soon as you run out.</p>
<p>So far I haven’t gotten salmonella from my homemade mayonnaise.
Wikipedia tells me that large salmonella outbreaks in mayonnaise are
invariably associated with inadequate acidity, with pH of 5 or even 6,
while pH in the 3.6 to 4.1 range prevents spoilage.  Unfortunately I
don’t have litmus paper handy, so I don’t know what the pH of my
mayonnaise is, and I don’t carefully measure the acid as I add it.</p>
<p>You can turn the mayonnaise into a super lazy egg salad by adding a
couple of boiled eggs, and optionally black or white pepper and a
slice of raw onion, and chopping for just two to ten seconds with the
same minipimer before washing it.  If you have the eggs boiled
beforehand, this is an excellent antidote to the urge for expensive
convenience food.</p>
<h3>Failed mayonnaise rescue by defecation</h3>
<p>A couple of times using an underpowered minipimer I’ve failed to get
the mayonnaise to mayon at first.  In each case, after failing to
solve the problem by adding more egg yolks, I let it sit covered in
the fridge for an hour or two, and a substantial amount of bright
yellow oil separated at the top; after pouring this off, it was
relatively easy to get the less-oily remainder to gel, and it could
then assimilate the oil that had been poured off.  I suspect that
what’s happening is that the egg is being reduced to separated
droplets floating in the oil, and further stirring is not effective at
getting them to join up, though perhaps it makes them smaller, and
certainly it keeps them from settling.</p>
<p>This process of separating immiscible liquids, or a liquid and a
solid, by allowing the heavier one to settle out, is known as
“decantation” or “defecation”.  Do not attempt to instead separate the
mayonnaise after digesting it.</p>
<p>Presumably the aqueous phase of a successful mayonnaise is continuous,
and that is the difference; I don’t know if its oil phase is
discontinuous, separated into droplets, or if the two phases form
interpenetrating open-cell foams.  The aqueous phase of the failed
mayonnaises is definitely discontinuous, though, because tiny droplets
of it remain suspended in the oil after it separates.</p>
<h3>Is it healthy?</h3>
<p>Aside from the concerns about salmonella, mayonnaise has a lot of
calories; it’s more than 70% pure fat.  Eating fat is probably good
for you (the late-20th-century conventional wisdom to the contrary has
been shown to be false) but eating calorically dense foods is not.  So
it should be used as an ingredient in a more diverse food, such as a
salad, not eaten by itself.  Commercial mayonnaise is unappetizing
enough that you have to be Michael Hart (peace be upon his blessed
soul) to eat it by itself, but this stuff is tasty enough that I'm at
risk of just eating it with a spoon.</p>
<p>If you’re eating a low-carbohydrate diet, perhaps a ketogenic diet,
maybe you shouldn’t eat commercial mayonnaise, because it invariably
contains modified food starch as a thickener.  But real mayonnaise,
made from egg, oil, and either lemon juice or vinegar, contains only
traces of carbohydrates; lemon juice is about 6% carbohydrates
(according to the bottle I have here) and the mayonnaise is about 5%
lemon juice, so each 100 g of mayonnaise might contain 300 mg of
carbohydrates from the lemon juice.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/household.html">Household management and home economics</a> (44 notes)
