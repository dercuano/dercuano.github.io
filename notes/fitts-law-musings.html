<p>Fitts’s Law says MT = a + b lg(1 + D/W): we divide the distance to the
center of the target by its width along the line of motion, add 1,
take the logarithm (in base 2, by convention), multiply by some
parameter b, and add some other parameter a, to get the movement time.</p>
<p>As described in <a href="../notes/dercuano-drawings.html">Dercuano drawings</a>, I want to use Fitts’s Law to
design a bandwidth-limited drawing system for Dercuano.  I can type
about 72 bits per second if we count ASCII, or 24 bits per second if
we use the gzipped weight of the text, or 45 bits per second if we
consider the keyboard keys as being 5 bits each.  Since I often have
to stop and think while I’m typing, probably the bit rate for drawing
should be somewhere in the neighborhood — maybe 5 bits per second, or
maybe 500, but probably not 1000 or 10000.  That is, some part of my
mouse movements is basically random, and could be rounded off with no
loss of intentional information.  Fitts’s Law can perhaps tell me what
part.</p>
<p>We know from Fitts’s Law that the imprecision of movement in a given
time is proportionally greater when larger distances are being
covered, although this flattens out for movements comparable to the
target size.  Solving for D/W as a function of MT, a, and b:</p>
<pre><code>(MT - a)/b = lg(1 + D/W)
2**((MT - a)/b) = 1 + D/W
2**((MT - a)/b) - 1 = D/W
</code></pre>
<p>So, when MT = a, the start/stop time, D/W must be zero; when
MT = a + b/2, you can reach targets about 0.414 of their width from
your starting point (this is a bit silly, since you start inside of
them!); when MT = a + b, you can reach targets 1W away (requiring you
to move between 0.5 and 1.5 times their width in their direction);
when MT = a + 2b, you can reach targets 3W away; when MT = a + 3b, you
can reach targets 7W away; when MT = a + 4b, you can reach targets 15W
away; and so on.</p>
<h2>What does Fitts’s Law suggest about the channel bit rate?</h2>
<p>Consider a pixel-resolution pointing device, and suppose your starting
point is surrounded by approximate circles of circular target buttons,
each of radius 15W, thus containing about 47 targets each.  If you
move your mouse to the right, you cross the first of 8 circles of
2-pixel targets after 30 pixels, and there are 8 such circles, the
last ending before pixel 46.  Pixels 46 to 61 are divided into
three-pixel-wide targets, pixels 61 to 77 into 4-pixel-wide targets,
pixels 77 to 92 into 5-pixel-wide targets, and so on.  By the time we
reach pixel 400 we have crossed 44 targets and entered a 45th; Fitts’s
Law suggests that we should have been able to select any of these 44
targets in time a + 4b.  Moreover, since each of the circles has 47
targets arranged around it, we had a total of 2068 targets, all
selectable in that same time: 11 bits of target.  If b ≫ a (let’s
assume that for now), then that’s 2.8 bits per b.</p>
<p>Now consider filling the same area with smaller targets, each of
radius 31W, thus fitting 97 round targets around each concentric
circle, and also about twice as many circles: 89 circles, say.  So we
have 8633 possible targets, which makes 13 bits, selectable in time
a + 5b, which is only 2.6 bits per b.</p>
<p>This trend suggests that the highest possible bit rate would come from
packing circles with the lowest possible D/W, which would be about 1.
So your 2-pixel target is pixels 1 and 2, a 3-pixel target is pixels
2:5, a 9-pixel target is pixels 5:14, a 28-pixel target is pixels
14:42, an 84-pixel target is pixels 42:126, and a 252-pixel target is
pixels 126:378, so in the same area as before, you have six “circles”,
each of which can contain about six targets.  (You could probably do a
bit better by staggering the circles to move the centers of targets
further apart, but the improvement should be small.)  So you have
about 36 targets, 5 bits, selectable in time a + b, which would be 5
bits per b if a were small.  Our rationale for assuming a is small has
gone away, since we’re no longer looking at the limit of large D/W,
but it still seems likely that this is the best case.</p>
<p>Still, that’s a much less variable bit rate than I was intuiting.  In
this tautochronic arrangement, every doubling of D/W adds 2 bits to
the information content of the selection and adds b to the time.  So
if a = 1.5b (or perhaps a bit more, if the denser arrangements I
mentioned pan out), the bit rate would stay fixed at 2 bits per b.</p>
<p>Of course, if unboundedly far-off targets are allowed, there is no
limit to the bit rate.  Instead of six “circles”, you could have
12 “circles” of targets (the largest having targets 183708 pixels
wide) or 24 (the largest having targets 97629963228 pixels
wide — about 16000 km), and that would give you almost 7 bits per
selection, which — according to Fitts’s Law — would still take the
same amount of time, MT = a + b.  The number of bits per constant-time
selection grows as log log D, though, and as you can see, that’s
effectively constant.  Also I am going to go out on a limb here: I
don’t think you can actually move your mouse cursor 16000 km in the
same time you can move it 84 pixels, even if your screen <em>does</em> scroll
and anywhere from 9200 km to 28000 km <em>would</em> be close enough.</p>
<p>A different reductio ad absurdum of Fitts’s Law (in this basic form)
is that it has no term for the width of the target in the
circumferential direction of motion.  Above, I’ve considered the case
where the width of the target is the same in all dimensions, but
consider crossing-based user interfaces; in these, to activate a
target, instead of moving the mouse to within a target and clicking on
it, you just need to move the mouse across the border of the target,
possibly without even stopping.  Effectively, the “target” has
infinite width in the direction of motion, which means D/W = 0 and MT
= a + lg (1 + 0) = a + lg 1 = a + 0 = a.  This would imply a constant
time to select one of many targets that can be crossed in a straight
line from where your mouse starts, regardless of how many such targets
there are and thus how precise your angle has to be to hit the target
you want, and also regardless of how far away the targets are from the
mouse’s starting point.  (The same argument would suggest that the
time to select a known item from a pie menu is independent of the
number of items in the menu if its inner and outer radii remain
unchanged.)</p>
<h2>Estimating the parameters from my handwriting</h2>
<p>My handwriting is about 13 words per minute, which is roughly one
letter per second.  Each letter could be reasonably approximated by a
couple of cubic Bézier curves, each of whose control points has an
error in the neighborhood of, eyeballing, 10% of the distance from the
previous control point, so perhaps D/W is about 7.  Given the guess of
8 control points per letter and thus 125 ms per control point, this
suggests that a and b are in the neighborhood of 30 milliseconds each;
this in turn suggests a bit rate on the order of 64 bits per second
for my handwriting.  I write about half as fast with the mouse, so
perhaps 32 bits per second.</p>
<p>This suggests that it should be safe to round drawing movement
coordinates to about 64 bits per second.  For explicit placement of
anchor points with separate clicks, this is straightforward to apply:
if the time since the last click is 250 ms, round it to 8 bits each of
x and y for a total of 16 bits, but if it was 283 ms, use 9 bits each,
and at 313 ms, use 10 bits each, etc.  (4 Hz is about as fast as I can
click with a mouse.)</p>
<p>I’ve rigged up a primitive experiment with the mouse and some SVG and
JS to present me some circles to click on, and the <a href="../liabilities/fitts-data-cleaned.csv">data from the
experiment</a> is surprising.
Fitts’s Law does seem to hold, broadly speaking, but there’s a lot of
variability, like, a lot of residuals are on the order of half of the
height of the trend line — variability gets bigger as task time gets
bigger, maybe because I have a hard time hitting the tiny circles with
the mouse or sometimes even seeing them.  The residuals are far from
normally distributed.  A linear regression on 417 data points finds
<em>a</em> = 220 ms, <em>b</em> = 340 ms, <em>R</em>² = 0.7; this means clicking on circles
that appeared centered under the mouse took about 220 ms; circles
whose center was one diameter away from the mouse took about 560 ms;
circles whose center was three diameters away took about 900 ms;
circles whose center was seven diameters away took about 1200 ms; and
so on.  What I did in R was this:</p>
<pre><code>fitts.data &lt;- read.csv('fitts-data-cleaned.csv')
fitts.data$fitts &lt;- log(1 + fitts.data$D / fitts.data$W) / log(2)
model &lt;- lm(MT ~ fitts, fitts.data)
plot(fitts.data)
plot(model)
plot(MT ~ fitts, fitts.data)
abline(model)
summary(model)
</code></pre>
<p>This is dramatically slower than I had anticipated!  It suggests that
my bit rate at moving the mouse to an area on the screen is closer to
6 bits per second than to the 32 bits per second I was hoping for or
the 64 bits per second I get with a ballpoint pen.</p>
<p>(Further examination of the data suggests that the biggest residuals
do come from the smallest circles, but in both upward and downward
direction, so removing the smallest circles actually reduces the <em>R</em>²
of the regression.  <em>The Grammar of Graphics</em> §9.1.4.1 suggests
applying a projective transformation to the data (MT, fitts) → (1/MT,
fitts/MT) in order to eliminate its egregious heteroskedasticity, but
I haven’t tried that.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, a better workflow may be to sketch a whole freehand
curve with the mouse or other input device, and then optimize an
overall representation for it, in terms of lines, splines, and
corners.  I just opened Inkscape and scrawled “On the other hand, a
better workflow may be to” in it, which took 163 seconds (4 wpm, a
third of my speed with a pencil or ballpoint) and involved 37 glyphs
(say this would require 300 control points), with rather larger errors
(say D/W ≈ 3).  This is about two control points per second with about
3b entry time (implying about 6 bits per control point, 12 bits per
second) each, which is about 4 times worse than the estimate above
from my normal handwriting, but still twice as good as the estimate
from my SVG experiment.</p>
<p>Going further in that direction, maybe the right approach is to sketch
things on paper, photograph them, scan in the photographs, and
construct low-Kolmogorov-complexity approximations of the images.  If
I’m really getting 6–12 baud with the mouse, 45 baud with the
keyboard, and 64 baud with a ballpoint pen, it would seem to make
sense to just use the pen!  Otherwise I could easily end up spending
an hour and a half on a sketch that could have taken ten minutes — or,
more likely, not making the sketch at all.</p>
<h2>Vector encoding</h2>
<p>If the objective is not to impede drawing but to minimize the Dercuano
download size, it isn’t sufficient to avoid mixing in a bunch of
unintentional quantization noise; we also need to think about how to
represent the displacement vectors that make up the drawing as bits.</p>
<h3>8 bits per coordinate?  What, with fixed fields?</h3>
<p>Perhaps this could be a floating-point format with a sign bit, 2 bits
of exponent (2⁰, 2¹, 2², or 2³ pixels per count), and a 5-bit
mantissa.  Exponent of 0 would be “denormalized” pixel counts: 0 is 0,
1 is 1, 2 is 2, etc., up to 31 is 31, but exponent of 1 and up would
have an implicit leading 1, so 0x20 would be 32, 0x21 34, 0x22 36,
etc., up to 0x3f, which would be 32+2×31 = 94, and then the exponent
of 2 would similarly start at 0x40 for 64 and go up by fours: 0x41 for
68, etc.  0x7f in that scheme ends up being 256+8×31 = 504 pixels.</p>
<h3>Truncated Golomb coding?</h3>
<p>Golomb coding is a lossless encoding that concatenates an unary bucket
identifier with a binary within-bucket index; it’s the optimal prefix
code for the geometric distribution.  The buckets are (the intervals
between) multiples of the bucket size parameter M; to encode a
nonnegative integer, you do an integer division by M, encode the
integer quotient q in unary (as, say, a series of q-1 1s followed by a
0), and then append the binary encoding of the remainder, using the
number of bits necessary to encode all nonnegative integers less than
M.  That is, the remainder is a fixed-length field for a given
parameter M.</p>
<p>Suppose that we use M = 64 and truncate the result to fit in 7 bits.
(We can, again, encode the sign bit separately.)  Numbers less than 64
are encoded in binary as 0xx xxxx; numbers 64:128 are encoded with
only 5 significant bits, thus rounding to even pixels, as 10x xxxx;
numbers 128:192 are encoded with 4 significant bits as 110 xxxx, thus
rounding to every fourth pixel; 192:256 are 111 0xxx, rounding to
every 8th pixel; and so on until 111 1110 represents 384 and 111 1111
represents 448.  Thus we have progressively worse resolution for large
moves, rather than the fixed resolution Fitts’s Law would suggest.</p>
<p>(You could omit the initial 1 of the unary code in this fixed-width
context, but that doesn’t overcome the overall problem.)</p>
<h3>How about truncated Elias delta or gamma coding?</h3>
<p>Gamma coding is a prefix code that represents an arbitrary positive
integer as an excess-1 unary bit count (traditionally written as a
number of leading zeroes, with no leading zeroes meaning the one-bit
number 1) and then the number itself; so 5 = 101₂, is written as 00101.
Delta coding is “flatter”; it uses gamma coding to encode the number
of bits in the number and then appends the number (without the leading
1), so the 5-bit number 10101₂ = 21₁₀ is written as 001010101.</p>
<p>127₁₀ = 111'1111₂ is the longest number whose bit count fits in three
bits, and so it is delta-coded as 00'111'11'1111, or 001 1111 1111 in
the traditional 4-bit groups.  All larger numbers, and no smaller
numbers, have three zeroes at the beginning.  So the probability
distribution for which delta coding is optimal is one where numbers
larger than 127 are ⅛ of the total universe of numbers, numbers larger
than 65'535 are half of that, numbers larger than 4'294'967'296 half
of that (one out of every 32 numbers), numbers larger than
18'446'744'073'709'551'616 half of that (one out of every 64 numbers),
and so on.</p>
<p>1 is delta-coded as 1: zero 0s indicating a 1-bit length field, which
is 1, followed by the number in binary, omitting its leading 1, which
leaves the empty string.  2 is delta-coded as 0100, and 3 as 0101, and
that’s all the 4-bit numbers.  Then 4 is delta-coded as 01100, five
bits, and thus up to 01111, 7.  That’s everything that begins with 01,
10, or 11, thus implicitly ¾ of all numbers, and then we’re into the
001 territory that takes us all the way to 127.</p>
<p>So even though Elias delta coding is able to handle very large numbers
with moderate overhead over fixed-width binary (unlike Elias gamma
coding, which uses double), it squanders ¾ of the probability mass on
numbers 1 to 7 inclusive, which is not helpful for our goal of
representing coordinate pairs at 64 bits per second, which almost
guarantees that often we’ll want to encode relative coordinates in 4
or 5 bits.</p>
<h3>Jointly encoding pairs</h3>
<p>The Elias coding discussion didn’t even consider where we’re going to
stuff the multiplier implied by the rounding, the one we earlier
described as the exponent field of a floating-point format.</p>
<p>Fitts’s Law suggests that the multiplier is almost independent of the
resolution of the final result, in the sense that you could reasonably
want 4-bit precision with a multiplier of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64.
However, there are a couple of dependencies.  If you have 4-bit
precision, you don’t really need all those options; 1, 4, 16, or 64
would work just as well, at the cost of reducing your effective
precision to 3 bits at times.  Also, on a pixel screen you probably
don’t want a multiplier of 1024 and a mantissa of 15, or for that
matter a multiplier of 0.125 (though zooming in to clean up drawings
may be useful at times). Moreover, if you have a fairly precise point
where the mouse lingered long enough to give 8-bit precision, you
don’t really need multipliers like 32 or 64.  And for compression it
would be convenient to be able to make the ranges of the different
precisions nonoverlapping, in the way the implied leading 1 does in
non-denormalized floating point.  These interactions all seem too
complicated to find a simple solution to right now, though, so I’m
just noting them.</p>
<p>Suppose we code the (logarithm of the) multiplier, shared between ΔX
and ΔY, in a three-bit field, meaning a power of 4 between 1 and
16384; and we have another three-bit field (biased by 2) for the
length of the ΔX and ΔY fields, represented in 2’s-complement.  Then a
minimally precise data point would be something like 010'000'00'01,
which means +4 in the Y direction, +0 in X, and that’s 10 bits.  The
size field 000 means one data bit per coordinate, and the 10-bit data
with this size field form a family of 4×4 lattices of exponentially
varying sizes, covering the points (-2, -2), (-2, -1), (-2, 0), (-2,
+1), (-1, -2), ... (+1, +1), multiplied by their respective
multipliers.  All have the same (0, 0) point redundantly encoded.</p>
<p>These 10-bit-coded pairs have their worst-case error at vectors like
(+2.5, +2.5), which is in between the (+1, 0) and (+1, +1) of the
smaller lattice and the (+4, 0) and (+4, +4) of the larger lattice.
This vector would be thus encoded as (+1, +1) with an error of 2.12
units, 60% of its magnitude; this level of error would be justified
for movements so fast that they couldn’t hit a target whose D/W was
more than about 1.2, which is to say movements of under a + 1.2b,
which I estimated above as about 66 ms.  This gives a worst-case
bandwidth for this encoding of about 160 bits per second, six times
better than scrawling in Inkscape but almost three times worse than
desired.</p>
<p>If we can manage to encode points less frequently, as the 250 ms
example I mentioned earlier, we can hit 64 bits per second with 16
bits per pair.  Those 16 bits might look like 000'011'00110'11011,
which would be +6 in X, -5 in Y.  The lattices of 16-bit-representable
vectors overlap greatly, eliminating the holes in the
10-bit-representable values, and the worst-case relative error is
√2/32, about one part in 45, i.e., D/W ≈ 45, so a + 5b movement time.
With my pen handwriting guess figures, that would be 180 ms, but the
four times worse time with Inkscape suggests more like 720 ms.  So at
this level our bandwidth is in the ballpark.</p>
<p>(Is three bits of log₄ for the multiplier excessive?  If we only had
two bits of this exponent, the multipliers would be 1, 4, 16, and 64,
which last would need only 5 bits of mantissa to reach the edge of the
screen, and we’d improve worst-case bandwidth by 10%.  Variable-length
mantissas give us an escape hatch, though here they only allow us up
to ±256.)</p>
<h3>Successive approximations by alternately zooming in and out</h3>
<p>What if we represented these vectors not with a single data point but
a series of movements?  If we’re looking at a square picture divided
into nine subpicture, we could indicate which subpicture to zoom in on
with a number from 1 to 9, after which we can make another move, or we
could indicate that we want to stop zooming with the number 0.  This
gives a base-10 prefix code that uniquely identifies any arbitrary
recursively-divided square node.</p>
<p>The same digits in reverse indicate how to get back to the original
viewpoint from the zoomed-in viewpoint, so such a code can also
represent an arbitrary zoom out rather than in.</p>
<p>So if you want to indicate a sequence of points coupled with zoom
levels, relative to some reference point, you could use a sequence of
pairs of such codes: one to zoom out, then another to zoom in to the
destination.  The null movement case is 00; zooming in to the
upper-right corner is, perhaps, 090; zooming out by one unit and then
in to the lower-right corner is, perhaps, 5030.</p>
<p>Each digit takes 3.32 bits, so the minimal (null) movement is 6.64
bits, while the four-digit example “5030” is 13.28 bits.  A movement
that ends in a single zoom has a relative error of 0.5 either
direction, i.e., D/W = 1, so the time is a + b, and each additional
zoom (which must eventually be undone) gives you a factor of 3 (1.58
bits) extra precision in both X and Y, i.e., each extra 1.58b of MT
adds 6.64 bits, or 4.2 bits per b, which is reasonably close to the 2
to 5 bits per b minimally needed.  At my pen-based estimate of b =
30 ms, that’s 140 bits per second, but again the Inkscape results
being about four times slower would give more like 35 bits per second.</p>
<p>Maybe a better approach here might be just to specify the number of
levels to zoom out, rather than the specific direction to do it in,
which doesn’t matter very much.</p>
<p>Quite aside from the problem considered here of encoding a mouse
selection in a data file, this approach could be used to encode a
mouse selection on the keyboard, too, and it would enjoy
Fitts’s-Law-like efficiency properties, which the conventional
mouse-simulation approach of moving the pointer with arrow keys
definitely does not.  Maybe it could even be faster than using a
shitty mouse.  When I worked in a call center a quarter century ago, I
was pretty quick on the keypad.  I could always enter people’s credit
card numbers faster than I could convince them to say them.  I haven’t
used keypads much since then, though, and in a quick typing test with
typespeed(5) just now I was only able to reach about 1.49 digits per
second; on a second trial I reached 1.66. which is about 5.5 bits per
second, about the same as the 6-bit number I measured above for the
mouse.  (By comparison, typespeed measures me at 5.84 characters per
second, 70 wpm, on English words; in actual text I’m closer to 90.)
So maybe at least this wouldn’t be much <em>slower</em> than an actual mouse.</p>
<h3>Can we just punt to gzip somehow?</h3>
<p>Dercuano is compressed for download as a gzipped tar file.  What if,
instead of coming up with an up-front hypothesis about the
distribution of vectors in the drawings and then congealing it in a
pile of bit-twiddling code, we just handle the rounding part,
represent the vectors as bytes in some kind of straightforward way,
and then let gzip handle the entropy-coding part?  Gzip can also do
things like recognize common patterns (if they repeat exactly) which
we haven’t contemplated above.  When it plows into the front end of
the drawings, its entropy model is probably going to be attuned to
HTML, but if all the drawings are together in the tar file, then it
should have a pretty decent entropy model for drawings after a few
kilobytes.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this could actually work. I think the tricky part is
really not the bit twiddling, but the decisions about which points
should be in the “trellis” at each level of rounding.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
