(2 minutes)</div><p>It should be relatively straightforward to implement Bicicleta with
Self-style "maps" --- where each "map" contains a bunch of constant
things inherited from somewhere (in Self, cloned from somewhere) and a
few variable things.</p>
<p>Many objects in Bicicleta seem to inherit directly from some
widely-used global constant (prog.if, prog.sys.nil, and so on) and
then override a small number of things.  Objects that inherit directly
from a particular other object and override the same set of things can
share the same "map", just as if they were members of a Self clone
family.</p>
<p>If you take outer-self references into account as if they were
overridden slots, you can cover a larger number of cases.  For
example, prog.sys.rational.coerce:</p>
<pre><code>    coerce = {op: arg1 = 2
        '()' = prog.if(
            op.arg1.denom.is_ok -&gt; op.arg1,
            op.arg1.as_integer.is_ok -&gt; self.new(op.arg1.as_integer, 1),
            else = prog.error(\"could not coerce {arg1} to rational\" % op)
        )
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The 'coerce' methods in different 'rational' objects differ only in
their binding of 'self', and their children differ only in that and in
their binding of 'arg1'.  Ideally you could put most of this stuff
into a prog.sys.rational.coerce "map" object.</p>
<p>This brings up a bit of a problem --- ideally you'd have one map
object for all the (ordinary) coerce activation records, and those
activation records would just have slots for self and arg1.  As
proposed above, each rational object's coerce method would have only a
slot for self; but the activation records of a particular rational
object's coerce method would have a map of their own, corresponding to
that rational object.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
