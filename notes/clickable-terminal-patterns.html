(2 minutes)</div><p>libvte9 includes the ability to tell its clients if a particular
position is within a match to any of a list of regexps; this ability
is used by gnome-terminal and xfce4-terminal to make links in
terminals clickable.</p>
<p>However, the list of regexps is hardcoded.  It would be useful to add
additional regexps, for reasons like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on <code>grep -n</code> output like
  "./terminal/terminal-widget.c:292:" could request Emacs to open the
  file at the line in question.</li>
<li>Clicking on a company-internal bug number like "ITN-6748" could open
  the URL of the ticket in question.</li>
<li>Clicking on a date could open your favorite calendar app to that
  date.</li>
<li>Clicking on a Bitcoin address could open your Bitcoin client to send
  Bitcoins to its owner.</li>
<li>Clicking on an IP address could prompt you with various things to
  do: mtr, nmap, reverse DNS lookup, etc.</li>
<li>Clicking on a street address could search for it in Google Maps.</li>
<li>Clicking on a Twitter @username could open their Twitter page.</li>
<li>Clicking on a DOI number could look it up in a way appropriate to
  your campus.</li>
<li>Clicking on a phone number could call it, add it to your address
  book, or look it up in your address book.</li>
</ul>
<p>These suggest a configuration file with a syntax like</p>
<pre><code>/home/paul/bin/open-ticket ITN-[[:digit:]]+
/home/paul/bin/open-editor ^[./][^ ]*:[[:digit:]]+:
/home/paul/bin/open-calendar \&lt;[[:digit:]]{4}-[[:digit:]]{2}-[[:digit:]]{2}\&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where the scripts alluded to will be invoked with the matched string
as an argument.  <code>open-editor</code> could be implemented, for example, as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
exec &gt;"$HOME/editor.log" 2&gt;&amp;1
IFS=:
set $1
emacsclient +$2 $1 &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of xfce-terminal, this would involve:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dynamically allocating new pattern types when reading this file, in
   addition to the four predefined ones at
   terminal/terminal-widget.c:65.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding the new regexes to the libvte widget, along with the ones
   from <code>regex_patterns</code> at terminal/terminal-widget.c:78, in
   <code>terminal_widget_update_highlight_urls</code> at
   terminal/terminal-widget.c:772.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps factoring the two calls to <code>vte_terminal_match_check</code> in
   <code>terminal_widget_context_menu</code> at terminal/terminal-widget.c:292
   and in <code>terminal_widget_button_press_event</code> at
   terminal/terminal-widget.c:403 into a single thing?  In any case,
   wire them both up to invoke a new function to invoke the
   user-defined action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing the new user-defined action function, which would spawn off
   a subprocess with the requested command.</p>
</li>
