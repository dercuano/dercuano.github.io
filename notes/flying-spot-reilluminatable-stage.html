(1 minute)</div><p>One of the key cost drivers in television filming today is the
single-camera technique, in which each scene is filmed several times
with a single camera in different camera angles, in order to get the
lighting optimal.</p>
<p>You can use a flying-spot camera to do much of this in a single shot
using multiple photosensors, each one corresponding to a different
virtual light source, all filmed from the point of view of the
flying-spot illumination source.  This allows you to make a weighted
sum of the signals from the various light sensors after the fact in
order to compute a version of the scene with the proper “lighting”.</p>
<p>This doesn’t allow you to change camera angles (without multiple
flying-spot sources and the attendant difficulties with higher-speed
signals), but in many cases all that is needed is to crop a
higher-resolution shot down to the area of interest.</p>
<p>The standard approach since the 1950s to making flying-spot stages
livable for the actors is to illuminate them during the vertical
blanking interval with a strobe light.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/optics.html">Optics</a> (34 notes)
