<p>The standard API designs for graphics APIs are “immediate mode” and
“retained mode”. In immediate mode, you emit a series of drawing
operations, which typically change pixels, and that’s how you make
your graphic. This means you can emit more drawing operations than
there are pixels in the canvas, and in some cases you can do
animations by sending a series of operations. Memory usage and
performance are predictable, but not necessarily very good. <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>,
PostScript, GDI, and Xlib are immediate-mode APIs.</p>
<p>Retained-mode APIs, by contrast, maintain a set of graphical objects
in memory, and the API lets you create and modify those objects. Often
they’re arranged into a tree structure by containment. Typically they
are a lot more of a pain to use and use a lot more memory. The SVG DOM
is a retained-mode API.</p>
<p>Immediate-mode APIs, although they’re often easier to use, have a few
drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s a little bit tricky to make antialiasing work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can’t zoom. Or, rather, zooming involves redrawing. And that’s
   slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The drawn objects can’t be clickable because they don’t have
   persistent identities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This bit about redrawing, though, that’s interesting. Presumably the
entire structure of your immediate-mode graphic somehow inheres in
your code combined with the memory state it is interpreting. As long
as you can re-execute the code deterministically, you can redraw or
inspect whatever other behavior of the code you would like to inspect.</p>
<h2>Memory transactions and caching</h2>
<p>Optimistically-synchronized transactional-memory systems also rely on
the ability of bits of code to re-execute deterministically, as does
Umut Acar’s Self-Adjusting Computation. Optimistic TMs will roll back
a transaction when another transaction has written to a shared
variable that it has read, retrying it from the beginning with the new
value, potentially as late as when it attempts to commit. (Some TMs
also allow writes to leak out during transaction execution; in these
cases, if another transaction reads those writes, it must be rolled
back and retried if the writes are rolled back. This can lead to
livelock.)</p>
<p>The basic idea is that, if you can track all the bits of memory that
the code reads from outside of its ephemeral internal state, you can
be sure that the code would produce the same results if it were
executed again; and if you control its outputs, you can undo those
results if necessary. This allows you to confidently cache the results
of running it, among other things.</p>
<p>What if we did this with immediate-mode drawing? If we divide our
drawing into a series of possibly nested transactions, the transaction
system can provide the advantages of a retained-mode API potentially
without all the expense —– the transaction system can intelligently
trade off memory space against the possible inefficiency of having to
re-execute. It can, for example, compute a bounding box for each
transaction, and then, when zooming, only re-execute transactions that
impinge on the visible screen area. (You could also offer an a-priori
bounding-box function which tells you whether any of a given bounding
box is visible, so as to avoid executing things inside of it, but this
conflicts with the transaction system’s necessity for the viewport not
to affect the drawing; a reasonable compromise is to offer a “clip”
function which limits the visibility of further drawing to a given
bounding box.)</p>
<p>Also, of course, being able to confidently re-execute an
immediate-mode drawing enables us to detect clicks, if that’s a thing
we want to do.</p>
<h2>Data serialization</h2>
<p>We can apply an analogous approach to serializing and deserializing
data structures, with the highly desirable benefits of being able to
orthogonally cache serializations and writing the serialization and
deserialization code as one routine. An IMGUI library like Dear ImGui
might establish a mapping between a character buffer and a widget on
every drawn frame:</p>
<pre><code>ImGui::InputText("string", buf, IM_ARRAYSIZE(buf));
</code></pre>
<p>We might analogously establish a mapping between a character buffer
and a chunk of the input/output stream:</p>
<pre><code>int len = strlen(buf);
little_endian_32(&amp;len);
bytes(buf, len);
</code></pre>
<p>When serializing, <code>little_endian_32</code> will serialize <code>len</code> to the
stream (as a little-endian 32-bit binary number, I suppose); when
deserializing, it will overwrite its current value with the value
deserialized from the stream. Then <code>bytes</code> correspondingly reads or
writes the given number of bytes.</p>
<p>We could imagine running the above in a transactional context that
tracks its reads and the output bytes and is thus able to cache the
output bytes and not re-execute the code when the inputs haven’t
changed.</p>
<h2>Backtracking</h2>
<p>A transaction system is perfectly entitled to checkpoint
partially-executed transactions so that it can restart them from a
checkpoint, rather than from the beginning, if it needs to retry
them. This may be more expensive (it needs to save the entire
ephemeral state of the transaction, not just the program counter and
inputs) but at some point it may be less expensive. This corresponds
to chronological backtracking in AI search — if you checkpoint the
transaction before returning the results of each nondeterministic
choice, perhaps implemented as a read of a transactional variable, you
can run a chronological-backtracking search over its execution space,
searching for a set of nondeterministic choices that yields a
successful execution.</p>
<p>We can do better, though; with nested transactions, we can do
non-chronological backtracking as well. Normally the failure of a
nested transaction will result in the failure of the outer transaction
as well, but the nested transaction may depend on far less input data
than the outer transaction. The inputs to the nested transaction (its
arguments and the set of nondeterministic choices made within it)
comprise, for the purposes of backtracking, a nogood set. This should
allow some degree of non-chronological backtracking, although it
doesn’t allow the transaction system to direct the search procedure to
nondeterministic choices with fewer remaining alternatives.</p>
<p>In the context of serialization and deserialization, chronological
backtracking amounts to recursive-descent parsing, and the transaction
system is capable of the kind of memoization that allows Packrat
parsers to guarantee linear-time parsing. I’m not sure if it’s
possible to derive Earley parsing from recursive-descent parsing in
this way.</p>
<h2>Reducing working sets</h2>
<p>Although all of the above is written from a big-computer perspective,
the thing that originally attracted me to immediate-mode GUIs was
Arduino menu systems. I hacked together an Arduino menu system that
uses only a few bytes of RAM by using ImGui principles — from one call
to the next, it only tracked the user’s position in the menu tree, but
the menu tree itself was generated on demand by callback code, which
of course was not stored in RAM.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
