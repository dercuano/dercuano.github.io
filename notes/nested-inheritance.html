Nystrom, Stephen Chong, and Andrew C. Myers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our work on the Polyglot extensible compiler framework [27], we
found that ordinary object-oriented inheritance and method
dispatch do not adequately support extensibility. Because
inheritance operates on one class at a time, some kinds of code
reuse are difficult or impossible. For example, inheritance does
not support extension of an existing class library by adding a
given field or method to all subclasses of a given
class. Inheritance is also inadequate for extending a set of
classes whose objects interact according to some protocol, a
pattern that occurs in many domains ranging from compilers to user
interface toolkits. It can be difficult to use inheritance to
reuse and extend interdependent classes.</p>
<p>Nested inheritance is a language mechanism designed to support
scalable extensibility. Nested inheritance creates an interaction
between containment and inheritance. When a container (a namespace
such as a class or package) is inherited, all of its
components — even nested containers — are inherited too. In
addition, inheritance and subtyping relationships among these
components are preserved in the derived container. By deriving one
container from another, inheritance relationships may be concisely
constructed among many contained classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve thought for a while that one of the advantages of Bicicleta’s
language is that it supports this kind of extensibility.  However,
their approach causes a class that “overrides” a class from another
container to inherit from that other class, unlike Bicicleta’s
approach, which seems to be more similar to the “virtual class”
mechanism of BETA and “Genericity in Java with virtual types”.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
