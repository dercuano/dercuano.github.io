(6 minutes)</div><p>In a publish-subscribe system you have a message bus to which messages
are posted.  The message bus may be a literal wire (as in thinnet
Ethernet, CAN, and RS-485), a computer (as in Ethernet with a switch),
a running program on a computer (as in D-BUS), a group of running
programs on one or more computers (as in IRC or IP multicast), a data
storage device (sort of as in Kafka), or some combination.  The
messages posted to it are then received by some subset of subscribers
to the message bus.</p>
<h2>Why filtering?</h2>
<p>The simplest approach is to send every message to every subscriber,
but this has both performance problems and security problems: making a
copy of the message for a subscriber who doesn't want it is wasted
work, and maybe so is the work the subscriber has to do to determine
that they don't want it; and if you have a security policy that
prohibits some subscribers from looking at some messages, this
approach makes that policy entirely dependent on those subscribers not
attempting to violate it.</p>
<p>So most pub-sub systems have some kind of filtering system that only
sends each message to some subset of subscribers.  These filtering
systems can be more or less expressive; for example, you can have a
disjoint set of topics (like IRC and IP multicast), a hierarchy of
topics (like ZeroMQ), a non-disjoint set of tags with single-tag
subscriptions, boolean tag subscriptions, boolean queries on message
field values, and so on.  The more elaborate filters let through a
more precise approximation of the messages the subscriber is really
interested in, wasting less work on forwarding messages the subscriber
will ultimately discard.</p>
<h2>Turing-complete interests</h2>
<p>The subscriber's real interests may be Turing-complete (assuming the
subscriber is a computer program --- human interests might be more
complex); determining whether a packet fulfills them or not may in
fact be uncomputable.  In <a href="../notes/fast-secure-pubsub.html">Fast secure pubsub</a> I talked about
running a subscriber-provided interest function in a time-limited
sandbox where its accesses to message fields are recorded; if it
rejects the message, those accesses are added to a cache so that any
future messages with the same values in those fields will also be
rejected without rerunning the function, thus saving time.  Similarly,
if it accepts the message or times out, any future messages that are
similar in that way will be forwarded to the subscriber.  (And senders
can provide a filter function that determines whether or not a
subscriber is allowed to examine a message; its behavior differs in
that if it times out, the message is not forwarded.)</p>
<p>In addition to just "accepting" a message, the interest function might
reasonably take other actions as well; in particular, it might post a
message somewhere, and it might map the accepted message to a smaller
message, so that less data needs to be copied to the subscriber
itself.  However, these actions are much harder to memoize with the
purely-sandboxing approach described above.  Suppose the incoming
message says {x: 32, y: 31, topic: "mouse"}, and the interest function
inspects the topic and x fields before mapping the message to the
message {p: 32} to be sent to the subscriber.  The sandbox is able to
determine that the y field does not matter, so future messages with
the same x and mouse fields should be handled the same way.  But it
has no way to determine whether the message {x: 48, topic: "mouse"}
should even be accepted, much less whether the resulting message
should be {p: 32}, {p: 48}, {p: 16}, or something else.</p>
<h2>Non-Turing-complete interests</h2>
<p>But a different approach is suggested by BPF and Bitcoin Script, as
described in <a href="../notes/wercam-scriptable-windows.html">Scriptable windowing for Wercam</a> in a different context.
Instead of having the subscribers send a Turing-complete program to
the message bus, they can send a program in a non-Turing-complete
bytecode, perhaps one without loops or subroutines, so its execution
time can be statically bounded.</p>
<p>This is pretty close to the original purpose of BPF and its 1980
predecessor CSPF: the packet-dumping program, tcpdump or whatever,
gives the kernel a "subscription request" in the form of a BPF
program, and the kernel evaluates all such program on all incoming
packets, forwarding only the accepted packets to the userspace
program.</p>
<p>The subscriber can generate the bytecode program by doing abstract
interpretation of the Turing-complete program representing its
interests, somewhat like a tracing JIT, but using abstract values.
This generates a safe conservative bytecode approximation of its
original Turing-complete program; this bytecode can then be sent to
the message bus to do the prefiltering.</p>
<p>There is an example of how to do this in <a href="../notes/failure-free.html">Patterns for failure-free, bounded-space, and bounded-time programming</a> in the
section "Abstract interpretation with non-standard semantics".</p>
<p>This abstract-interpretation approach is applicable to a variety of
situations in which a non-Turing-complete program is required,
especially if a conservative approximation is acceptable.  So, for
example, given some Turing-complete specification of a security rule
to make a message visible only to certain subscribers, a conservative
approximation is not acceptable; this approach is only applicable to
that problem if the full execution tree can be successfully explored.</p>
<h2>Database queries</h2>
<p>From a certain point of view, a database query is just a pubsub
subscription that is immediately run on a stored history of past
events; but this point of view doesn't have an obvious way to account
for sorting specifications and joins, which do things like index
traversals and intermediate materializations.  However, the comparison
operators used to construct and traverse indices, as well as the
tuplewise computations used to filter and transform result streams,
could profitably be specified by such bytecode chunks, rather than by
an ever-growing set of data types built into the database engine.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/sa.html">Systems architecture</a> (48 notes)
