<p>I was thinking about the problem of composing graphical textures in a
user interface, and it occurred to me that a neat formulation was
possible using just functions of the form ℝ² → ℝ², which I will call
“textures”.  The whole system functions by composing textures out of
more primitive textures.</p>
<p>(Perhaps I should recast this as functions of the form ℂ → ℂ?  That
would conveniently provide rotation and a wide variety of conformal
mappings, and it would substantially reduce the number of functions
needed, though it would require the redefinition of ×, ÷, and **
(and compensating additions of their elementwise variants), and
probably I should be renamed Z.)</p>
<h2>Visualization on the screen</h2>
<p>The idea is that the inputs to a texture are coordinates representing
the position on the screen, and the outputs represent in some sense a
color.  To fully specify an RGBA color, you need two textures (I
suggest using HSVA with one texture for HS and the other for VA, or
YUVA with a YA/UV split), but you can quite reasonably visualize
individual textures by using a constant for the other texture.</p>
<h2>Atomic textures</h2>
<p>The most basic textures you start with are numeric constants, I, and
T.  Constants such as 0.3 are interpreted as having that value
everywhere for both components: λ(x, y) → (0.3, 0.3).  I, or meshgrid,
is the identity function: λ(x, y) → (x, y).  T, or transpose, is
almost the same, but returns the coordinates in reverse order: λ(x, y)
→ (y, x).</p>
<p>The standard functions abs, ln, exp, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, and
atan are also available as atomic textures, and they also apply
elementwise; e.g., sin(x, y) = (sin x, sin y).</p>
<p>You could imagine loading in (channels of) image files as additional
atomic textures.</p>
<h2>Binary or combining operations</h2>
<p>Two special shunting operations are provided: composition, written
backwards with tightest precedence with “.”, and joining, written with
loosest precedence with a comma, “,”.  Composition A.B is just λ(x, y)
→ B(A(x, y)), while joining combines values from the different
functions; if A(x, y) = (ax, ay) and B(x, y) = (bx, by), then (A,
B)(x, y) = (ax, by).  The opposite combination can be achieved by
composition with the aforementioned T texture, as (A.T, B.T) = (ay,
bx).  (For convenience, we could define textures X as (I, I.T) and Y
as (I.T, I), so you can write A.X to get just the X output of A on
both channels.)</p>
<p>A fairly standard list of binary arithmetic operations apply
pointwise: +, -, ×, ÷, //, %, &amp;, |, &amp;^, ^, **.  That is, given that
a(x, y) = (xa, ya) and b(x, y) = (xb, yb), (a ** b)(x, y) =
(xa**xb, ya**yb), (a &amp; b)(x, y) = (xa &amp; xb, ya &amp; yb), etc.  In
this way you can compute, for example, 3 + 4 * 5 * I % 1.  % is the
modulo operation, // is integer division as in Python, ** is
exponentiation, ^ is XOR as in C, and &amp;^ is the and-not,
set-subtraction, or abjunction operation, as in Golang.  Binary
operations are applied to fractions as binary fractions.</p>
<p>Comparison operations are also provided: ==, &gt;=, &lt;=, &gt;, &lt;, != all
apply pointwise to textures and produce answers of 0 or 1,
representing, respectively, true or false, as in C.  So, for example,
(3, 4) &lt; (3, 5) produces (0, 1).</p>
<p>Finally, four-dimensional simplex noise is provided with the # binary
operator.</p>
<h2>Interactive user interface</h2>
<p>For playing with these textures, it occurred to me that you could
probably usefully compile them into GLSL shaders for real-time
display, and use an RPN-calculator approach like <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/rpn-edit">rpn-edit</a> or
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/81hacks/autodiffgraph">autodiffgraph</a> to provide instant feedback on each new atomic texture
as it’s created; the multitouch approach described in <a href="../notes/interactive-calculator.html">Interactive calculator</a> might be more usable on hand computers.</p>
<p>Additional atomic textures <code>t</code>, the current time, and M, the mouse
coordinates, would facilitate simple interactive animations.
Multitouch puppetry could be handled in a variety of ways, the
simplest of which is something like variables t0, t1, t2, t3, t4 for
the first five touches.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
