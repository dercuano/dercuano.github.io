(9 minutes)</div><p>Your user interface is a hard real-time program and should be designed
and implemented as such.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about how to build a full computing
environment “from scratch”, in the sense that it wouldn’t depend on
any previously-designed hardware or software.  This is for a few
different reasons.  One is Dan Ingalls’s contention that if the system
is too complicated for a person to understand, they are limited in how
they can use it as a medium for creative expression.  Another is that
current systems are insecure by design, and for economic reasons, this
is unlikely to change.  A third is that current systems are
irreversibly addicted to the astoundingly-high-performance computing
hardware that we currently only know how to produce with
correspondingly-astounding concentrations of investment, to the point
that only three companies in the world — TSMC, Intel, and
Samsung — are currently able to produce devices at the 10-nm process
node.</p>
<p>But a fourth reason is that in some important ways, in particular user
interface responsiveness, current systems are dramatically worse than
they could be; fixing it will require a rewrite.  There are other such
ways, such as security, but I will focus on responsiveness here.</p>
<h2>Hard real-time programming versus normal programming</h2>
<p>There’s an established discipline of “hard real-time programming”,
which I will distinguish from normal programming by first describing
normal programming.  In normal programming, the most important thing
is that, if your program runs successfully, the output it produces is
correct; the second most important thing is that it run successfully,
or at least produce a helpful error message explaining what caused it
to fail; and, if these criteria are met, it is always more desirable
for the software to run faster, especially on average, so we would
like the software to be as fast as possible, as long as that does not
interfere with correctness or success.</p>
<p>Hard real-time programming is very different from normal programming;
it’s programming software for things like antilock brakes and jet
engines.  What distinguishes it from normal programming can be
summarized in two slogans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Late answers are wrong answers.</li>
<li>Failure is not an option.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, in hard real-time programming, each piece of output has a
deadline; if it misses that deadline, it is worthless.  Overdue
answers are unusable.  Consistency of execution time is more important
than its shortness.  Also, almost invariably, it is not acceptable for
a program to fail some of the time, for example due to lack of
resources.  The antilock braking program must work every time you
press the brake pedal, not 99% of the times.</p>
<p>Hard real-time programming isn’t “hard” in the sense of “difficult”;
you can do it on an Arduino.  It’s “hard” in the sense that the
deadlines that the program’s execution must meet are hard.</p>
<p>Hard real-time programming and what I’m calling “normal programming”
are two ends of a spectrum, representing two different reasons we
might use computers.  In normal programming, we run a program because
we do not know what the output will be, but we want to find out,
because we imbue it with some kind of meaning.  In hard real-time
programming, we know exactly what the output will be, and rather than
goggling at it, we want to use it to control some aspect of our world.</p>
<p>In between there are many shades of gray, and most programs have some
aspects of both.  But it isn’t unidimensional.  For example, in “soft
real-time programming”, it’s important to not miss deadlines, but
results computed too late for their deadline are still of some use.
In another category, somewhat incorrect answers are acceptable, as
long as they are on time; there exists a whole field of algorithm
design for this, known as “anytime algorithms”, many of which are for
mathematical optimization problems.  More about this later!</p>
<p>Most of academic computer science focuses on normal programming, and
most programming languages and tools are written with normal
programming in mind.  Enormously more code is written for normal
programming than for hard real-time programming.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these profound differences, it is often impossible
to repurpose code written for a normal program as a real-time program,
or vice versa.</p>
<h2>The user interface should be written as a hard real-time program</h2>
<p>My core argument is that the part of the user interface closest to the
user should be written as a hard real-time program, for the following
three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>because human beings are very sensitive to user interface latency;</li>
<li>because a crashing user interface is very similar to a whole
  crashing computer (or maybe a whole crashing cluster of computers);</li>
<li>because they interact directly with video hardware, which generally
  pumps out frames of video at a constant rate, so pixels that are
  computed too late will be lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>By “the part of the user interface closest to the user” I mean the
hardware and code that interfaces with human-interface output devices,
such as sound cards, video cards, or laser projectors, and
human-interface input devices, such as touchscreens, accelerometers,
microphones, cameras, mice, keyboards, and joysticks.  If the same
interface device is used as an interface to more than one different
program, the user interface code in question has the task of safely
multiplexing that device among those programs.</p>
<h2>How are hard real-time programs written?</h2>
<p>They are much smaller than other programs, because — partly because of
being written with tools designed for normal programming, and despite
what I said above about “hard” — they are actually harder to write
than normal programs.</p>
<p>Typically they don’t do any dynamic memory allocation, both because
dynamic memory allocation generally takes a nondeterministic amount of
time and because it can fail, which is not an option.  As a result,
they usually run in statically bounded memory space, making them
formally executable by finite-state machines.</p>
<p>Typically when they do do dynamic memory allocation, they use simple
arena allocators or per-type allocators, which are constant-time.</p>
<p>They virtually never use virtual memory.  Virtual memory is instant
death to hard real-time systems, except in the unusual case that the
deadline is so long that it can tolerate disk seeks.</p>
<p>Typically they use very simple algorithms, because these are often
easiest to prove time bounds for and because more complicated
algorithms often require dynamic allocation.</p>
<p>More often than you would expect, they are written in assembly
language, which simplifies the task of worst-case time analysis.
Occasionally they are written in ladder logic or other such
hardware-focused formalisms.</p>
<p>Often, they run on dedicated hardware, which is often a stripped-down
microcontroller; timing becomes more predictable with less
peripherals, no virtual memory, and less tasks per processor.  Since
in a sense the desired outputs are already known before the program
starts, it is often possible to perform useful tasks even with very
little processor power, so even today, many hard real-time systems run
on 8-bit processors such as 8051s, PICs, and Z80s.</p>
<p>Formal methods of logical proof are somewhat more frequently used for
hard real-time programs than for normal programs.</p>
<p>The above is, of course, somewhat idealized.  But it provides the
general outlines of the situation.</p>
<p>Anytime algorithms are not currently widely used for hard real-time
programming, perhaps because they are viewed as exotic.  An “anytime
algorithm” is one that can provide an answer at any time after
starting, but will produce better answers if allowed to run longer.
Most often, these work by computing a series of progressively better
answers, each an improvement on the previous answer.  Many
mathematical optimization algorithms, such as those often used to
approximately solve constraint-satisfaction problems, work in this
mode normally.</p>
<p>Instead of anytime algorithms, hard real-time programs typically use
algorithms that execute in constant time or a time with a hard upper
bound.  Instead of amortized-constant-time or amortized-logarithmic-
time algorithms, they must use algorithms with a worst-case constant
or logarithmic time bound, and keep their dataset size small enough
that the necessary linear-time-or-worse algorithms don’t miss
deadlines.</p>
<p>It’s common to use bounded-size nonblocking FIFOs to communicate with
real-time code.</p>
