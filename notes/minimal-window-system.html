<p>For whatever reason, windowing systems are de rigueur for personal
computing systems.  What’s the smallest one you could build?
Computers are fast enough now, since about 2000, to redraw the whole
screen every frame, so there’s no need to faff about with hacks to
avoid redrawing parts of the screen.  We just have to keep a cap on
how many times per frame we draw each pixel, on average.</p>
<h2>A pull shared-memory windowing system</h2>
<p>Each application shares a memory segment with the window system.  The
window system has a list of windows, which it can reorder, each with
four numbers: (dx, dy) for the window origin and (sx, sy) for the
window width and height.  Each frame, the window system composites the
application windows together into the framebuffer, using the painter’s
algorithm.  This involves copying rows of pixels from the shared
memory segments into the framebuffer, some of which will be
overwritten later with other pixels.  Each application also has an
input queue for keyboard, mouse, and frame events.  Keyboard events
always go to the topmost window; mouse events go to the topmost window
that contains the mouse, except that the mouse-focused window stays
fixed while the mouse moves with a button held down.</p>
<p>Frame events indicate the completion of a frame, telling the
application that it is now free to scribble over the window buffer
used in that frame.  Atomic pointer writes allow the application to
update its window to a different framebuffer (in the same
shared-memory segment) for resizing or double-buffering.</p>
<p>Two possible worthwhile enhancements: support (premultiplied) alpha;
don’t draw windows that are invisible because they are completely off
the screen or completely covered by another window, and (combined with
that optimization) divide the screen into 32×32 pixel “subscreens” or
tiles that are drawn independently.  The first enhancement gives you
not only window transparency but also a crude approximation of shaped
windows; the second should keep the compositing overdraw to a minimum
under most circumstances.</p>
<h2>A push tile-stream windowing system</h2>
<p>Each application sends the window system a sequence of commands, which
can include requests to position or size its window or tiles of pixels
to draw in it.  The window manager sends back a sequence of events.</p>
<p>If the IPC mechanism supports transferring ownership of blocks of
memory (or, sort of equivalently, immutable data) then the tiles need
not be copied between memory spaces.  If they are, say, 32×32 tiles of
32-bit pixels (4096 bytes each), then a 3840×1024 screen would be
120×32 such tiles, 3840 of them in all.  If the drawing command itself
is an (x, y, w, h, framenumber) tuple with 16-bit fields, the 3840
tiles work out to 38400 bytes of messages, while the pixel data is a
bit over 15 megabytes, 409.6 times larger.  Sending 15 megabytes in
3840 write() calls on Linux on my laptop would work out to about
300ns · 3840 = 1152μs for the calls plus 171ps · 15728640 = 2689μs for
a total of 3.8 milliseconds — a somewhat excessive amount of time,
especially when you consider that the window system needs to read all
those bytes, too, taking roughly as long.</p>
<p>A simple test program on Linux is able to create 65000 4096-byte
memory mappings for a 4096-byte file in 290ms using mmap(), or about
4.5 μs per mapping.  (It fails when it attempts to create more than
that.)  This means that mmap() is actually a bit slower than copying
for such a small mapping, but it doesn’t get any slower when the file
goes up to 8 megabytes.  A different operating system might make
somewhat different performance tradeoffs, but there’s no strong reason
to suspect that Linux’s implementation is profoundly suboptimal.</p>
<p>There’s the question of whether the tiles should be fixed-size and
whether they should be required to be pixel-aligned on a grid.  If we
take as a priority that the window system should be efficiently
nestable, the answers are no — we want intermediate window servers to
be able to pass along drawing commands as they arrive, but they may
not draw a full tile, and they may be offset so that tiles that are
pixel-aligned in the window aren’t pixel-aligned on the screen.</p>
<p>This architecture is not nearly as amenable to alpha-blending.</p>
<h2>Performance thoughts</h2>
<p>Consider the tiled pull design on a 128×32-tile four-mebipixel screen
with an average of two drawable windows per tile — some tiles have
only one, while other tiles have window overlaps and translucent
overlays.  It needs to read 8 mebipixels (32 mebibytes) from window
buffers and write them into the 4-mebipixel (16 mebibytes) output
image, but the tiles are 4096 bytes and thus fit in cache, so this
will probably only amount to 16 MiB of write traffic to main memory,
for a total of 48 MiB.</p>
<p>My laptop can manage about 2 GB/s of large memcpy traffic on one core
and about 4 GB/s across all four cores.  At 60fps that’s a budget of
67 MB of memcpy traffic per frame — this is cutting it pretty close,
because it means 75% of the CPU’s RAM bandwidth would be devoted to
just filling the screen.  It also includes an “Intel HD graphics”
engine with 16 execution units, which you could imagine might be
capable of blitting quite a bit faster.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Eighth_generation">Wikipedia confirms</a> that
the GPU has 25.6 GB/s of memory bandwidth.</p>
<p>This approach requires only some 8192 blit commands per frame
rendered, leaving about 2 μs to process each one.  Even CPython
function calls would be fast enough, as they take only about 200 ns on
one core.  However, if the commands a CPython program was sending were
one level lower — individual scan line segments — there would be
roughly 32 times as many comands, and CPython performance would be
inadequate.</p>
<p>As it happens, Numpy is capable of doing this kind of thing, because
it has mutable multidimensional arrays.  A quick test finds that
copying 128 MB of RAM via numpy takes 64 ms, which works out to 2
gigabytes per second.  However, doing a million small blit operations
in this way took 5.4 μs per blit, which is too slow by more than a
factor of 2.</p>
<pre><code>def draw(n):
 for i in range(n):
  j = (i % 200) * 5
  fb[j:j+5, 0:8] = fb[:5, :8]
</code></pre>
<p>Factoring out the source image, as if that were realistic, got it down
to 3.9–4.0 μs.</p>
<pre><code>def draw(n):
    src = fb[:5, :8]
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i % 200) * 5
        fb[j:j+5, 0:8] = src
</code></pre>
<p>So I could maybe make it work, barely, by taking advantage of
multicore, or with a smaller screen, like 1Mpix, or like 30fps.  Or by
giving up on the small-subscreen approach and doing more precise
occlusion calculations to do bigger blits and eliminate overdraw.  (My
laptop is only 1920×1080.)</p>
<p>If we have 3ms to draw the screen with an overdraw factor of, say, 2
due to alpha, then our 2 GB/s gives us 6 MB.</p>
<h2>Vectorizing precise rectangular occlusion calculations</h2>
<p>For more precise rectangular occlusion calculations, we could imagine
a scan line as a sequence of (pixelcount, sourcewindow) pairs, and a
screen as a sequence of (linecount, scanline) pairs.  To compute a
scan line, we can sort the window vertical edges (dx and dx+sx) and
walk from left to right across the scan line, maintaining a Z-ordered
heap of windows under the current pixel position, yielding spans when
the topmost window changes.  A similar calculation for window
horizontal edges yields spans of identical scan lines, although it may
not be a priori clear which scan lines are going to be identical; it
might be better to use an identical-span-merging procedure on the
sequence of generated spans, both horizontally and vertically:</p>
<pre><code>def coalesce(spans, reducer=operator.add):
    c = None    # Current span
    for k, v in spans:
        if c is None:
            c = k, v
            continue

        pk, pv = c
        if k == pk:
            c = k, reducer(v, pv)
        else:
            yield c
            c = k, v

    if c is not None:
        yield c
</code></pre>
<p>This constant-space algorithm is a generalization of run-length
encoding, <code>uniq</code>, and <code>uniq -c</code>, and is actually the reduce phase of
map-reduce, assuming the sorting in between the map and reduce is
already taken care of.  (God damn it, I’m going to end up programming
in Rust after all, aren’t I?)  For simple data, like
<code>list(zip(floor(arange(128)/10), ones(128)))</code>, it takes about 5μs +
750 ns/item.</p>
<p>To make this work with some windows having alpha, for each span, we
need to store either the whole window stack or enough of the layers on
top to reach opacity, rather than just the topmost window.  If there
is no alpha and everything is opaque, it’s overdraw-free.</p>
<p>The whole computation doesn’t quite fit into the map-reduce mold
because, although the windows map to pairs of edges, there’s a
computation in between to find the differences of the sorted list.</p>
<p>There’s a way to express this algorithm, for the addition case, in
three lines of Numpy, but I hesitate to describe it as
“straightforward” because I keep putting bugs in it when I implement
it:</p>
<pre><code>def coalesce(ks, vs):
    last = concatenate((ks[1:] != ks[:-1], [True]))
    v = cumsum(vs).compress(last)
    return ks.compress(last), concatenate(([v[0]], diff(v)))
</code></pre>
<p>In APL, given the inputs in k and v, I think that would be something
like this:</p>
<pre><code>(L/k) ,[1] w[0],(1↓w)-⁻1↓w←(L←((1↓k)≠⁻1↓k),1)/+\v
</code></pre>
<p>except that that doesn’t handle cases where k and v have different
data types, and also I haven’t tested it because LinuxMint doesn’t
come with APL.</p>
<p>For largish arrays (1e8 trivial items) on my laptop this takes 11 ns
per item, about a 20th of a 200-ns Python function call; for a
256-item array, it takes 75 μs (290 ns/item); for a 512-item array, it
takes 80 μs (160 ns/item, or about 20 ns per additional item), while
for a 65536-item array, it takes 805 μs (12 ns/item).  This suggests
some slight nonlinearity and a rather hefty Numpy overhead of about
70 μs (about 350 Python function calls) per call.  This makes it
faster than the longer generator version above for more than about 90
items, but potentially an order of magnitude slower for small cases.</p>
<p>A more assembly-style imperative Numpy implementation might do a
better job by reducing memory allocations.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>def coalesm(ks, vs):
    last = ones(len(ks), dtype=dtype('bool'))
    not_equal(ks[1:], ks[:-1], last[:-1])
    v = cumsum(vs).compress(last)
    result_v = zeros(len(v), dtype=v.dtype)
    result_v[0] = v[0]
    result_v[1:] = v[1:]
    result_v[1:] -= v[:-1]
    return ks.compress(last), result_v
</code></pre>
<p>This is somewhat faster on large data sets — the earlier version takes
about 19 ns per item to count the duplicates in
<code>floor(arange(1e8)**.1)</code>, while this version takes about 11 ns.  Both
take 11 ns per item for trivial int arrays.  It is, if anything, about
a microsecond <em>slower</em> for small problems, as you would probably
expect.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
