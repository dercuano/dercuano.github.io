(2 minutes)</div><p>What’s the simplest instruction set for a compiler that can compile
itself?  I think you probably need some kind of looping construct,
some kind of way to read in bytes, some kind of way to output bytes,
and probably sequencing of statements.  You can probably avoid much
parsing by making the input instructions be single bytes, but you
probably still need some kind of arithmetic to calculate the jump
offsets.</p>
<p>Mats Linander’s Awib is a multi-target optimizing BF compiler written
in BF, with six backends (it can output Linux i386 ELF executables, C,
Tcl, Golang, Ruby, and Java), so BF is clearly a sufficiently powerful
language to write a self-compiling compiler in.  (It also contains an
ASCII-art portrait of Meriday in the morning and can be compiled as
Tcl, bash, or C, as well as BF.  Truly impressive.)  It’s about 43
kilobytes, and it would presumably run under Urban Müller’s original
240-byte AmigaOS BF compiler or Brian Raiter’s 199-byte Linux version:

<p>Daniel B. Cristofani has written a much more minimal BF self-compiler,
targeting C; I found a copy at
<a href="http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/impl/compilers/dbf2c.b">http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/impl/compilers/dbf2c.b</a>, and he
has a copy on his own web site at
<a href="http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/dbf2c.b">http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/dbf2c.b</a>.  It seems to
work; anyway, I compiled it with itself, verified that it produced the
same output when compiled with the self-compiled version of itself,
compiled Linus Åkesson’s Game of Life with it, and played Life
successfully on the result.  Cristofani’s self-compiler for BF is 1183
bytes, but running Erik Bosman’s bfstrip utility from
<a href="http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/utils/bf-tools/bfstrip.c">http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/utils/bf-tools/bfstrip.c</a> on it
reduces it to 904 bytes.</p>
<p>So, one approach to bootstrapping things from BF would be to compile
programs from other languages into BF, and then run them with one of
these BF interpreters.  But I think there’s a much more interesting
approach available, which is to add some instructions to a
self-compiling BF implementation, recompile it with itself, and then
update it to use the new instructions.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
