(4 minutes)</div><p>It's often more convenient in practice to use feet and yards than
meters because you can divide them evenly into three, four, six, or
nine equal units, with a convenient whole number of inches.  For the
same reason, the Babylonian sexagesimal system remains in use today
for angles (360 degrees, each subdivided into 60 minutes of 60
seconds).  In some sense, both 10 and 12 are composite numbers, but 12
seems much "more composite", and 60 is "more composite" still, much
more so than 100.</p>
<p>What are the "most composite" numbers, the ones that can be evenly
divided in the most different ways?  Of course you can always get more
factors if you go to a larger number, but some numbers have more
factors than any number smaller than themselves; there's a definite
sequence of these "most composite" numbers, and there aren't really
very many of them.  You might think that you'd just go with the
products of the primes: 2, 2·3 = 6, 2·3·5 = 30, 2·3·5·7 = 210, and so
on; but it turns out that 30 only has six proper divisors greater than
1 (2, 3, 5, 6, 10, and 15), but 24 beats it by having the same number
of factors and being smaller.  It substitutes a versatile, lightweight
extra couple of 2s for 30's 5, thus getting the same number of factors
sooner.</p>
<p>It turns out our old friends 12, 36, 60, and 360 are in this sequence,
along with 4 and 6.  However, 360·60 = 21600 is not, because once you
get past 720, it behooves you to start throwing a 7 in there.  The
champion that beats poor old Babylonian 21600, with its mere 70
divisors, is 10080 (2⁵·3²·5·7) with 70 divisors, or alternatively
20160 (2⁶·3²·5·7) with a whopping 82 divisors!  (I'm still leaving out
1 and the number itself, here.)</p>
<p>Here's what I've computed so far:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; nfactors = lambda n: len([x for x in range(2, n) if n % x == 0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; best_nfactors = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; while True:
...  i += 1
...  n = nfactors(i)
...  if n &gt; best_nfactors:
...   print i, n
...   best_nfactors = n
...

<p>Unsurprisingly, I'm not the first person to discover this; the
standard term is "highly composite number", and it's sequence A002182
in OEIS.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you're looking for a base for a positional
numbering system that will give you maximum divisibility, 30 beats 24,
and 210 is better still.  True enough, in base 24, an eighth is simply
0.3, while in base 30, it's 0.3,22,15, which is more awkward; but in
base 30, a fifth is 0.6, while in base 24, it's an infinite sequence:
0.4,0,19,4,0,19,...!  Infinite sequences are far more awkward to
calculate with.  Base 210 gives you perfect divisibility --- in a
finite number of fractional positions, but maybe more than one --- for
any number of portions up to 10, and any composite number up to 21,
plus of course many other numbers.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/math.html">Math</a> (78 notes)
