(2 minutes)</div><p>I was thinking about how to make a vocoder on the way to the office
today, and it occurred to me that a fairly simple approach might be to
use CIC filters.</p>
<p>Essentially the idea is that, for a single band, you use a
moving-average filter (or more than one) over past samples to get a
decimated (and thus low-pass-filtered) version of the signal; then you
use a recurrent comb filter fed with, say, a subtraction between
adjacent decimated samples, to estimate how much it’s oscillating at
harmonics of the comb filter’s fundamental.  Because the signal is
decimated, you have very little frequency precision, which is what you
want for vocoder band detection.</p>
<p>In particular, most human voice energy is between 64 Hz and 2048 Hz,
which is a range of only five octaves; Wikipedia says, “There are
usually between eight and 20 bands,” so something like half-octave
resolution is called for.  Dudley’s original 1939 Voder used 10 filter
bands.  I think it might be necessary to subtract amplitude signals
from overlapping bands to get such high frequency precision with
simple decimated signals.</p>
<p>Then you can use a similar process in reverse to apply the band
coefficients to the carrier signal you want to vocode.</p>
<p>I’m thinking that it might be possible to get a working vocoder in
about ten or twenty lines of C with this approach.</p>
<p>...having tried it in Numpy, I’m no longer as optimistic, although
maybe there’s a way.  The issue is that you need really good
attenuation in the stopband, and to be able to invert by subtracting,
you need really, really precise zero-phase response — one milliradian
of phase error is already a limit of -60dB on your stopband
attenuation, and 10 milliradians is -40dB.  I think it might still be
possible.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
