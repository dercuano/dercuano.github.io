<p>How can you parallelize or incrementalize the evaluation of a finite
state machine?  Although this has been considered in the past in the
context of parallelizing text search queries like WAIS across Thinking
Machines, this is a particularly important problem right now, because
tokenization is almost always the performance bottleneck of simple
compilers and parsers, and parallelization is the key to performance
on modern computers.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>All of this is well known; it’s included in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/papers/Ble93.pdf">Blelloch’s 1993 review of
parallel prefix sum computation</a> but was almost published by Ladner
and Fischer in 1980, and then was published by Hillis and Steele in
1986.</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>A simple and general approach which yields logarithmic running time
for an NFA on a sufficiently large parallel machine is as follows.
Assume WOLOG that the text length <em>n</em> is a power of 2.  Begin with an
ε-free NFA.  For each character <code>c[i]</code> for <code>i</code> from 0 to <em>n</em>-1 of the input
text, in parallel, compute a relation <code>t[i, i+1]</code> as the set of edges in
the NFA that transition on <code>c[i]</code>.  Then, in lg <em>n</em> parallel steps,
coalesce adjacent intervals in <code>t</code> into larger intervals with this
compose operation: compose(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>), where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are relations, is the
ordinary relational composition operation, which produces the
relation (<code>s[j]</code>, <code>e[j]</code>) for the maximal set of <code>s[j]</code>, <code>e[j]</code> such that for
each <code>j</code> there is at least one <code>m</code> such that (<code>s[j]</code>, <code>m</code>) is in <em>a</em>, and (<code>m</code>,
<code>e[j]</code>) is in <em>b</em>.  In each parallel step <em>h</em>, we are coalescing intervals of
size 2<em>ʰ</em>⁻¹ with this composition operation.</p>
<p>That is, in step <em>h</em> &gt; 0, for each <code>i</code> divisible by 2<em>ʰ</em>, we compute</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>t[i, i+2</code><em>ʰ</em><code>]</code> = compose(<code>t[i, i+2</code><em>ʰ</em><code>⁻¹]</code>, <code>t[i+2</code><em>ʰ</em><code>⁻¹, i+2</code><em>ʰ</em><code>])</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>using the values we computed in step <em>h</em> - 1.</p>
<p>The size of the relation for any given interval of any size is capped
at the square of the number of states in the NFA, so in the worst
case, it does not increase with the length of the text, so for a given
NFA, this takes Ω(lg <em>n</em>) runtime in the worst case.  Average-case
analysis is trickier, in part because it depends both on what an
“average” NFA is and on what an “average” text is, but my intuition is
that, in practical cases, the relation size for a text span of any
length more than a few characters will be under, say, 10.</p>
<p>Sooner or later you need to constrain the leftmost state to be the
NFA’s initial state; it is probably best to do this by a special case
in computing <code>t[0]</code>, since that will save work in all the nodes that
include it.</p>
<p>Having done this, you can propagate the results back down the tree of
intervals in another lg <em>n</em> steps, providing you with the exact
reachable set of NFA states at each character boundary in the initial
input.</p>
<p>This is the standard Blelloch prefix-sum algorithm, merely using the
relational composition operator as the reduction operation rather than
numerical addition.  (Apparently Kogge–Stone is more common in current
codebases?)</p>
<p>In theory, you can get about a 5% improvement in total runtime by
coalescing triples of adjacent intervals in each step rather than
pairs.  In practice, depending on the relative costs of communication
and computation, the optimal branching factor may be something
different from 2, 3, or 4.  For example, if communication has high
latency, it may be 32 or 1024.  (This also depends on the
characteristics of the NFA: a higher branching factor may reduce the
size of the intermediate-result relations substantially.)</p>
<p>Reducing an NFA to a DFA is useful for many computational models, but
in this case, the larger number of states in the DFA is likely to be a
handicap.  You probably want to be coalescing your intervals using the
smallest alphabet of states you can get away with.</p>
<p>In practice, you probably want to do most of the computation serially;
if you have 8192 cores, the best you can do is an 8192× speedup
(ignoring superlinear speedups from caching and the like) so you might
as well start out generating 8192 <code>t[i, i+m]</code> values on the 8192 cores
by linearly running the finite automaton over each of 8192 chunks
(probably as a lazily-materialized DFA rather than as an NFA),
followed by, say, 13 steps of alternating communication and
coalescence.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Using Bjoern Hoehrmann’s new parsing algorithm “<a href="https://github.com/hoehrmann/demo-parselov">parselov</a>”, which
conservatively approximates the language of a context-free grammar by
compiling a stack-limited conservative approximation of its PDA into a
finite automaton, it should be possible to perform nearly all of the
work of parsing in parallel using this algorithm.  However, I’m not
entirely sure how big parselov’s finite automaton is, and if it has a
sufficiently large set of intermediate states, this might not work.</p>
<p>Google Code Search used to provide a public regular expression search
over all public code.  For normal kinds of regular expression
searches, where you aren’t interested in matches bigger than a few
megabytes, parallelization on a cluster is probably not useful.  If
you do need larger matches, for example on genome or proteome
searches, parallelism may be useful.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://julesjacobs.github.io/2015/06/17/disqus-levenshtein-simple-and-fast.html">Levenshtein automata</a>, you can generate reasonable-sized
NFAs to find strings within a small Levenshtein distance of a given
string.  (Baeza-Yates and Gonnet, I think, came up with a different
way to do this that takes advantage of bit-parallelism in modern CPUs
and is therefore usually faster in the serial case.)  However, if the
text being searched is static enough to be indexed, it is probably
faster to run Levenshtein automata on a suffix array of the text,
especially now that we have compressed indexing and practical
linear-time suffix-array construction algorithms.</p>
<p>You can use a variant of this algorithm to incrementally update
finite-state-machine results — the construction is the usual
construction of an incremental algorithm from a parallel algorithm,
where the high concurrency of the dependency graph of the values
computed during the execution of the algorithm translates into being
able to change some of the input without invalidating much of the
total data flow graph.  Concretely, if one of the input blocks at the
leaves of the tree changes, you recompute its mapping of starting
parse states to ending parse states, then propagate that change back
up and down the tree, potentially affecting the parses of all
subsequent blocks.</p>
<p>You can also use this approach to parse a <em>substring</em> of a sentence of
a regular language, simply by starting the parse of the leftmost block
with the “superposition” of all states, like the other blocks, rather
than the usual initial state.  This is potentially useful, for
example, for syntax highlighting in a text editor (or in a code
snippet in a web page) or for parse-error recovery in a compiler.
Moreover, the substring parse can then be extended in either direction
by inspecting a larger part of the sentence.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
