(2 minutes)</div><p>Old Crays had vector instructions.  These used a “vector length”
register and a “vector mask” register to specify which items in the
vector to process.</p>
<p>On the Cray Y-MP C90, there were eight vector registers, V0 to V7,
each containing a 128-element vector of 64-bit values; a vector
instruction would process corresponding elements of two of these
registers, two at a time, and deposit the results in another vector
register.  But you didn’t have to process all 128; the “vector length”
register could terminate the process early if you didn’t have that
many.</p>
<p>These vector instructions could be pipelined in the sense that the
result from one could be fed incrementally to another, as long as they
used different functional units.</p>
<p>Vector registers were loaded from and stored to central memory using a
“block transfer” with a first word address, an increment or decrement
(stride), and a vector length; and this could participate in the
pipelining.  Thus a sequence of vector instructions could construct a
flow graph that loaded some sequences of values from main memory,
processed them, and wrote them back to main memory, all in a pipeline,
but the viewpoint of the assembly program was that it was conducting a
series of in-order operations on large vectors.  As the manual says,
“The CRAY Y-MP C90 computer system allows a vector register reserved
for results to become the operand register of a succeeding
instruction.”</p>
<p>There were also scalar registers, which could be used with vector
instructions as arithmetic operands.</p>
<p>The only vector integer operations provided were sum, difference, and,
or, xor, and leading zero count.  In floating-point, you had the usual
operations, except that instead of division, you had only reciprocal.</p>
<p>The “vector mask” register could be used to select elements from one
vector or another, or to replace selected elements with zero or a
scalar register.  (In related selection operations, you had a
“register shift” group which I don’t understand.)  The vector mask
could be set by numerical tests on a vector register: [&lt;=&gt;≤≥≠]0.
There was also a variant of the VM-setting instruction that puts the
indices of the matching elements into another vector register,
although I don’t think there was a way to use those indices except one
at a time.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
