(3 minutes)</div><p>Here's a simple network protocol that provides a reasonably secure and
reasonably efficient content-addressable storage system.</p>
<h2>Basic operations</h2>
<p>The fundamental operations provided by the protocol are PUT and GET.
PUT has a single argument, which is an arbitrary blob — although in
this case I am limiting blob sizes to those that can be passed in a
single internet datagram; GET also has a single argument, which is the
cryptographic hash of a single blob.</p>
<p>(If you have several servers providing this service, you can arrange
them into a DHT as you see fit; the servers don't have to know about
it.)</p>
<h2>Adding security</h2>
<p>Both of these are, in some sense, unauthenticated operations: if your
data isn't public, you can encrypt it with a secret key before you
store it in the public content-addressable store, and so attackers
will gain no useful information by retrieving it.  However, they are
subject to denial-of-service attacks.  First, since the server
presumably has limited storage, the amount of data that can be
successfully PUT to it and GETted back later is finite; second, since
the server has limited bandwidth, the amount of data that can be PUT
or GETted from it in a second is finite.  Finally, GET could
potentially be a tool in a source-spoofed DoS amplification attack on
someone else: if the GET request is 20 bytes, but the resulting blob
is 20000 bytes, you can multiply your bandwidth by 1000 by sending a
stream of source-IP-spoofed GET requests to an innocent server, which
will faithfully direct a firehose of traffic at your chosen victim.</p>
<p>I think we can add DoS-resistance to the protocol with hashcash (or
other forms of making requests expensive — reciprocity IOUs, Bitcoin
payments, etc.), and amplification-resistance with mandatory request
padding.</p>
<h2>Protocol proposal</h2>
<p>So I propose an additional NO answer, and reusing the PUT packet to
send answers.  A typical PUT dialog looks like this:</p>
<p>client: PUT nonce=b, blob=a</p>
<p>server: NO nonce=c, difficulty=n</p>
<p>client: PUT nonce=d, blob=a (such that HMAC(c, a || d)[0:n] == 0)</p>
<p>server: PUT nonce=d, blob=a</p>
<p>And a typical GET dialog:</p>
<p>client: GET hash=e, nonce=f</p>
<p>server: NO nonce=c, difficulty=n, length=m (m = length(a))</p>
<p>client: GET hash=e, nonce=g, pad=h (such that HMAC(c, e || g)[0:n] == 0, and length(h) &gt;= m)</p>
<p>server: PUT nonce=g, blob=a</p>
<p>The server is free to share the nonce between clients, or not, and
change it as often as it likes (potentially requiring slow clients to
retry requests).</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
