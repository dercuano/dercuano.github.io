(1 minute)</div><p>I want to do a reduced-affine-arithmetic raytracer.</p>
<p>The idea is that an “image” is a function from pixel coordinates x and
y to color component intensities r, g, and b, and we merely want to
compute an adequate approximation to that function.  We recursively
subdivide the image into rectangular regions, and restrict ourselves
to a linear approximation within each region, so that the overall
approximation is piecewise linear (though not necessarily continuous
between the pieces).</p>
<p>In this way, we can avoid spending much computation time on smooth
gradient regions, concentrating on the regions where aliasing is
possible.</p>
<p>Extending this, a “video” is a similar function, but has three
independent variables: x, y, and t.  This allows us to avoid spending
computation time on parts of the scene that don’t change much from
frame to frame.</p>
<p>You can derive such an approximation by applying a self-validated
arithmetic model from a mathematical description of the ray-traced
scene.  Most self-validated arithmetic models only give you
zeroth-order approximations in any given region; interval arithmetic
and the use of Lipschitz constants are examples.  Affine arithmetic
gives you a first-order approximation, but it is crushingly
computationally expensive; reduced affine arithmetic, though it
doesn’t provide such tight bounds, is more efficient, and has been
successfully used for raytracing.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
