(1 minute)</div><p>Many of the perceptual deficits of autism — difficulty recognizing
familiar faces when a hat or beard is added or removed, stress and
meltdown when facing departures from routines or minor changes in
environment such as a book out of place on a bookshelf, memory of
perceptual details neurotypicals don’t notice or consider unimportant,
difficulty distinguishing signals in the presence of background noise
or environmental chaos, inflexible behavior — while commonly
attributed to executive-function deficits, bear a suggestive
similarity to a pathology in machine learning and in particular
artificial neural networks called “overfitting”, in which a learner
adapts itself to particular examples from its training set at the
expense of generalizability.  Perhaps, at the human neural level,
overfitting is a general mechanism that causes many of the different
characteristic manifestations of autism.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/psychology.html">Psychology</a> (18 notes)
