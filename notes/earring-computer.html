(1 minute)</div><p>The Lattice ICE40LP1K and ICE40HX1K FPGAs are big enough to support a
J1a CPU (with 8K of RAM?) and are 1.4 × 1.5 × 0.45 mm and <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/lattice-semiconductor-corporation/ICE40LP1K-SWG16TR50/220-1870-2-ND/4571911">cost
US$3.43</a>.</p>
<p>The TI ADS7040 8-bit 1Msps ADC <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/ADS7040IRUGR/296-38605-1-ND/5051706">has an 8-X2QFN version that is 1.4 ×
1.4 × 0.4
mm</a>
and costs US$1.14.  It claims “nanowatt power consumption” by which
they mean that it uses less than a microwatt at 1ksps.  At 100ksps it
uses 56μW, and the datasheet claims a physically impossible 49dB SNR
(48.16 being the theoretical limit of what 8 bits can deliver).  It
uses 12MHz SPI and uses differential input.  If you were to run it at
1Msps and downsample to audio 48ksps, you would gain about 7dB more.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
