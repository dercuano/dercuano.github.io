<p><a href="https://www.renesas.com/us/en/doc/products/mpumcu/doc/rl78/r01ds0193ej0220_rl78g12.pdf">The RL78/G12 datasheet</a> describes a low-power 16-bit 31-MIPS
24 MHz microcontroller, supported by GCC.  At first glance, <strong>it
appears to run under 100 pJ per instruction, but this is not true</strong>;
my calculations from inspecting the datasheet and the Hardware User’s
Manual suggest more like 450 pJ per instruction, nearly twice the
230 pJ/insn that excited me about the STM32L0 in <a href="../notes/stm32.html">Notes on the STM32 microcontroller family</a> — and
the STM32’s instructions are 32-bit instructions!</p>
<p>These are my notes from reading the datasheet and some other sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RL78">Wikipedia tells me</a> it descends from the NEC 78K0R, which descends
from the 8-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/78K">78K/0</a>, which NEC launched in 1986.  The “G” in
“RL78/G12” is “general-purpose” as opposed to LCDs, industrial, or
automotive use.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/renesas-electronics-america/R5F10278ANA-W5/R5F10278ANA-W5CT-ND/9169595">The R5F10278ANA#W5 member of the family</a> costs US$2.01 in quantity
1, US$0.986 in quantity 1000, at Digi-Key, with almost 5000 in stock.
This is the version with 24 pins, 8 KiB of program Flash, 2 KiB of
data Flash, and 768 bytes of RAM.</p>
<h2>Supporting hardware</h2>
<p>It runs on a single power supply, which can be 1.8 to 5.5 V, and
includes a ±1% on-chip oscillator, which can do up to 24 MHz.  So you
don’t need a ceramic resonator; you need a crystal if you need tighter
timing than that.  (The lower-end R5F103 line is ±5%.)</p>
<p>If you do use an external crystal, you’re limited to 20 MHz, or 8 MHz
if you’re under 2.7 V.  I don’t see anything about being able to use a
32.768 kHz crystal, which would be ideal for precisely timed sleeps.</p>
<h2>CPU</h2>
<p>It’s a 16-bit architecture with a 1-megabyte address space, 2–16 KiB
of program Flash (rewritable 1000 times), in some cases 2 KiB of data
Flash (rewritable 1,000,000 times if you only care about 1-year data
retention, or 10,000 times for 20 years), and 0.25 to 2 KiB of on-chip
RAM, and 8 8-bit general-purpose registers — comparable to an AVR in
power and the 8086 in convenience, so programming it in C seems like a
reasonable thing to do.  (And there are four register banks,
presumably like the Z80, for interrupt handling and other task
switching.)  It says it’s CISC, but also that it has a 3-stage
pipeline.</p>
<p>Oh geez.  The registers are “AX”, “BC”, “DE”, and “HL”.  Then it has
ES, CS, 8-bit registers “A”, “X”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E”, “H”, and “L”, a
carry flag, an auxiliary carry flag (!), a PC, and an SP.  The memory
map starts with interrupt vectors.  This thing is damn close to being
an 8080.  There’s an “ES:” instruction prefix (a la 8086 segment
overrides) and a register bank select (a la Z80).  Unlike the 8080, it
has indexed addressing modes (no Z80-style IX and IY, though).  And,
yes, there are instruction timings — mostly 1 or 2 clocks, or 4 or 5
clocks if you’re accessing Flash.</p>
<p>It’s maybe not totally surprising NEC copied Intel; I had an NEC V20
IBM-compatible once.</p>
<p>Unlike the 8086, the ES and CS registers are shifted by <em>8</em> bits
before forming the effective address, not <em>4</em>.</p>
<p>The INC and DEC operations don't affect the carry flag, but they do
affect the zero flag.</p>
<p>The instruction set listing (without opcodes) takes 17 pages, but
mostly that’s because they listed the large number of addressing modes
separately (since they vary by instruction), so MOV takes up 2½ pages.
Seems like it’s probably on the order of a Z80 in complexity.</p>
<p>The general-purpose registers (all four banks!) are mapped into
memory.  Also, code and data are in the same memory space — no
AVR-style Harvardry here.</p>
<p>It includes a 32×32→32-bit multiplier but no floating-point.  It’s
mapped into memory as a device.  (All the devices are memory-mapped;
there are no IN and OUT instructions.)</p>
<p>The smallest chips in the family, the ones with only 2 KiB of program
Flash, can’t reprogram their own Flash under program control.  The
others can.</p>
<p>The interrupt system has multiple priorities, four hardware and one
software.</p>
<p>There’s a <em>separate</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/us/en/doc/products/mpumcu/doc/rl78/r01us0015ej0220_rl78.pdf">“RL78 Family User’s Manual: Software”</a>, which
I haven’t read; it has instruction maps in it.</p>
<h2>Power usage</h2>
<p>This is the main attraction!  But it turns out to be false.  It's
actually specified to be worse than an STM32L0!</p>
<p>It says “basic operation” at 24 MHz is 1.5 mA, but “normal operation”
is 3.3–5.0 mA; these numbers do not depend on voltage, except that
running at 24 MHz at all requires you to be at 2.7 V or more.  3.3 mA
÷ 24 MHz is 138 μA/MHz, twice the 63 μA/MHz touted on the datasheet’s
front page, but maybe they were talking about “basic operation”, which
is not defined, but apparently only possible at 24 MHz.  Lower-speed
numbers do not use lower currents per MHz, but they do use lower
voltages; low-speed 8-MHz mode is 1.2–1.8 mA, at either 2 V or 3 V.
This is slightly worse — 150–230 μA/MHz — but uses less power (300
pJ/cycle rather than 370) because of the lower voltage.</p>
<p>Moreover, the “31 DMIPS at 24 MHz” on the front page is also
misleading.  <strong>This is not a superscalar chip</strong>; at best it can run
one instruction per cycle, and many instructions take 2 cycles.  It
might really manage 16 million instructions per second.</p>
<p>That means those 300 pJ/cycle are really 450 pJ/insn!  That’s almost
<em>twice</em> what the STM32L0 claims in its datasheet.  (I probably ought
to verify its claims.)</p>
<p>They also have modes HALT (110–1210 μA, leaves clocks running) and
STOP (0.19–2.20 μA, doesn’t leave clocks running).  Restarting the
clock after STOP can take a while.</p>
<p>These power numbers generally don’t include peripherals, including the
timers needed to wake up.  The low-speed on-chip oscillator uses
0.20 μA, the interval timer 0.02 μA, and the watchdog timer 0.22 μA.
The ADC uses 500–1700 μA.</p>
<p>Leakage current is specified as ±1 μA per pin, which is enough to be
worrisome.  (Presumably you could use external multi-megohm resistors
to cut down on that.)</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.renesas.com/us/en/doc/products/mpumcu/doc/rl78/r01uh0200ej0220-rl78g12.pdf?key=f401aa89134140ce2e8c584b674848e5">RL78/G12 User’s Manual</a>” documents SNOOZE mode, which, using the
on-chip oscillator, makes it possible to trigger ADC conversions from
a timer without waking the CPU, or to receive UART or SPI data.</p>
<p>In STOP mode you can use the interval time and watchdog timer, but not
the PWM-generating timer array.  Ports remain latched.</p>
<p>As for “Basic operation”?  Not documented anywhere.  Maybe they’re
running a NOP loop or something.</p>
<h2>Peripherals</h2>
<p>It has three timers (an interval timer, a timer array with 4–8
channels, and one that is a watchdog), I²C, a 4Mbps UART, 12Mbps “CSI”
(which appears to be Renesas’s name for SPI), and a rather sad ADC.
The timers can run from a low-speed 15-kHz (±15%) on-chip clock, which
I assume is to save power while sleeping for an interval.  Some of its
pins are N-channel open-drain for 5-volt tolerant I/O.</p>
<p>There’s a DMA controller that can be used for the ADC, SPI, and even
GPIO ports.</p>
<p>The ADC has 11 channels, but only 10 bits, and it needs 39 μs to
complete a conversion (except in low-voltage mode, when it needs 95).
The internal voltage reference is specified as 1.38–1.50 V, which is I
guess ±9%, and it has a temperature sensor that’s 3.6 mV/°C, which I
guess you can select as an ADC input, with 25° being 1.05 V.  It seems
like this means that measuring the temperature against the internal
reference has an error of ±24°, which is unusable except for emergency
shutdown.</p>
<p>It has a lot of interrupt lines, like, 15 or so.  Presumably this is
also to facilitate waking from sleep.</p>
<p>It can source 20 mA or sink 10 mA per pin (40 mA absolute maximum), up
to a maximum of sourcing 140 mA or sinking 100 mA (170 mA absolute
maximum), plus some other minor restrictions.  Also it has loosely
specified pullups (10–100 kΩ) on chip.</p>
<p>The timers can be clocked from off-chip data.</p>
<h2>Development tools</h2>
<p>FreeRTOS and ChibiOS/RT run on it.</p>
<p>GCC supports the R78 line.  There’s a note in the datasheet about an
“on-chip debug function” in the datasheet but it just says it’s
“provided”; I don’t know if it’s provided with free software.</p>
<p>There is some documentation of programming waveforms.  It has a
“TOOL0” pin with a dedicated UART which can be used to reprogram the
device via serial data at 115,200 baud, 250 kbaud, 500 kbaud, or 1
Mbaud.  The hardware user’s manual refers me to “RL78 Microcontrollers
(RL78 Protocol A) Programmer Edition Application Note (R01AN0815),”
which presumably means that the programming protocol is public and so
probably someone has implemented it.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The RL78/G12 looks like a reasonable 16-bit microcontroller, if a bit
anemic; it’s broadly comparable to an AVR, but faster, and uses much
less power than an AVR does.  In a lot of ways it looks like “the 8088
done right”, and if there’s a version of the chip with more RAM, it
might be reasonable to do a self-hosting development environment on
it.</p>
<p>However, in the usual cross-compilation context, it seems hard to
justify choosing an RL78 over an ARM Cortex-M chip like the STM32L0,
which uses half the power, runs more than twice as fast, has
first-class debugging support in free software (maybe the RL78 has
that too?), and has more pins and an ADC that runs 110 times as fast.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
