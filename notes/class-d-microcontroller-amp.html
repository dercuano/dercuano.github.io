(5 minutes)</div><p>Some folks at the Fabricicleta were asking me a few years back about
making high-efficiency amplifiers for audio from bicycles, so that you
can really blast music driven by a five-watt hub generator I guess.</p>
<p>Suppose you use, say, a 180MHz Cortex M3 LPC1830 as your processor,
and suppose that you can only output one bit every two CPU cycles, or
90MHz.  A simple pulse-density modulation scheme that swings from
100010001000... to 111011101110... should limit the artifactual
waveform from the PDM modulation to one fourth of the bit rate, or
22½MHz; it can approximate waveforms of up to -6dB.  Then you can feed
this bitstream into a Darlington or a power FET or whatever, then
filter its output reactively to avoid power dissipation.</p>
<p>(There may actually some lower frequencies that show up from
dithering: 10101101010110..., for example, has an oscillation whose
period is seven bit times.)</p>
<p>This 22½MHz is three decades or ten octaves above anything we need to
reproduce for audio purposes.  Even with just a single-pole 6dB/octave
LR or LC filter, you get 60dB of attenuation as long as the cutoff
frequency is at or below 20kHz; I think that with two stages of LC
filter, you’ll get 24dB/octave, which would give you 240dB of
attenuation.  You should be able to use fairly small-value inductors
and capacitors for this, because the total amount of energy stored for
half a cycle of a 22MHz wave is very small.</p>
<p>Supposing we’re driving an 8Ω speaker, we’d probably like the output
impedance of the final-stage filter to be a lot smaller than that at
20kHz.  This actually means that the entire signal path from the
amplifier through the two inductors to the speaker needs to have a lot
less than 8Ω impedance, say, 0.8Ω.</p>
<p>Capacitive reactance is 1/ωC, while inductive reactance is ωL.  This
suggests that our maximum total inductance is when ωL = 0.8Ω, which
happens when the inductors total 6.4μH.  And we’d like the second one
to have most of that, so, say, 0.6μH in the first inductor, and 5.8μH
in the second one, thus 75 milliohms of reactance in the first and 730
in the second.</p>
<p>Now we want our capacitors to ground to have the same reactance as the
inductors at our 20kHz cutoff frequency.  So, for the first one, 75 mΩ
= 1/(2π 20kHz)C, ∴ 2π 20kHz C = 1/75mΩ, ∴ C = 1/(2π 20kHz 75mΩ) =
106 μF.  That’s a reasonably attainable value, though it has to be
electrolytic.  The second one need only be 11μF.</p>
<p>Digi-Key’s most popular inductor, with 1,077,238 in stock at the
moment, is a 10¢ TDK 82nH 150mA inductor, the MLK1005S82NJT000.
Sadly, its DC resistance is 1.8Ω, because it’s in an 0402 package (1mm
× 0.5mm), so it can’t serve as a high-efficiency reactive filter for
an 8Ω speaker unless we put a bunch of them together.  Which is
actually a reasonable thing to do.</p>
<p>Digi-Key's most popular inductor in the right range of inductance and
DC resistance is Murata’s LQM2HPN1R0MG0L, a 34¢ 1μH (±20%) 1.6 amp
55mΩ ferrite-core inductor in a 2520 (2.5mm × 2.0mm) package.  Its
minimum self-resonant frequency is 60MHz, which suggests that it may
actually not be a great choice here; it might capacitively couple
through the exact high-frequency energy we want to stop.</p>
<p>If I restrict to only inductors with a self-resonant frequency over
180MHz, the most popular is the TDK MLZ1005MR47WT000, a 28¢ 470nH
500mA 200mΩ multilayer ferrite-core inductor with a 260MHz
self-resonant frequency, in the same 0402 package as the most popular
one.  It's marketed as an “inductor for decoupling circuits”.  Its
saturation current is 120mA, which I guess means that above 120mA it
doesn’t induct any more.  120mA on an 8Ω load would be 115 milliwatts,
but I guess you could use several of these inductors.</p>
<p>I don’t know, I guess I have a lot more to learn about reactive
filters.</p>
<p>Could you just wind the inductor yourself?</p>
<p>L = μ n² A / l, where μ is the permeability, n is the number of turns,
A is the cross-sectional area, and l is the length.  So if I want an
inductor of 6 μH or so, 12 turns with a radius of 1 cm and a length of
1 cm and no core would be about right; or 39 turns with a radius of 1
cm and a length of 10 cm and no core.  I feel like you could probably
keep the parasitic capacitance and resistance down to trivial levels
with that approach.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
