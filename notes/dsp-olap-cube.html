(4 minutes)</div><p>All of what is below the line below is somewhat wrongthink.  A cube is
the wrong shape; what you want is some set of perhaps abundant,
perhaps relatively prime <em>lags</em> with (possibly running) totals along
each lag.</p>
<p>Running totals make incremental updates in the middle inefficient, but
they permit efficient selection of arbitrary time-domain ranges.
Running <em>second-order</em> totals permit efficient selection of arbitrary
time-domain trapezoidal windows, which may actually be more valuable
in many cases.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code>b   a               b   a               b   a               b   a               b 
2,  7,  6,  8,  8,  1,  9,  7,  2,  9,  8,  7,  1,  2,  3,  5,  4,  4,  6,  7,  4 x
2,  7,  6,  8,  8,  3, 16, 13, 10, 17, 11, 23, 14, 12, 20, 16, 27, 18, 18, 27, 20 running sum by 5
2,  7,  6,  8,  8,  5, 23, 19, 18, 25, 16, 46, 33, 30, 45, 32, 73, 51, 48, 72, 52 running sum ⅱ by 5
2,  7,  6,  8,  8,  1, 11, 14,  8, 17, 16,  8, 12, 16, 11, 22, 20, 12, 18, 23, 15 running sum by 6
2,  7,  6,  8,  8,  1, 13, 21, 14, 25, 24,  9, 25, 37, 25, 47, 44, 21, 43, 60, 40 running sum ⅱ by 6
c                       c                       c                       c

<p>If we want the sums of the periodicity-5 component of x, we can just
take the 5 last values of the second row.  For example, 27 (column a)
is 7 + 9 + 7 + 4, and 20 (column b) is 2 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 4.  If we want
the sums of the periodicity-5 component of some substring of x, we can
subtract the 5 corresponding values from earlier; for example, the
values 7, 6, 8, 8, 3 represent the totals after the first 6 elements,
and we can subtract those from the final 5 elements to get the sums
over this shorter interval.</p>
<p>The “running sum ⅱ” lines are the running sums (with lags) of the
corresponding running sum lines.  This allows us to compute average
values of the running sum over some arbitrary interval; with two such
average values of the running sum, we can calculate the sum over an
interval of the original signal, but with fuzzy boundaries on the
window.</p>
<hr />
<p>Suppose that as you acquire samples from some signal, you assign them
raster-wise to elements of a 6×5×7 “cube”, maintaining a running total
of the samples for each of the 6×5 one-dimensional slices along the Z
dimension.  This requires two memory updates (one add) per sample.
When you finish with one such 210-sample cube, you move on to another.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to take the dot product of a 210-sample cube with an
arbitrary waveform of period 6, you can start by generating the
stride-6 totals from the pre-existing totals on the 6×5 face of the
cube, which requires 24 additions.  Then you perform your 6
multiply-adds and get your result.</p>
<p>You can take those 30 totals and add them up differently to get the
periodicity-5 component of the waveform.</p>
<p>This structure accelerates several other variants of the same
computation, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you only want to perform the dot product on a fortunately aligned
  30-item or 60-item substring of the samples, you can take one or two
  rows of the 5×6 totals, rather than all of them.</li>
<li>If you want to take dot products with several different period-6
  waveforms, you can use the same totals.</li>
<li>If the waveform is actually of period 2 or 3, rather than 6, you can
  do 4 or 3 additions instead of some of the multiply-adds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other dimensions may have different advantages.  12×14×13, for
example, with 12×14 totals, gives you somewhat efficient dot products
with waveforms of 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, and <em>24</em> samples — because the
12×14 totals can be added up in groups of 7 to get the period-24 wave.</p>
<p>This data structure, then, allows you to do certain computations with
short-period waveforms at very low cost, while also permitting
efficient incremental updates.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
