(165 minutes)</div><p>XXX transactions are useful for reactive programming because they
prevent ordering problems?</p>
<p>In 2012 I wrote about “choosing powerful primitives for a simplified
computing system”,
including as examples gzip and other things, and speculating about
automated cache management.  Well, since then, automated cache
management has kind of gone mainstream in the form of "reactive
programming" frameworks.  What other things could drastically simplify
our software systems?</p>
<p>My focus here is on what kinds of mechanism could support a wide
variety of applications, eliminating complexity from the application
code, without having to write and maintain separate, specialized
versions of that mechanism in different parts of your computing
system; and by so doing, make the system less complex, more
approachable, and more adaptable to new situations.  I’m looking for
candidate components with a high "strength-to-weight ratio", in the
sense that their internal complexity is low compared to the
functionality they provide, and also a low "surface-to-volume ratio",
in the sense that they impose very little extra complexity on
applications that use them, compared to their own internal complexity,
so the application is simplified greatly by not containing its own
reimplementation of their functionality.</p>
<p>In particular, such mechanisms need to be acceptably efficient across
their wide range of uses, rather than performance-optimized for one
particular use.  If this isn’t the case, experience has shown that
people will write customized versions of them for their particular
application, rather than investing effort in further optimizing the
general-purpose mechanism.  The result is that specialized mechanisms
proliferate, overall system complexity explodes without a
corresponding increase in power, composability suffers, and none of
the specialized mechanisms receives enough attention to make it
efficient.  This should sound familiar, since this is the tarpit we’re
in today.</p>
<p>I believe this matters for a few different reasons.</p>
<p>One is that, as Dan Ingalls says, to be a medium for personal
expression, a system needs to be comprehensible by a single person.
And this is the vision that has motivated Smalltalk, the VPRI STEPS
project, and Chuck Moore’s FORTH work.  It unfortunately suffers a bit
from mostly appealing to very independent-minded people.</p>
<p>A second reason is that this poor architecture results in decreasing
returns to software work, which matters economically at a societal
level.  People’s day-to-day lives are largely driven by what we might
call economic factors: do you have to spend your time washing clothes
by hand and sewing them up, or can you use machinery to make that
easy?  Is your house warm?  Do you have running hot water and safe
drinking water?  What do you have to do to make a living — does it
compromise your health or moral integrity? XXX</p>
<p>A third reason is that software freedom is fundamental to individual
human rights, to collective economic justice, and to individual
economic justice in the 21st century, but the freedom to study and
modify software you can’t understand is only theoretical, and the
power of that freedom is multiplied by the modifications and
enhancements you actually can manage to make in your limited time.</p>
<p>Software freedom is fundamental to individual human rights because
whoever controls the software controlling your cellphone, your
pacemaker, your hearing aid.  They can see photos of your genitals, if
you ever take them, and from Snowden’s revelations we know that some
of them pass them around the office for laughs.  They can trick you
into thinking your friends hate you, that your husband is cheating on
you, that the Jews faked the Holocaust.  They can judge you based on
what you read or who you’re friends with, and secretly tell other
people about those judgements, and those other people may be the
police.  Once you have the pacemaker, they can kill you, and nobody
will ever know it wasn’t natural.</p>
<p>Software freedom is fundamental to collective economic justice because
it allows every country or group of people to prosper independently of
the rest.  Over time, we can expect the strong standardizing tendency
of software to standardize on a small number of operating systems, a
small number of web browsers, and so on.  Without software freedom,
that will result in enormous economic returns accruing to the vendors
of the dominant software, which can then extend their monopoly power
into new areas of software: perhaps Apple, Microsoft, Google,
Facebook, and Amazon, but just as likely, a few new companies that you
haven't heard of yet, probably in China.</p>
<p>Software freedom allows everyone to participate in production, while
proprietary software moves us toward a world where, if you don’t live
in Seattle, Shenzhen, or California, you can only consume, or at best
source “user-generated content”, not produce or participate as an
equal.</p>
<p>Many governments have responded to this harsh reality by trying to
pretend that software is just one industry among many, and they can
import software just as they import oil, while focusing their domestic
industry on shipbuilding or steel production or something.  But the
truth is that your shipyards, your ships, and your steel mills will
get most of their value from software — if not in 2015, then surely by
2035.</p>
<p>Software freedom is fundamental to individual economic justice because
unless you were born to wealth, your other choices are joining the
startup lottery, where almost all the participants end up worse off
than if they hadn’t played, and being employed, where almost all of
the value you produce will be skimmed off by your employer.  By
contrast, when you write free software, nobody can ever take it away
from you.  In fact, even when <em>other people</em> write free software,
nobody can ever take it away from you.  (By contrast, when other
people write free-in-theory-but-not-in-practice software, it can
totally be taken away from you.  Like if the maintainer decides to
stop supporting your platform, or bundle some kind of adware you
hate.)</p>
<p>Any economically productive activity that you can do with software
becomes more productive when there is more free software out there for
you to draw on.</p>
<h2>The World-Wide Web, for apps</h2>
<p>The Web actually provides us with some tremendously powerful
primitives that simplify a lot of applications, even as they make
others more complicated.  Out of the box, a webapp gets:</p>
<ul>
<li>a gentle learning path;</li>
<li>a typographic layout engine with a relatively powerful box model and
  excellent Unicode support;</li>
<li>image and sound decoding and caching;</li>
<li>alpha compositing;</li>
<li>a hierarchical UI event system;</li>
<li>some degree of incremental relayout;</li>
<li>a high-level reflective prototype-oriented OO language with closures
  and reasonably efficient implementations: JS;</li>
<li>sufficient robustness in the event-driven programming environment
  that your app will probably still mostly work even if some features
  are throwing exceptions;</li>
<li>a vector drawing library that's even easier to write in than
  PostScript, which is saying a lot: SVG;</li>
<li>a compound document system where you can OLEishly embed one document
  in another, including mutually untrusting documents;</li>
<li>a mobile-code system that downloads your webapp once and updates it
  on the client only when it's changed, and potentially only the parts
  that have changed (if you configure your server headers correctly or
  if you use a cache manifest);</li>
<li>by far the best debugging tools I've ever used anywhere: Firebug and
  the Firebug clone that comes with WebKit;</li>
<li>serialization of simple data for free with JSON;</li>
<li>simple persistence (e.g. using localStorage);</li>
<li>a SQL engine (although that's been deprecated);</li>
<li>sending some text over the network to a server in a single line of
  code;</li>
<li>network protocols that provide you fault-tolerance by default as
  long as you obey the REST constraints;</li>
<li>transparent network protocol compression;</li>
<li>a global namespace for remote objects that encompasses the actual
  physical globe, not just your program's "global" namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure that these primitives have a great "strength-to-weight
ratio", in the sense of providing a lot of power for low
implementation complexity, or for that matter even low interface
complexity, but the difference between a JS webapp and, say, a Tk
program to do the same thing is pretty big.</p>
<p>Consider this "microblogging" program in ksh, like a non-networked
version of Twitter:</p>
<pre><code>while read line; do
    ENTRY="$(date +'%d-%m %H:%M:%S'): $line" echo "$ENTRY" &gt;&gt; microb.log
    clear; cat microb.log; echo -n "sup-&gt; "
done
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an equivalent in DHTML, with has better text layout, scrolling,
search, navigation, and editing, and automatically live-upgrades
itself to the latest version of the code after each post, although
it's a bit more code and I think it runs slower:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;var ls = localStorage, d = document;
function add(name, html) { ls[name] = (ls[name] || '') + html }
function esc(text) {return text.replace(/&amp;/g,'&amp;amp;').replace(/&lt;/g,'&amp;lt;');}
d.write(ls['microblog'] || '');&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;form onsubmit="add('microblog',new Date+': '+esc(this.line.value)+'&lt;br&gt;')"&gt;
&lt;input name=line autofocus&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you take out the HTML-escaping code, the DHTML version also has
rich text.</p>
<p>Going back to how we would do things in 1995, a Tcl/Tk version of the
same thing would have to take care of a lot of these things by hand.
I started writing it, in the same ridiculously compressed style as
above:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/wish -f
text .blog; label .sup -text sup; entry .e -textvariable e
pack .blog -side top -fill both -expand true
pack .sup -side left -fill x; pack .e -side left -fill x -expand true
bind .e &lt;Return&gt; blog; proc blog {} {
    global e; .blog insert end "$e\n"; set f [open microb.log w]
    puts $f [.blog get 1.0 end]; close $f; set e ""
}
</code></pre>
<p>XXX include full version</p>
<p>This is still lacking a bunch of things, even compared to the shell
version, including reading the microblog file at startup, not losing
data in machine crashes, making the textarea itself non-editable (?),
adding the dates, focusing the text entry, not being an ugly gray, and
so on.  And this isn't even hitting any of the web's strong points,
like compound documents, networking, garbage collection, or SVG.</p>
<p>If you wanted to replace the web as an application platform --- which
is certainly what both Apple and Google are trying to do with their
respective smartphone operating systems, but also the intent of
platforms like VPRI's STEPS --- you need to understand the strengths
of the platform as well as its excessive complexity.  Some of those
strengths are in fact powerful primitives, like those mentioned above.
Others are more subtle and in fact work against the VPRI vision of an
overall system that is as simple as possible, such as the Principle of
Least Power, the gentle learning path, and View Source.</p>
<h2>Other candidates</h2>
<p>What other powerful primitives might have a high "strength-to-weight
ratio" in a computing system, in the sense of enabling us to build
much more powerful systems with very small amounts of code?</p>
<h3>Content-addressable blob stores for persistent, self-certifying trees</h3>
<p>Traditional Unix-like and MS-DOS-like filesystems provide expandable
virtual disks: "files," which are mutable sequences of bytes,
supporting random-access read and write, plus appending data at the
end.  Instead, a variety of more recent filesystems and related
systems either do not permit modification of existing "files" at all,
or only allow appending to them, and identify stored blobs by using a
one-way hash of their contents; name-to-blob-hash mappings are
typically stored in another blob.  Systems using one or another
variant of this design include the Xanadu Ent, WAFL, Venti, GoogleFS,
FreeNet, Wax, IPFS, Tahoe-LAFS, Bup, Jumprope, Nix/Guix, git-annex,
and most importantly, Git and BitTorrent.</p>
<p>This permits very efficient comparison of filesystem trees and storage
of slightly-modified versions of existing trees, since deep equality
can be performed by an inexpensive shallow equality test, just as with
hash-consed in-memory persistent data structures.</p>
<p>IPFS's author calls this the "Merkle DAG" model: parent nodes link to
their child nodes with secure hashes, just as in a Merkle tree,
without the linearity requirement of the tree.</p>
<p>The one-way-hash "names" are "self-certifying" in the sense that the
mapping from the name to the blob contents can be checked by the
reader, so they do not need to rely on the storage provider.  Another
kind of "self-certifying name" consists of a public key or a one-way
hash of one, although there are tricky issues related to this.</p>
<p>Avery Pennarun (the author of Bup) wrote a very compelling advocacy of
the position that content-hash-addressable blob stores are such a
powerful technology that they invert much of our conventional wisdom
about data storage. XXX link it!</p>
<p>Could you replace most or all of these blob stores with a single blob
store?  Could you provide a single blob-store interface to write your
application software on top of, allowing you to run it against any of
these blob stores?  (Git-annex already kind of contains such a thing
internally.)</p>
<h3>Distributed hash tables</h3>
<p>These are worldwide key-value stores with some degree of resiliency
against malicious participants, and much of the yearly [what is that
thing where Boon Thau Loo published so many papers called?  IPTPS?]
workshops focused on versions of these.  In concert with
self-certifying names, they allow distributed blob stores to have new
blobs added to them, and they allow participants with a common
interest to exchange rendezvous information without depending on a
central server.</p>
<p>The earliest DHT work was "consistent hashing" at Akamai, but later
systems include Chord and Kademlia.  BitTorrent uses a DHT to
bootstrap "trackerless" torrents.</p>
<p>DHTs are mostly only used for decentralized systems (that is, systems
to which it is infeasible for any party to deny access to any other
party), but their failure properties in the face of malicious
participants are not well understood.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use a single DHT implementation for many different
applications?</p>
<h3>Persistent data structures</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, "persistent" has acquired two confusingly similar and
conflicting meanings, both of which have "ephemeral" as their antonym,
because most people are illiterate troglodytes who never venture
outside their cave to see what's happening in the larger world, so
they invent confusingly conflicting terminology.  In this case, I'm
not talking about your program's data surviving restarting it or
restarting your computer (because the data is on disk or something),
but rather data structures which might be in volatile RAM, but which
you don't modify.  Instead, you make new, modified versions of them.
If you use efficient persistent data structures, most of the structure
will be shared.  This is the kind of "persistence" that pertains to
most of the standard data structures in, say, Clojure.</p>
<p>This pretty much requires a garbage collector or its moral equivalent,
like reference counting or a linear type system.  RAII is not going to
help you out here.  This also means you have no idea why your program
is using so much RAM.</p>
<p>There are a few different advantages to persistent data structures
over their "ephemeral" cousins, the kind where you modify them in
place.  One is that they're less bug-prone: no more aliasing bugs
where you passed a dict to some function and then to another function
and then the first function modified it.  Another is that you get
"undo" without any extra complexity in your code.  This is pretty
important if you’re, say, trying to do software transactional memory
(see below) or backtracking.  A third is that if you actually are
using a bunch of different versions of a data structure (like in the
backtracking case) they'll probably use <em>less</em> memory.  A fourth is
that you can access them without locking, and replicate them without
fear (whether across the CPU caches of your different cores or halfway
around the world) so they can give you better efficiency.  (They're a
crucial enabling technology for CRDTs; see below.)  A fifth somewhat
subtle performance point is that, if you <em>are</em> using a garbage
collector, they prevent you from wasting CPU time on its write
barrier, while mutable data structures have you beating on the write
barrier all the time.</p>
<p>I mentioned above that an immutable blob store is in a sense a store
for persistent data structures.  Hopefully that is clearer now.</p>
<p>"Hash consing" is a technique applicable only to persistent data
structures: when asked to create a given data structure, you hash it
to see if it already exists, and if so, return a pointer to the
existing instance rather than making a new copy.  This allows you to
perform deep-equality testing in constant (and small) time.
Content-hash-addressed blob stores provide this feature, but only if
you are careful not to include any extraneous data.</p>
<p>Clojure's standard library already includes a wide variety of
persistent in-RAM data structures that are simple to use and useful to
many applications.  Could these be abstracted so that the same code
also supports distributed and blob-store cases?</p>
<h3>Pub-sub</h3>
<p>Publish-and-subscribe systems, also known as event-based integration
systems or event buses, allow you to connect together
very-loosely-coupled subsystems with real-time notification.  These
are universal in financial institutions, but are also used in systems
at a variety of scales to reduce coupling between modules.</p>
<p>Typically, when a publisher publishes an event on a topic, all the
subscribers to that topic receive a copy of the event, shortly
afterward or possibly not at all.  The publisher is not informed of
the success or failure, and does not know how many subscribers exist.</p>
<p>The use of this technique in user interface programming goes back at
least to MVC in the 1970s, where the model would notify all of its
views that it had changed and they might need to redraw.</p>
<p>As a current and local example, when I save this text file in my
editor, the kernel sends an inotify notification to any processes that
have registered to receive notifications for this file; this can
trigger reindexing it in a full-text-search engine, updating a
filesystem browser window, or output of extra lines from tail -F.  And
of course group chat systems like IRC, Slack, and WhatsApp are a very
direct application of pub-sub; and D-BUS is the center of a modern
Linux desktop, for better or worse, mostly worse.</p>
<p>Usually, these systems are capable of losing messages, because the
desirable decoupling they provide between subscriber and publisher
prevents them from applying backpressure to slow down a publisher who
is publishing messages faster than some subscriber can process them.
(It would, after all, degrade service to all the other subscribers as
well.)  Lampson's Hint that a system must shed load to keep
functioning in the case of overload constrains the overall system to
lose messages in this case; typically this is done by discarding extra
messages at an event-bus-providing server and possibly notifying the
subscriber that messages have been lost.  In cases where the messages
are being used for cache invalidation, recovery typically involves an
expensive re-replication of state.</p>
<p>(Content-addressable blob stores can make re-replication much less
expensive!  So can rolling hashes, mentioned next.)</p>
<p>One particularly simple way to solve that particular problem is to
make each subscription one-shot: to receive another message, you must
renew your subscription.</p>
<p>Windowing systems almost universally support some kind of pub-sub
notification, though sometimes synchronous and even with a reply
capability built in.</p>
<p>Could we replace the wide variety of pub-sub mechanisms in use, often
intertwined with a horrific amount of application-specific policy,
with one or a few pub-sub mechanisms?</p>
<h3>Rolling hashes, or “the rsync algorithm”</h3>
<p>Rsync efficiently discovers duplicate file chunks between two replicas
of a file, even in the face of insertions and deletions, by hashing
one replica of the file by aligned blocks, then computing a "sliding"
or "rolling" hash over all possible blocksize-sized blocks in the
other replica, whatever their alignment or overlap with one another.
This allows it, like magic, to transmit only the missing data over a
(presumably slow) connection, despite not being able to directly
compare the two versions of the file.</p>
<p>This same approach is used by rdiff-backup to efficiently find a small
delta to apply to a potentially large file, as well as by bup (for a
similar purpose), zsync (a replacement for rsync that precomputes the
block hashes on the server side and therefore requires no run-time
computation on the server side, permitting efficient synchronization
from a dumb blob store), Zbackup (an alternative to bup), ssdeep for
computing and recognizing malware signatures, Jigdo, and Jumprope.</p>
<p>Could we support all of these rolling-hash-based applications with a
single distributed data structure?</p>
<h3>Backtracking or nondeterminism</h3>
<p>From the depths of the 1970s, Prolog and SNOBOL come at thee!
Nondeterministic programming is a lot like normal programming, except
that parts of your program can "fail", and then if you've provided an
alternative path, they will take it.  The most everyday version of
this is the regular expression:</p>
<pre><code>decode_pattern = re.compile("(.{11}) (\\d+)&lt;([^&gt;]*)&gt;(\\d+)\n")
</code></pre>
<p>This example, taken from a project I'm working on called Gab, matches
lines like <code>m0oTzNujJpx 6&lt;I=EInw&gt;6\n</code>.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with regular expressions, the "\d+" means "look
for as many digits as possible without making the pattern fail".  If
the pattern fails afterwards, the "\d+" will try matching fewer and
fewer digits, until it can't match any, at which point it will itself
fail.</p>
<p>In one sense, this particular regexp is not a particularly great
example because it's carefully written to be deterministic: it can
never backtrack and then succeed.  If we were to replace the "[^&gt;]<em>"
with ".</em>", so that it could match any string at all and not just a
string that doesn't contain the "&gt;" symbol, then it would start by
matching to the end of the line, then fail since it didn't find a "&gt;"
there, and backtrack until it did find one.  In another sense, this is
a fantastic example of how, in practice, we work very hard to keep the
poor performance of constant backtracking under control when we use
nondeterministic constructs.</p>
<p>Nondeterminism implemented by backtracking is fantastic for parsing:
you write down a program that could <em>generate</em> the language you're
trying to parse, and use nondeterminism to "execute it backwards": try
all the possible paths of execution until you find one, or the one,
that generated the string you're parsing.  PEGs, which are the most
interesting advance in parsing algorithms in a decade or two, have a
very simple semantics in terms of backtracking.  The "packrat"
PEG-parsing algorithm guarantees linear-time parsing by memoizing
partial parsing results.</p>
<p>Database queries are easily conceptualized as nondeterministic
programs.  <code>SELECT FOO.A, BAR.B FROM FOO, BAR WHERE FOO.C = BAR.C AND
BAR.D &gt; 10</code> has a very simple interpretation as a nondeterministic
program.</p>
<p>The everyday "diff" is also easily conceptualized as a
nondeterministic program, but in this case it isn't sufficient to find
<em>some possible</em> set of edits to get from the old version to the new
version; we want <em>the smallest</em> or <em>nearly the smallest</em> set of edits.
And the standard quadratic dynamic-programming LCS algorithm to solve
it can be understood as a way to tame the exponential blowup of
choices with memoization (see below).</p>
<p>There are a large number of different ways to rein in the exponential
complexity blowup that seems inherent to nondeterministic programming,
mostly specific to one or another domain.  Packrat parsing uses
memoization, limited context, and implicit limits on backtracking;
practical Prolog programs use cut; Datalog uses stratified resolution,
which is a lot like memoization; truth-maintenance systems note the
proximate causes of failures; SQL systems use indices and hash and
sort-merge joins; parsing systems in general use lookahead;
regular-expression engines sometimes use DFA compilation, Boyer-Moore
search for constant strings, and tables of the locations of improbable
bytes in the string, and can also use suffix-table indices (see
below); and so on.  It would be very useful to have a unified
framework that avoids all this duplication of mechanism, and moreover
can be applied to make nondeterministic execution in new domains
reasonably efficient without needing to invent another special-case
hack.</p>
<p>Might such a general efficient nondeterministic-computing algorithm
exist?</p>
<h3>Memoization</h3>
<p>Several of the wild exponential nondeterministic domains are tamed by
memoization; in the Packrat case, all the way down to linear time.
(You could also view the lazily-constructed DFA approach to regexps as
being memoization to get linear time.)  Memoization is storing the
arguments and return value to a function in a "memo table" so that
they can be returned next time without recomputing the function.  At
the best of times, it magically makes your program go faster,
sometimes astronomically faster in the presence of recursion.  It is a
kind of computation caching, and it's also central to the
Self-Adjusting Computation paradigm of incremental computation that
I'll mention later.</p>
<p>Memoization in practice can be tricky to win at, due to both false
misses and false hits in the memo table, and also for efficiency
reasons.</p>
<p>False misses occur because the function is being invoked with data
that it does not care about, which is not always obvious; perhaps it
depends not on the exact value of some numeric argument, for example,
but only on the number of digits in it.  This can be fixed by dividing
the function into two functions, one of which reduces the input data
to the necessary, but this modification seems artificial without the
context of memoization.</p>
<p>False hits occur because some data not considered for the memo-table
lookup affects the return value of the function, or because the
function has some other effect.  If the function has arguments that
refer to some mutable data structure, mutating that data structure
between calls to it may affect its results such that you wouldn't want
to reuse the memoized result.</p>
<p>Efficiency is tricky for a variety of reasons.  If the function is a
thin wrapper around some other function, memoizing one or the other of
them will probably give you the benefit of memoizing both of them, at
half the cost.  Looking up the arguments in the memo table can be
expensive if the arguments are large data structures and you aren't
using hash consing.  If the arguments are mutable, you may have to
copy them.  The memo table can use up a lot of memory.  If the
function is rarely or never called twice with the same arguments,
memoizing it will only make it slower.</p>
<p>Under some circumstances it may make sense to share a memo table
across runs of a program or even across a whole distributed system.
Indeed, this is a major function of build systems like <code>make</code> and
<code>ccache</code>, but it could potentially be useful for smaller computations
as well.  I read a paper about using a precomputed distributed memo
table of optimizations to enable absurdly aggressive compiler
optimizations, for example.</p>
<p>Could we provide generally useful memoization with one or a few
memoization mechanisms, orthogonal to rather than mixed into the code
being memoized?</p>
<p>Memoization is closely related to deterministic rebuilding (see
below).</p>
<h3>Monads</h3>
<p>There are already too many tutorials on what monads are, so I would
not try to explain, even if I knew.  I just want to point out that
sometimes you can write a function with one monad in mind (lists, say)
and then run it in another one (for example, backtracking, although in
a lazy language there may not be so much difference).</p>
<p>How often do we write code that is unnecessarily coupled to a single
monad when it could instead be reusable across different monads?</p>
<h3>Constraint solvers and logic programming (like SQL, but more so)</h3>
<p>I think I mentioned this in my original post (XXX did I?):
SAT and SMT solvers are
now powerful enough to replace a fairly wide variety of custom code in
things like compiler optimization.  Maybe they could be the unifying
approach to nondeterminism that I was saying was needed!  I don't know
enough about them, though.</p>
<p>They are also a crucial enabling technology for formal methods: you
can use them to find test cases that will break your program, or prove
that there are no such test cases.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no experience with SAT or SMT solvers, so this
is very speculative!</p>
<p>How widely can we apply SMT solvers to simplify our software?  What’s
the simplest SMT solver that’s efficient enough to be useful in common
cases?</p>
<p>Truth maintenance systems, due to Stallman and Sussman as refined by
Doyle, are a kind of nondeterministic constraint solver that notes
what sets of assumptions have led to inevitable constraint violations
(through a kind of relevancy logic), improving the performance of the
search by large exponential factors by cutting off nonviable search
branches early.</p>
<p>This is a key aspect of modern SAT and SMT solvers.</p>
<p>Prolog was the first logic programming language, introducing
nondeterministic programming, and can be viewed as a kind of
constraint solver.  It led to a lot of excitement in the 1970s and
early 1980s as a general declarative system, but practical Prolog
programs have to intersperse evaluation-strategy information rather
intimately with declarative information in order to achieve usable
levels of efficiency.  Consequently, Prolog and similar systems such
as KL1 failed to fulfill the high hopes many had had for it, and in
particular caused the failure of the Japanese Fifth Generation
Computing Systems project, resulting in part in Japan’s continued
failure of development in the software field.</p>
<p>Will Byrd and his colleagues have been working on a new family of
logic programming languages named Kanren, whose smallest member,
<a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf">μKanren, from 2013</a>, is 39 lines of Scheme, but even miniKanren is
only 265 lines.  A version of miniKanren has been incorporated into
Clojure’s standard library under the name “core.logic”.  miniKanren’s
constraint solving is powerful enough to automatically enumerate, for
example, quines or programs that produce a particular output, and
there is a theorem prover written in a variant called αKanren which
can not only search for a proof for a given theorem, but also the
theorems that can be proved from a given set of postulates, including
theorems matching a particular pattern.</p>
<p>As the old miniKanren page explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KANREN is a declarative logic programming system with first-class
relations, embedded in a pure functional subset of Scheme. The
system has a set-theoretical semantics, true unions, fair
scheduling, first-class relations, lexically-scoped logical
variables, depth-first and iterative deepening strategies. The
system achieves high performance and expressivity without cuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PrecoSAT, <a href="https://github.com/damelang/precosat">Armin Biere’s SAT solver</a>, apparently was a
competitive-performance SAT solver in 2010; it is only about 5300
lines of C++.</p>
<h3>Array languages like APL</h3>
<p>In APL, I can write the following:</p>
<pre><code>D ← A + B × C
</code></pre>
<p>and it can correspond to any of the following in C:</p>
<pre><code>D = A + B * C;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) D[i] = A + B * C[i];
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) D[i] = A + B[i] * C[i];
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) D[i] = A + B[i] * C;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) D[i] = A[i] + B[i] * C;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) D[i] = A[i] + B[i] * C[i];
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) D[i] = A[i] + B * C[i];
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) D[i] = A[i] + B * C;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) for (j = 0; j &lt; m; j++) D[i][j] = A + B * C[i][j];
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) for (j = 0; j &lt; m; j++) D[i][j] = A + B[i] * C[i][j];
</code></pre>
<p>and so on.  That is, not only does the APL code avoid writing the loop
out explicitly; it <em>abstracts over whether there's a loop at all</em>, as
well as how many levels of loop there are, allowing you to use the
same code in the loop case and in the loopless case.</p>
<p>In many cases in C, we would actually write something like this
instead:</p>
<pre><code>int D(int A, int C) {
    return A + B * C;
}
</code></pre>
<p>perhaps using a global constant B, in which case the APL has saved us
the overhead of a function definition --- not only syntactic, but also
mental.  Note that if B stops being a constant, we need to modify the
argument list.</p>
<p>Given how often we find that something we thought was a constant is in
fact a variable, this seems like a potentially very useful decoupling.</p>
<p>Of course, vector languages like APL, Octave, and R are in some sense
very much stuck in the 1960s: you have integer array indices all over
the place, with no safeguard to keep you from accidentally indexing a
nonsensical array with them; no useful garbage collection of indices
is possible; and accidental performance bugs are ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Note also that APL is not capable of interpreting <code>D ← A + B × C</code> as
the following:</p>
<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) for (j = 0; j &lt; m; j++) D[i][j] = A + B[i] * C[j];
</code></pre>
<p>--- a limitation which is, to me, a direct consequence of the
unprincipled and undisciplined hot integer-index action ubiquitous in
array languages.  If the earlier-mentioned varying interpretations are
in fact valuable, this one seems certain to be valuable as well.  But
APL requires us to explicitly call it out as <code>D ← A + B °.× C</code>, since
otherwise it has no way of knowing that the indices of B and C are
semantically orthogonal, unless they happen to be of different
cardinalities, in which case it barfs.</p>
<p>Despite this, it is common for a function written with Python scalars
in mind to work correctly elementwise on parallel Numpy vectors, or
one written for vectors to work correctly on matrices.</p>
<p>I feel that there is a very close connection between these
vector-valued variables and the table-valued variables of SQL, or the
variables in backtracking languages like Prolog which may have some
arbitrary collection of values during a single repeatedly-backtracking
invocation of a predicate (or function, if you’re not in Prolog).
Each of these unusual semantics allows a single statement to be
polysemically interpreted as an operation over an arbitrary-sized
manifold, or just a single point on that manifold, according to
context.</p>
<p>Array languages explicitly expose parallelism that is implicit in
other languages, and they directly provide operations such as
reduction and scan which have nonobviously parallel algorithms
available.  This has driven efforts to distribute array-language
expression evaluation across clusters and to vectorize it on GPUs and
using SIMD instructions.</p>
<p>Despite all this, array languages have serious obstacles in their way:
their effective lack of type-safety makes it difficult for them to
provide useful error messages, or often any error message rather than
a numerically incorrect answer; their unprincipled nature often
converts programming in them into puzzle-solving, and limits the
dimensional decoupling that is achieved in practice; and their
potential for brevity is a seductive but fatal temptation.  To use
them effectively, you more or less have to represent your data with
parallel arrays, and those are unfashionable nowadays in part because
of the lack of type-safety mentioned above, but also due to
ever-present consistency bugs under update and clumsy support for
dynamic and local allocation.</p>
<p>(I have an unfinished essay coming up where I compare and contrast the
dominant memory models of programming languages, which conveniently
all can be identified with one or another programming language from
the 1950s: FORTRAN’s parallel arrays, COBOL’s nested records, and
Lisp’s object graphs.  Array languages are firmly in the FORTRAN camp,
although Numpy has been adding record types.)</p>
<p>Is there a formulation of array languages that would be broadly useful
to many different applications, including exposing hardware
parallelism in an easy-to-use form, without compromising the
comprehensibility of the application code?</p>
<h3>Probabilistic programming systems</h3>
<p>We can treat parsing by nondeterministic backtracking as attempting to
simulate the execution of a program that could have generated the
string we are trying to parse, conditional on the actual contents of
the string --- we backtrack when the output conflicts with an
observation.  Probabilistic programming systems are a generalization of this
paradigm, or from the other side, a generalization of hidden Markov
models: we begin with a prior probability distribution in the
variables that we are trying to estimate, and we update it according
to observations of the actual facts.</p>
<p>A recent paper in the area by Kulkarni improves the state of the art
in certain difficult computer vision problems, and matches it in
others, by estimating the probability distribution in a simple
probabilistic image-generation program:
<a href="https://mrkulk.github.io/www_cvpr15/1999.pdf">https://mrkulk.github.io/www_cvpr15/1999.pdf</a></p>
<p>There are a number of probabilistic programming languages now
available, but I've never tried any of them.  Could you use some kind
of probabilistic computing system to replace backtracking
nondeterminism in general?  Does it have a hope of being efficient?
(This seems to be what Oleg Kiselyov and Yukiyoshi Kameyama did by
implementing a logic-programming system using Oleg’s
probabilistic-programming system Hansei, in their paper “Rethinking
Prolog”.)</p>
<p>Could you avoid coding the Viterbi algorithm for HMMs?</p>
<p>miniKanren (see above, also written by Oleg, among others)
has been extended to probabilistic logic
programming as probKanren, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo evaluation.</p>
<h3>Incremental or self-adjusting computation</h3>
<p>Umut Acar's self-adjusting computation algorithm is a mechanical
transformation you can apply to a batch algorithm to get an
incremental algorithm (one which, given a set of changes in its
inputs, propagates them to changes in its outputs) that is in many
cases optimally asymptotically efficient.  He uses ubiquitous
memoization of a CPS-transformed version of the program, I think with
hash consing, to do this, and uses a "virtual clock" to ensure that
side effects do not invalidate the memoization when re-executing
functions whose inputs have changed.  (I think.  I haven't managed to
finish his dissertation yet.)</p>
<p>That is, the idea is that you run the transformed algorithm once to
get its output, and then to update the output for a changed input, you
re-execute only the parts of the program that are affected by the
changed input.  He's demonstrated speedups over the raw batch
algorithm of several orders of magnitude, in exchange for a slowdown
of a factor of 5 or so while running the trace of the initial
execution.</p>
<p>Hammer has been extending this work, and Jane Street recently
published their implementation of SAC for OCaml:
<a href="https://blogs.janestreet.com/introducing-incremental/">https://blogs.janestreet.com/introducing-incremental/</a></p>
<p>This is a very interesting kind of decoupling: your code is decoupled
from whether it is being used to compute the entire output or only a
change to it.  This is potentially very useful not only for efficiency
but also for debugging ("What parts of the program would change their
results if this input changed?", leading to "What part of the input
affected this part of the output?") and for dynamic program dataflow
analysis in general.  You could imagine using such an execution trace
to replace a scalar input with a vector, as in the array-languages
item above, and to rapidly provide feedback to optimization algorithms
which want to know which input changes will improve their utility
function.</p>
<p>Can we apply this kind of incrementalization to programs that were
written without it in mind, as a compiler for nonstandard semantics?
(I think that's been done!)  Does it subsume backtracking, if the
decisions taken at nondeterministic backtrack points are treated as
input?  Can we do all of this efficiently without using tens of
gigabytes of RAM, perhaps by making more judicious choices of what to
memoize?</p>
<h3>Fully homomorphic encryption</h3>
<p>A lot of effort has gone into developing very clever cryptographic
protocols to protect parties from one another in ways that would not
be needed if they were willing to rely on the integrity of a common
“trusted entity”, traditionally called “Trent”, because any person or
machine you nominate as Trent is in fact corruptible.  As Szabo
explains [XXX], FHE allows you to collectively create a “virtual
Trent” that carries out any agreed-upon computation whose correctness
and confidentiality all participating parties can verify.</p>
<p>That is, if you have a practical FHE protocol, that protocol would
subsume essentially all cryptographic protocols, in theory.</p>
<p>The problem now is how to make FHE sufficiently efficient to be
practical for anything.</p>
<h3>Convergent replicated data types</h3>
<p>Also known as “CRDTs”.</p>
<p>Eventually-consistent databases have been a topic of some interest
ever since some PARC work in the 1990s argued that ACID was wrong for
many applications, although of course Lotus Notes was an
eventually-consistent database since its inception in the early 1980s.
Interest in them exploded after Eric Brewer's CAP conjecture (later
theorem), which showed precisely how high the price of ACID was, and
about half of the NoSQL fad, including the influential Amazon Dynamo
paper, which I STILL haven't read, was an exploration of the
eventually-consistent design space.</p>
<p>The problem is that with Notes, or Riak, or the git plumbing, the
database doesn't reach consistency on its own.  It just tells you that
you have a conflict and you need to resolve it.  It's up to your
application code (in the case of git, the porcelain) to resolve the
conflict, and probably in some cases to throw itself upon the user's
mercy so they can resolve the conflict.  Even if the application
contains ad-hoc application-specific code to resolve the conflict,
that code usually gets tested pretty rarely, and it's not at all
unusual to have subtle bugs in it that will sometimes resolve a given
conflict incorrectly.</p>
<p>CRDTs are a way of resolving update conflicts between different
replicas that come with proofs of convergence: if your application (or
database!) uses a CRDT algorithm to update a particular replicated
data store, the merging process is guaranteed to always converge,
always to the same state regardless of the order of merge operations,
and generally without losing any data (although that depends on which
CRDT!)  That is to say, “eventually consistent” becomes an automatic
guarantee, not a statement of hope.</p>
<p>CRDTs offer an automatic way of replicating data to keep it available
in the face of node or network failure while compromising consistency
guarantees to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>A very simple CRDT which is foundational to most of the others is a
set or bag to which things can only be added, not removed.
Conflicting updates are simply resolved by taking the union.</p>
<h3>AI optimization algorithms</h3>
<p>SAT is, in a sense, the problem of inverting a Boolean function.  You
have a big propositional expression, which you know evaluates to true;
you want to know what the values of the variables in it are, or at
least whether there is any possible set of values for those variables.
Similarly, nondeterministic and probabilistic computation can be
viewed as other function-inverting problems.</p>
<p>Optimization algorithms solve a related problem: they are trying, more
or less, to <em>approximately</em> invert a <em>black-box</em> function, a function
whose behavior we hope is in some sense orderly.  This is harder than
SAT because we don't get to look at the code for the function, but
also easier because the algorithm gets some indication of how close it
is.</p>
<p>(Actually they're usually trying to maximize or minimize the
function.)</p>
<p>There's a whole huge family of numerical optimization algorithms from
AI: random sampling is the simplest, of course, but then you have
hill-climbing (gradient descent), the simplex method for linear parts
of the problem, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and so on.
If you relax the black-box constraint and make your function
differentiable (see automatic differentiation below), gradient descent
becomes enormously easier, and the possibility of using something like
Newton's Method to try to find zeroes opens up.  And, since
optimization typically involves re-executing the same code repeatedly
with slightly different inputs, self-adjusting computation may be able
to speed it up by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>It is very common for it to be easy to evaluate the goodness of a
solution to a problem, but algorithmically tricky to efficiently find
a good solution.  Consider the particle-system text layout algorithm
Alan Kay was so excited about in VPRI STEPS --- wouldn't it be better
to just specify what a good paragraph layout looks like, then search
for one, as TeX does?  Photogrammetry, structure-from-motion, point
cloud coregistration, G-code planning for a 3-D printer, image
dithering, lossy image or audio compression, lossless compression,
edit-sequence computation (text diffing), place and route --- all of
these are problems that can be easily cast into the numerical
optimization mold.</p>
<p>Michał Zalewski’s <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/aspmisc/intervalgraph">afl-fuzz</a> combines genetic algorithms with
compile-time instrumentation (see below) of object code programs to
search through their execution paths, with the primary objective of
finding bugs that lead to crashes, but has demonstrated the capability
to generate valid SQL statements and JPEG files by probing SQLite and
libjpeg.</p>
<p>How much can we abstract out these optimization algorithms to decouple
them from the details of particular problems we are solving with them?
How much code could we avoid writing if we can simply provide a
computable utility function to optimize and apply a generic
optimization algorithm to it?  Can we make that more efficient by
automatically incrementalizing or differentiating it?  What's the
relationship between SMT solvers and optimization algorithms?</p>
<h3>Graph search algorithms</h3>
<p>A* search is a provably-optimal graph-shortest-path algorithm, which
takes an “admissible” heuristic to possibly improve its choices,
usually allowing it to beat the heck out of Dijkstra's algorithm in
performance.  If the heuristic is admissible but not useful (for
example, always returning 0), it decays to Dijkstra's algorithm in the
worst case.  It's commonly used for pathfinding in video games, and
commonly with an inadmissible heuristic, which can cause it to find
suboptimal paths.  <a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">Amit Patel has a fantastic presentation of it</a>.</p>
<p>Many search problems can be conceptualized as graph search (or tree
search, since a tree is just a graph that is sparsely connected in a
certain way).  It’s necessary that the choices be discrete, or
discretizable.</p>
<p>What’s the relationship between A<em> and the optimization algorithms
discussed in the previous section?  Can you use A</em> search efficiently
for problems like dithering an image or superoptimizing a basic block?</p>
<h3>Particle filters</h3>
<p>Particle filters attempt to approximate an evolving continuous
probability distribution by sampling it with hypotheses or “particles”
that concentrate in the more probable parts of the space under the
information you have so far, allowing multimodal probability
distributions.  Probably one of the various demos of this dynamical
process on the web is better than some text at explaining it.</p>
<p>Particle filters are currently being successfully applied to a variety
of hard perceptual or inference problems, including beat-tracking in
music, motion-tracking in video, robot localization from noisy sensor
data in confusing environments, 3-D object tracking, and automatic
electrical fault diagnosis.</p>
<p>The same “importance sampling” mechanism used by particle filters also
underlies some probabilistic programming systems (see above); for
random variables drawn from a continuous distribution, even the random
continuous drift that allows particle filters to explore points nearby
in a continuous space might be useful.</p>
<p>XXX I should probably see if I can find people relating these two
things to each other and make sure my understanding of the terms is
right.</p>
<p>What else can we use particle filters for?  Software-defined radio
filtering, clearly: the frequency, phase, and direction both of the
desired signal and of the loudest sources of nearby-frequency
interference should be quite amenable to particle-filter estimation.</p>
<h3>Transparent persistence, or single-level store</h3>
<p>This is the other kind of persistence: storing your data on disk.  If
you’ve programmed an AS/400 or Squeak or run things inside VirtualBox
(see virtual machines, below), you already know what this is like: you
need to explicitly separate your long-term persistent data from your
ephemeral data in order to support code upgrade, but you don’t need to
make that separation just in order to not lose data when you turn the
machine off.</p>
<p>Transparent persistence allows you to build a computing system without
building a filesystem, and it supports fault recovery and process
migration, and in particular it simplifies reasoning about capability
systems, but it puts some extra demands on other parts of your system.
Random number generators (like /dev/urandom) are not secure after
restoring the system state from a snapshot (see below about
snapshots).  Your garbage collector needs to be comfortable with the
idea that you have terabytes of data.</p>
<p>Without snapshots (see below), transparent persistence on
spinning-rust disks poses certain problems of consistency: disk
operations just before a power outage may have been reordered and some
arbitrary subset of them may be lost.  There’s no guarantee that, when
the machine reboots, the on-disk state will be consistent.</p>
<p>This particular powerful primitive is in no way new, forming as it
does the bedrock of Lisp, Smalltalk, and AS/400 systems since the
1970s.  In those systems, it does simplify some aspects of software,
but it may be that it is a feature that doesn’t pay its own complexity
cost, except when used to implement features you can get no other way.
Part of the problem is that most of the difficulty of persistence is
not, in fact, the need to write serialization and deserialization
code, but rather the need to distinguish irreplaceable data from
dispensable data and to carry forward the irreplaceable data to new
versions of the software.  Rails migrations and Spark RDDs (see
“deterministic rebuilding”, below) may turn out to be bigger advances
in persistence than single-level stores were.</p>
<h3>Ropes</h3>
<p>Lots of programs manipulate lots of strings, some spend most of their
time manipulating strings, and network packets and the current states
of disk files, memory regions, entire disks, and all of memory are
also strings.  With the usual terminated or counted array string
representations, every string operation implicitly takes a potentially
unbounded amount of CPU time, and many common operations, like
replacing characters in the middle of a large string and appending
large strings, do in practice take significant amounts of CPU time.
And the standard string representation is not persistent (in the
functional-programming sense; see above).</p>
<p>There’s a heavier-weight representation of strings called “ropes”
which <em>is</em> persistent, and in which most common operations are
logarithmic-time or constant-time; in particular, concatenation is
usually constant-time, although this varies a bit.  A rope is either
an immutable array of bytes (or characters), a concatenation of two or
more ropes, implemented with pointers to them, or sometimes a pure
function that can be invoked to retrieve characters within that range.
You need to memoize (see above) subtree lengths to ensure that
indexing is logarithmic-time.  With hash consing, ropes enable string
comparison to be done in constant time, too, which is particularly
beneficial for memoization (see above).  (I think rolling hashes are
necessary and sufficient to make hash consing of ropes efficient.)</p>
<p>This is useful for two reasons: first, because string manipulation is
<em>so</em> expensive that we add a lot of complexity to our program designs
in order to avoid it, and ropes may offer the opportunity to avoid
that; and, second, because memoization is a very-broadly-applicable
optimization.</p>
<p>Jumprope and bup are two rope-based storage systems that store their
nodes in content-addressable block stores (see above) using rolling
hashes (see above).  Rope-based disk storage is particularly helpful
for machine state snapshots (see below) which are often large, with a
great deal in common with previous versions of the snapshot.</p>
<p>Erlang uses a very minimal kind of rope for I/O, called “IO lists”:
the various byte output routines accept "IO lists", defined as either
a "binary" (Erlang blob), a byte, a Unicode binary, a Unicode
character, or a cons of IO lists.  This gives it constant-time
concatenation among strings destined for output, which is enough to
make it very fast at generating network packets.</p>
<p>I’ve started working on a non-persistent (in the functional sense: not
immutable) variant of rope I call “cuerda”, which I think has the
potential to replace not just native string types but also
filesystems, editor buffers, and most parse trees, including things
like the accursed DOM.  (I would prefer it to be persistent, but I
haven’t found a reasonably efficient way to provide certain other
functionality I deem essential on persistent ropes.)</p>
<p>In a sense, WAFL and other modern filesystems like it are
ropes-for-storage, although they usually embody tree structures, not
simple linear strings.</p>
<p>XXX mention stratified B-trees?</p>
<p>What if some kind of rope were the normal kind of string, and also
your filesystem?  Could that simplify the whole system?  (With a
single-level store (see above), they could be the very same tree
structure, although that might be undesirable for performance reasons
on spinning rust, due to how it demands much more locality.)</p>
<h3>Snapshots of state, ephemeral and durable</h3>
<p>Unix creates new processes with the <code>fork()</code> system call, which
results in two processes that are identical in nearly every way, each
with its own private virtual memory space.  This used to be a fairly
slow operation, especially before 3BSD, when it involved physically
copying the process’s entire memory space.  However, modern Linux
machines can carry it out thousands or even tens of thousands of times
per second, because the virtual memory mappings are merely marked
copy-on-write.</p>
<p>afl-fuzz <a href="http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/fuzzing-binaries-without-execve.html">takes advantage of this efficiency</a> to test thousands of
random test inputs per second.  OCaml’s debugger uses the same
facility in its debugger to “freeze” process execution at various
points in the past, allowing you to step time <em>backwards</em> as well as
forwards.</p>
<p>Similarly, QEMU, VirtualBox, and Xen support freezing the entire state
of a virtual machine (see below), including its display, memory, and
virtual devices, allowing you to back up to that checkpoint and resume
execution from it later.  <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~billm/memoize.html" title="Broken link.">Emacs does the same thing</a> to speed up
startup; Squeak and other image-based Smalltalk systems do the same,
as mentioned above under “transparent persistence”.  Xen’s “Remus”
feature maintains a continuously-updated snapshot of the entire
virtual-machine state on a remote machine, so that in the case of a
hardware failure, you can continue executing on the remote machine
without rebooting.</p>
<p>WAFL avoided (avoids?) filesystem corruption on power loss by only
committing internally-consistent snapshots of the filesystem to
spinning rust, once per second; as a bonus, the snapshots share
storage, and so old snapshots are accessible.  This permits safely
backing up a consistent snapshot of an active RDBMS transactional
store.  The same functionality is provided by ZFS, ext3fs jbd, and
various LVM systems, which can be used as layers underneath other
filesystems and transactional stores to ensure that recovery to a
consistent state is possible, both after a power failure and after a
failed system upgrade.</p>
<p>Git, of course, snapshots the source files it controls in your
repository as a commit, storing them in its Merkle DAG in its
content-addressed blob store (see above), which in turn is a CRDT (see
above).  Nix is a package manager and Linux distribution (with a
GNU/Linux variant called Guix) that uses the same approach for
configurations of installed software.</p>
<p>Some caution is needed: although snapshotting automatically converts
ephemeral data structures (in the functional-programming sense) to
persistent ones, they may not be <em>efficient</em> persistent ones, either
in time or in space.  If you’re appending to an amortized-constant-
time growable buffer, for example, and you snapshot its state just
before it reallocates to twice the size and then repeatedly replay
forward from that snapshot, it will rapidly become inefficient.  And
if you’re snapshotting an object that references mutable objects, you
need some way to convert them to immutable objects (and back to
mutable objects when you revivify them), which generally involves
copying, spending both space and time.</p>
<p>What if you could efficiently snapshot any part of your running
system, ephemeral or persistent, at any time, and freeze it and
possibly duplicate it for later?  Could you implement this efficiently
for mutable object graphs with help from the garbage collector’s write
barrier?  How broadly could you apply this principle?  (Maybe you
could use this feature to implement the clone() operation for a
prototype-based object system.)  If you apply it to real-time mutable
data structures, do you get guaranteed-efficient persistent data
structures?  What if you had Git for in-memory objects?  What if all
your software and data could be frozen and easily migrated between
low-power handheld devices and more powerful laptops, or incrementally
between data centers?</p>
<h3>Virtual machines</h3>
<p>Unix processes are virtual machines, although their I/O architecture
is not borrowed from any physical machines.  Unfortunately, they have
access to so much system-wide state that it is often inconvenient to
do what you want to do inside the confines of a single process; and
there are programs you may want to run that are written using some
other I/O architecture.</p>
<p>Whole-machine or near-whole-machine emulation, as with QEMU,
VirtualBox, or Xen, is now a common system administration technique
again, as it was in the 1960s; it allows you to snapshot the machine
state (see above), to pause the machine’s execution, to migrate it to
a different host, to restart it from a snapshot, and to indirect its
I/O through some virtual device.  It’s still very computationally
expensive.  In the other direction, chroot and similar process-
isolation mechanisms in Linux and FreeBSD are being beefed up, with
things like Docker and the Nix/Guix isolated build environment (see
below about deterministic rebuilding) to allow them to do more of what
whole-machine emulation does.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interestingly, MirageOS is a set of libraries for
building “operating systems” that are really just application
processes, running bare on top of a Xen or similar hypervisor, thus
reducing the security attack surface of your system by eliminating the
operating system’s TCP/IP stack, and allowing a transition to an
overall simpler operating environment to proceed incrementally rather
than all at once.  You could imagine running a self-contained simple
system like Squeak or Oberon under a hypervisor like Xen,
communicating with a Linux guest to run legacy applications such as
Chrome.  Qubes is an OS project using an approach like this one to
improve Linux security.  (Unfortunately, Xen still relies on Linux
drivers to handle the hardware.)</p>
<p>Virtual-machine emulation also provides crucial debugging capabilities
that dramatically accelerate the first steps in the development of new
operating system kernels, and potentially the debugging or analysis of
existing ones.  Back in the 1990s, the “spa” SPARC Performance
Analyzer was a very slow virtual-machine emulator that was used to
deeply examine the execution of processes on a simulated SPARC, in
some cases using techniques similar to compile-time instrumentation.</p>
<p>(Virtual machines also have potential uses in information archival: a
well-defined virtual-machine specification with emulators written in
it capable of running other software could enable the recovery of lost
software and the file formats implemented by that software.  Such a
fictional scenario, centered around the “UM-32 Universal Machine”, was
the premise for the ICFP 2006 Programming Contest.)</p>
<p>Historically, we have often introduced virtual machine instruction
sets not modeled on any physical CPU for a variety of reasons,
including improving debuggability, allowing compilers to run their
code on new machines without retargeting (the original excuse for the
JVM, ridiculous now that HotSpot is much larger than javac),
efficiently supporting operations not supported by the underlying
machine (in the case of the WAM, for example), and stuffing more
program code into limited memory (the reason for the Excel bytecode
interpreter, the BASIC Stamp bytecode, the Microsoft BASIC-80, and to
a significant extent, Smalltalk-80).  You could imagine in particular
that a snapshot of a system could be more useful if it were portable
between CPU architectures, allowing you to migrate running
applications between your cellphone and your server, but I’m not aware
of anyone having done this.</p>
<p>Probably introducing new virtual CPU architectures will not simplify a
computing system.  At this point, instead of emitting bytecode, you
should probably emit machine code for a common CPU, like i386, x86-64,
ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, or maybe MMIX or RISC-V, and run it under an
emulator for that CPU if necessary.  You can emit really dumb machine
code, and it will still run faster and be simpler than emitting and
interpreting bytecode.  This also has the advantage that someone else
has probably already written an efficient implementation of your
“bytecode machine” for most popular architectures out there, and you
can use object-code instrumentation and analysis to add new features
either to code built with your own system or existing code.</p>
<p>But maybe I’m wrong and there is some possible system simplification,
even today, from designing an abstract virtual machine.</p>
<h3>Automatic dependency tracking and deterministic rebuilding</h3>
<p><code>make</code> is the standard Unix utility for avoiding unnecessary
recompilation by memoization (see above), but it requires you to
explicitly and statically specify the dependencies of each build
target, and it almost invariably omits dependencies like the compiler
executable itself and the Makefile rule.</p>
<p>Meteor is a JavaScript framework in which you run your presumably
deterministic “computations” in a sort of transaction (see below about
transactions) that tracks what they read and write, intermediating
their access to a remote database.  Then, if there is a change in any
of the things they read (probably because some other computation wrote
to it), they can re-execute your computation.  This automatically
detects the things that could have changed the result of your
computation, using exactly the same mechanism as Composable Memory
Transactions.  In this way, you can construct a reactive dataflow
computation with dynamic topology without ever explicitly specifying
dependencies, and as long as your computation accesses no data that
Meteor cannot audit access to.</p>
<p>Debian, Nix, Guix, and the Tor Project are using a similar approach to
get reproducible compilation products from possibly unreliable
compilation machines: by knowing all of the inputs to the compilation
process, including the compiler executable, they can detect and
recover from a compilation process on one machine producing incorrect
executables, either due to bugs or due to attackers attempting to
inject malicious code.  Generally these reproducible-build systems
identify the compilation inputs with a secure hash and store them in a
content-addressed blob store.</p>
<p>This reproducibility also makes it possible to memoize the compilation
process (see above about memoization), avoiding actual runs of the
compiler that are not motivated either to verify reproducibility or
because the inputs have changed.  Vesta and ccache are two systems
that work this way.</p>
<p>(Acar’s Self-Adjusting Computation also, in some sense, works the same
way, at a much finer granularity.)</p>
<p>ccache even automatically tracks compiler inputs the way Meteor does,
as does <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~billm/memoize.html" title="Broken link.">Bill McCloskey’s memoize</a> (<a href="https://github.com/kgaughan/memoize.py">now on GitHub</a>), which uses
strace and is therefore slow.  <a href="http://cr.yp.to/redo.html">redo</a>, implemented by Avery
Pennarun, tracks inputs comprehensively and dynamically (like Meteor)
but not automatically.</p>
<p>Apache Spark is a system for scalable cluster computation which
deterministically computes “RDDs” either from stored input files or
other RDDs, and which records the “lineage” of each RDD, which is to
say, all the inputs that went into creating it; this enables RDDs, or
parts of RDDs, to be recomputed in the case of machine failure.</p>
<p>RDBMSes do automatic dependency tracking to automatically update
indexes and, if supported, materialized views.  However, I think
RDBMSes typically use a different technique, which I’m calling
algebraic incremental updates (see below), rather than rebuilding
parts of an index or view from scratch when they have been
invalidated.  If simple rebuilding could be made adequately efficient,
which is kind of what Acar's self-adjusting computation claims, maybe
RDBMSes wouldn’t need to support algebraic incremental updates.</p>
<p>This kind of automatic dependency tracking could dramatically improve
the efficiency of snapshots (see above): anything that could be
automatically rebuilt does not need to be included in the snapshot,
and indeed that is how we manage our source code repositories.</p>
<p>If previous build outputs are stored in a distributed cache, they
typically are stored in their entirety, perhaps compressed.  However,
they are often very similar to one another.  Using a
rolling-hash-based system like bup or Jumprope could conceivably allow
the storage of orders of magnitude more cached build outputs, which
could be a useful alternative to finer-grained dependency tracking
like SAC.</p>
<p>A common performance problem in C and especially C++ compilation is
header-file parsing; due to recursive <code>#include</code> lines, it is common
for a single source file to include tens or hundreds of megabytes of
header files, which must all be tokenized.  A common approach to this
problem in the past has been to add “precompiled header” support to
the compiler, which serializes the state of the compiler to the
filesystem at some predetermined point, and then attempts to use the
serialized state only when it is safe to do so.  This tends to be
bug-prone.  A possible alternative would be to snapshot the compiler’s
runtime state several times per second during the compilation,
annotating the snapshot with the set of inputs so far consumed; then,
when a rebuild is called for, the old inputs can be compared to the
new inputs, and the previous compiler run can be resumed from the last
snapshot which had not yet read any changed data.  This will not speed
up the compilation of one C source file using data from the
compilation of another (except perhaps in the sense that the snapshots
could share space due to after-the-fact substring deduplication in
storage), since the compiler receives the differing command lines
immediately on startup, but it will speed up the recompilation of
modified files, potentially by a much larger factor than mere
precompiled headers.</p>
<p>A totally different alternative way to avoid precompiled headers would
be to parallelize the tokenization process using a parallel prefix-sum
algorithm; a third approach would be to make the token stream itself
memoizable, so that you only need to retokenize any given header file
when the header file itself or something it <code>#include</code>s changes.</p>
<h3>Prefix sum, cumsum, or scan</h3>
<p>The prefix-sum problem is to compute, say, 1 3 6 10 15 21 from
1 2 3 4 5 6, or 32 5 1 32 1 from 32 -27 -4 31 -31, or using max
instead of addition, 1 2 2 4 4 4 4 8 from 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 8; each output
item depends on all the input items at its position or earlier, but
the associativity of the operation used to combine them allows the use
of a variety of efficient parallel algorithms to compute it in
logarithmic time.  This means that if you can cast your problem into
the format of a prefix-sum with some associative operation, you can
more than likely get reasonable parallelism out of it.</p>
<p>Now, note that function composition is associative!  It might seem
that this would allow you to simulate any sequential process in
logarithmic time on a parallel machine, but in fact that is only the
case if you have a bounded-space representation of the transition
function over an arbitrarily long period.  For example, if you're
concatenating millions of 3x3 matrices or simulating a 20-state
Levenshtein automaton (or a lexer) over a gigabyte of text, this
approach does indeed work!  But for, say, parallelizing the execution
of a virtual machine, it probably won't.</p>
<p>Prefix sums are included in APL and some other array languages as a
fundamental operation, called "scan", "\", or "cumsum", but in some of
these languages, it is not applicable to arbitrary associative binary
operations.</p>
<p>One of the standard parallel prefix-sum algorithms recursively builds a
segment tree over the input array; if memoized, this provides an
efficient logarithmic-time lazy incremental algorithm, even when the
operation in question does not admit inverses (the common examples
being max, min, or associative bitwise operations.)  The same segment
tree can then be used for the range-minimum-query problem and its
variants, even though RMQ is more general than the problem of
returning an item from min-scan problem (since the range being queried
need not start at the beginning of the vector).</p>
<p>(If the operation does admit inverses, you can instead incrementalize
it using algebraic incremental updates; see below.)</p>
<p>This is a generally applicable strategy for incrementalizing
algorithms expressible as prefix sums.  For example, if you use a
finite state machine to syntax-highlight an editor buffer or
conservatively approximate a CFG parse, you can build a segment tree
of state mappings over substrings of the input, which allows you to
update the entire output in logarithmic time after localized changes
to the input, such as edits to an editor buffer.</p>
<p>One of the standard applications for the plain-vanilla addition
version of prefix sum is to rapidly compute box filters, also known as
simple moving averages, sometimes as an alternative to mipmapping of
images and in other DSP applications.  They can also be used to
calculate arbitrary linear IIR filters.</p>
<h3>PID control</h3>
<p>PID control is a fairly general linear control algorithm to push a
system in the direction of the state you want.  You exert a push that
is a weighted sum of three components: the difference between the
desired and actual state (the Proportional component), one that is the
Integral of the difference in order to correct offset errors, and one
that is the Derivative (or differential) of the current state in order
to damp oscillations which would otherwise result from the other two
components in the presence of hysteresis or phase delay in the system.</p>
<p>PID control is very widely used in the control of physical machinery
in industry by microcontrollers or PLCs and even pneumatic controllers
and analog circuits.</p>
<p>(Hmm.  Maybe this is not actually that powerful?)</p>
<h3>String similarity</h3>
<p>useful for compression, virus scanning</p>
<h3>Suffix arrays</h3>
<p>A suffix array of a string is a permutation of the indices into that
string, sorted so that the suffixes of the string starting at those
indices are lexicographically sorted.  Any particular chunk of a
suffix array lists the places in the string that a given substring
occurs, lexicograhically sorted by what’s after it.  (Well, maybe a
range of substrings.)  It's a lot like a KWIC index, except that it is
fully comprehensive.</p>
<p>Suffix arrays are a simplification of suffix tries, such as Patricia
trees (I've never been entirely clear on whether Patricia trees are a
particular kind of suffix trie, or just another name for suffix
tries).  Once you have computed a suffix array for a corpus of text,
there are a variety of queries you can execute efficiently on it: all
occurrences of a given substring, the probability distribution of
characters that <em>follow</em> a given substring, all matches of a
particular regular expression, all approximate matches of a given
string (using a Levenshtein automaton), and so on.  As you can
imagine, this is useful for data compression, and, indeed, the
Burrows-Wheeler Transform used in bzip2 is suffix-array-based.  Suffix
arrays themselves are large compared to the text they describe (N log
N bits for an N-character text, so commonly 5 or 6 bytes per byte of
text) but there are suffix-array-based things I don't understand
called “compressed indexes”, such as the FM-index, which represent a
text in a compressed form and support both decompression and efficient
search operations on it efficiently.</p>
<p>Historically, suffix-array construction was very computationally
expensive, which is one of he main reasons bzip2 is slow.  But now
there are new suffix-array construction algorithms (SA-IS, the skew
algorithm, and a third one which I think is called SA-IR) that are
linear in time and use a reasonably small amount of memory, like, less
than twice the space of the final result.</p>
<p>This linear-time (“O(N)”) bound is particularly intriguing since
comparison-based sorts have a proven (?) complexity bound of
O(N log N) time.  It turns out that there is no contradiction: to have
N distinct keys, each key needs to occupy at least log₂ N bits, so
O(N log N) comparison sorting can actually be O(N) in the total size
of the database.</p>
<p>Often, though, it isn’t!  So suffix-array construction could
conceivably be an absolute performance win as well as a simplifying
tool.</p>
<p>Most database sorting, indexing, and search problems are in some sense
a subset of the substring-search problem.</p>
<p><strong>Field search with suffix arrays</strong>: If a record has the string
“CA2777697A1” in the field “patentnumber”, most representations of it
will also contain “CA2777697A1” as a substring, and probably not very
many other records will.  Indeed, with appropriate choices of
encoding, you can ensure that, for example, the string
“&amp;patentnumber=CA2777697A1&amp;” will occur exactly and only in the
representation of records with that string as the value of that field.
This extends in an obvious way to prefix (<code>patentnumber like 'CA27%'</code>)
queries and range (<code>year between '1972' and '1977'</code>) queries, although
multi-column indices can only be emulated in this way if the column
sequence is a substring of a column sequence strictly observed in the
representation of every record.  On the other hand, this gives you
N(N-1)/2 multi-column indices on N columns out of the box for free, if
your table is in 1NF and you observe this ordering constraint, as well
as suffix searches: <code>patentnumber like '%7A1'</code>.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to do full-text fielded search in this way by using
regular expression search (<code>/&amp;body=[^&amp;]*Argentina/</code>) but I don’t
expect that to be very efficient.  It’s probably better to do
full-text fielded search in some other way, such as by doing a
full-text unfielded search and then examining each result to see if
it’s in the right field, or if that’s inefficient, by concatenating
the desired field into a separate corpus.</p>
<p>(This approach, without the suffix arrays, was the basis of the cult
PC database program askSam in the 1980s, 1990s, and into the 2000s:
its “records” were free-form text; a “field” was just a field name
followed by square brackets with text within, like
<code>patentnumber[CA2777697A1     ]</code>; and it used a full-text index to
support fielded search. askSam is still around, though somewhat less
popular than before.)</p>
<p>askSam was more like what we call a “document database” nowadays, like
MongoDB; its records were not in 1NF.</p>
<p><strong>Record sorting with suffix arrays</strong>: clearly if you want to sort the
“patentnumber”-containing records in the above table by patentnumber,
you can simply look at the chunk of the suffix array for strings
beginning with “&amp;patentnumber=”, and find the beginning of the record
each such substring falls within.  If you insist on ordering strings
like “X”, “X%”, and “Xa” in that order, you can change the delimiter
from “&amp;” to ASCII NUL.  I suspect that using magical “out-of-band”
“bytes” as delimiters is the easiest way to get this kind of thing to
work correctly, although it’s no doubt possible to devise an escaping
scheme that preserves collating order and allows this sort of reliable
substring testing to find field boundaries.  (All three of the
practical linear-time suffix-array algorithms cope well with odd-sized
alphabets, and in fact use them internally.  Probably the best way to
represent the out-of-band values in memory is by storing a list of
their indices.)</p>
<p>In the Canon Cat, Jef Raskin suggested that perhaps instead of seeing
our data as a plurality of different files addressed by name, we
should see it as one document, perhaps a very long one, divided into
sections, which can be addressed by content, simply by doing substring
searches.  (I’m not sure if his later work on The Humane Environment
continued to attempt this.)  Suffix arrays make it possible to scale
instant substring search up to at least hundreds of gigabytes of text,
if not more.</p>
<p>Aside from full-text indexing, sorting, and compression using
suffix-array-based schemes like the BWT, suffix arrays have also been
used for LZ77 and LZSS data compression, and compact infinite-order
Markov-chain models of text.</p>
<p>What else could you simplify in a computing system by using suffix
arrays?</p>
<h3>Levenshtein automata</h3>
<p>Levenshtein automata are finite-state machines that recognize strings
with up to a given Levenshtein distance from a desired search string;
in particular, you can simulate a Levenshtein automaton in parallel on
a sorted or trie index (including suffix-array indices) to find all
the fuzzy matches to a desired search string in a body of text.  The
automata grow in complexity as the maximum Levenshtein distance grows,
but for distances of 1, 2, and even 3, the nondeterministic
Levenshtein automaton has relatively reasonable size.</p>
<p>This is useful not only for words that someone might have misspelled,
but also ssdeep forensic hashes of malicious code, nucleotide or
peptide sequences,</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<h3>Formal methods</h3>
<p>“Formal methods” here means theorem-proving, specifically
machine-checked proofs of the correctness of programs.  Although this
line of research goes back to the 1960s, it has started producing
major results in the last few years, as people have finally started
getting it to scale to real-world programs, including the seL4 secure
kernel, the CompCert C compiler, a security kernel for an experimental
browser called Quark, and forthcoming work that reports having
verified the crash recovery of a filesystem.  Essentially all of this
has been done in a system called Coq so far, although other systems
like Isabelle/HOL are intended as possible alternatives.</p>
<p>Of course, proving your source code correct doesn’t help you much if
the compiler introduces bugs in the process of compiling, which is why
CompCert has been so central to this work.  But much of the machinery
of languages like C, and especially C++, is intended to do the same
kind of thing that things like Coq are good at — statically find bugs,
and automatically select possibly-correct behavior (such as applying a
floating-point multiplication operation to two floating-point numbers)
instead of clearly-incorrect behavior (such as applying an integer
multiplication operation to them).</p>
<p>A recent paper from Kennedy, Benton, Jensen, and Dagand, “<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nick/coqasm.pdf">Coq: The
World's Best Macro Assembler?</a>”, investigates the consequence — 
obvious in retrospect — that maybe we should just use write Coq code
to generate the assembly or machine code, along with a proof of
correctness.</p>
<p>This approach also offers the possible promise of being able to verify
properties that aren’t verifiable at C level, like a worst-case bound
on the number of bytes needed for the stack, or execution timing for a
timing loop; and it avoids the whole issue of proving the correctness
of an inherently complex program like a C compiler.</p>
<p>Myreen and Curello have also formally verified a bignum implementation
in AMD64 machine code using the HOL4 theorem prover.</p>
<p>Coq proof tactics are not Turing-complete — they are guaranteed to
terminate — but they are capable of proving substantially more
interesting safety properties of programs than the type systems of
languages like C, Java, and even OCaml.  (I suspect that C++’s
template system is Turing-complete, just very clumsy, in the same
league as languages like BF.)</p>
<p>This suggests a possible way to rehabilitate Forth, which is little
more than an assembly language with expressions, compile-time
metaprogramming, and reflection.  The problem with Forth, in my
limited experience and in hearsay, is that it’s too bug-prone, and so
you development starts to get slow pretty soon due to the bugs.  But
it invariably takes less total code to do anything in Forth than in
any other language, if you count the code implementing the primitives.
Perhaps a Forth could constitute a useful penultimate level of
intermediate representation, or even a better target language than
assembly, for such a program of formal verification at the
machine-code level.</p>
<p>Could you extend this macro-assembler approach into a full convenient
programming language embeded in Coq or a similar proof assistant?
What else could you simplify with a good proof assistant?</p>
<h3>Hash tables, expandable arrays, and sorting</h3>
<p>This, more than anything else, is the basis of languages like Python,
Perl, Lua, Tcl, JavaScript, and arguably the Unix shell: two generic
container types (or, in Lua’s case, just one) allow you to represent
things conveniently, and make the language easy to learn.  Typically
these use the Lisp object-graph memory model, in which all values and
storage location are a single machine word in size, usually populated
by a pointer.</p>
<p>Original Lisp in itself can be seen as the first such language: even
McCarthy’s 1959 paper had association lists in it, implemented
FORTRANishly using parallel lists of keys and values, rather than in
the now-standard alist representation of a list of pairs.  But Lisp
lists are optimized for structure-sharing ("persistence") and
recursion at the expense of rapid indexing, mutability, and
memory-efficiency, and Lisp’s traditional representation of finite
maps makes similar tradeoffs.  This disfavored imperative code.</p>
<p>So Perl’s 1987 minimal combination of arrays, associative arrays, and
a convenient imperative scripting language turned out to be an
extremely useful combination, particularly combined with regexps for
input processing and string interpolation for output.  Perl didn’t
have pointers before Perl 5, more or less obligating you to use
parallel arrays or parallel associative arrays, but it was still
eminently practical for a huge collection of tasks.</p>
<p>(REXX has “compound variables” which were associative arrays, which,
like Perl4 associative arrays, couldn’t be passed as arguments.  REXX
dates from 1979.  But it doesn’t have lists, and unlike Lua, there’s
no way to find out how many items are in a numerically-indexed
compound variable.)</p>
<p>This kind of decomposition works best if the underlying
implementations of the data structures are acceptably efficient across
a broad range of uses; Lisp lists’ O(N) append-item</p>
<p>Add sorting to arrays and associative arrays, as Perl did, and a whole
host of traditional algorithms become simple.  Parnas’s famous 1972
paper is about how a group of programmers could coordinate through
formal specifications to implement a KWIC index, essentially the
following Perl program, which he says “could be produced by a good
programmer within a week or two”.  It took me about 20 minutes,
although it wasn’t my first time.  It needs about ten or twenty times
as much RAM as the size of its input.</p>
<pre><code>while (&lt;&gt;) {
    @w = split;
    push @lines, "@w[$_+1..$#w] | @w[0..$_] $.\n" for (0..$#w-1);
}
print sort @lines;
</code></pre>
<p>(I think this program works in Perl 4, but I don’t have a copy handy
to test.)</p>
<p>I took another hour or so to write a much more efficient, if nearly as
obfuscated, version in Python, which can produce a KWIC index of the
Bible in a few minutes on my netbook:</p>
<pre><code>import sys

pos, aw, a = {}, [], []         # Each word is represented by index in aw
for r in sys.stdin:             # Build list of lists of word ids in a
    b = r.split()
    for w in b:
        if w not in pos:        # Assign an id to the new word
            pos[w] = len(aw)
            aw.append(w)
    a.append([pos[w] for w in b]) # Encode the line with word ids

g = sorted(range(len(aw)), key=aw.__getitem__) # Compute word sort permutation
v = [None] * len(aw)                           # Invert the permutation...
for i, j in enumerate(g): v[j] = i             # Now v[g[i]] == i.
a = [[v[w] for w in b] for b in a]             # Rewrite lines with permuted ids
cs = [(ln, wn) for ln, b in enumerate(a) for wn, _ in enumerate(b)]
cs.sort(lambda (lnx, wnx), (lny, wny): cmp(a[lnx][wnx:] + a[lnx][:wnx],
                                           a[lny][wny:] + a[lny][:wny]))
p = lambda ws: ' '.join(aw[g[w]] for w in ws) # map back to original words
sys.stdout.writelines("%5d: %s | %s\n" % (ln, p(a[ln][wn:]), p(a[ln][:wn]))
                      for ln, wn in cs)
</code></pre>
<p>(This task, of course, is trivial and perhaps even unnecessary if you
have a suffix array already computed (see above).  But it’s an
excellent example of how powerful primitives reduce the complexity of
previously complex tasks.)</p>
<p>Smalltalk, perhaps the original exponent of “powerful primitives for a
simplified computing system”, has OrderedCollection and Mapping (XXX?)
types, but culturally it doesn’t emphasize them; instead, it has a
wide variety of specialized collection types available, and it
emphasizes defining new application-specific means of aggregating and
finding things, perhaps wrapping an OrderedCollection or something.</p>
<p>Python has in some sense decayed a bit from this ideal: added to its
basic tuple, list, and dict generic containers, we now have sets,
generators, an entire <code>collections</code> module with containers like
defaultdict and deque, some of which are dangerously bug-prone.  While
it’s very useful to be able to define application-specific collection
types and use them via ad-hoc polymorphism, and often these
specialized collections are significantly faster in particular uses, I
worry this makes Python harder to learn than it used to be, and
perhaps also reduces the power available by combining
components — although at least these new collection types all support
common sequence and iterable protocols.</p>
<p>And of course bencode and JSON, and the systems based on them like
BitTorrent and MongoDB, are entirely based on these two container
types, plus primitive numbers, strings, and null.  Bencode goes an
additional step and ensures that the mapping between data structures
and serializations is one-to-one, like ASN.1 DER, allowing
cryptographic signatures and the use of content-hash-addressable
storage.</p>
<p>Could we simplify our systems and improve their composability by
designing them to handle more data in JSON-restricted forms?</p>
<h3>Finite binary relations</h3>
<p>One alternative that has occurred to me to the hash/array/sort
combination described in the previous item — or Lua/JS/REXX’s version
where you use a hash of int keys instead of an array, or PHP’s version
where the key-value pairs are ordered — is finite binary <em>relations</em>,
as opposed to the finite binary <em>maps</em> provided by hashes.  Relations
allow potentially more than one value for the same key; you can
implement them as, for example, hashes of sets.</p>
<p>I’ve written about a database query language based on binary relations
at <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/binary-relations">http://canonical.org/~kragen/binary-relations</a>, but I’m still not
sure if it’s a good idea.  But this is not about writing databases
with query optimizers and queries and whatnot; this is about using
binary relations as the standard container type in a very-high-level
programming language.</p>
<p>At the level of objects in a programming language, relations have some
possible advantages over maps.  Relations are closed under inverse,
composition, and transitive closure, as well as the set-theoretic
operations union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference,
which operate on the set of their key-value pairs; furthermore, the
inverse of the inverse of a relation is the original relation,
relational composition is associative, the set-theoretic operations
are commutative and associative, and there are various distributive
theorems you can prove.  You can try to define analogous operations on
maps, but I can’t think of definitions that support these properties.</p>
<p>If your relations are implemented with some kind of search tree over
the keys, rather than a hash table, then the keys can be efficiently
traversed in sorted order at any time, even when keys are being added
and deleted dynamically.  This obviates not only explicit sorting by
keys but also explicit heaps; a search tree has the same asymptotic
complexity for the usual heap operations.</p>
<p>Considering the KWIC program again, let’s see what it would look like
if Python had implicitly-ordered relations instead of dicts and
“lists”.</p>
<pre><code>import sys
</code></pre>
<p>Now we don’t need two separate collections for the words, but we still
do need to be able to rapidly map from a word to its id as we are
building up the word-id-sequence representation of the input text.  So
let’s store the words as the keys of a relation, their ids as the
values, and use a counter.  (Actually, maybe I should have done this
before.)</p>
<pre><code>n, aw, a = 0, {}, {}

for r in sys.stdin:
</code></pre>
<p>Do we want iteration in this Relational Python to be, in some sense,
iteration over a relation?  That is, do we want sys.stdin to somehow
present its lines as a relation, or do we keep the same iteration
protocol, which iterates over a sequence of things?  I think we should
keep the same protocol, because the nature of iteration isn’t
changing, just the containers.  Iteration is still the execution of a
block of code a sequence of times.</p>
<pre><code>    b = r.split()
</code></pre>
<p>Now what does split() return?  Presumably a relation, but where do the
words go — keys, values, or both?  And, if not both, what’s the other
side?  I think the answer is that, since the field sequence in <code>split</code>
is usually important, and we usually want to be able to do field
lookups by number, it should be a relation from field numbers to
words.  Here, we do care about the sequence of words eventually, since
we need to do cyclic shifts of them eventually.</p>
<p>But now we need to iterate over the words that don’t have ids, and we
don’t really care what order that happens in.  This sounds like set
subtraction, which we’ve already said is a fundamental operation on
relations, but the set we’re subtracting isn’t exactly <code>aw</code>, the
relation from words to their ids; it’s just <code>aw</code>’s keys.  But that’s
potentially a very large set, and we wouldn’t want to do anything
proportional to its size after every word.</p>
<p>So we’re declaring that getting the set of keys of a relation is a
constant-time operation, which seems plausible, since it doesn’t
require building a new key tree; it just requires interpreting the
traversal results slightly differently.  We’re also declaring that a
set is represented as a relation that stores the single value <code>True</code>
for each key.</p>
<pre><code>    for w in b.valueset - aw.keyset:
</code></pre>
<p>(Since the keyset and valueset operations are so fundamental, it might
be a good idea to provide syntactic sugar for them, like @b or aw@ or
something.)</p>
<p>We probably don’t want to have an <code>x[y] = z</code> operation for relations,
since <code>x[y]</code> is an unordered set of things, and the fundamental
operation is not replacing that set with a single item, but rather
adding an item to that set.  (Although, in this case, we’ve just
verified that that set is empty.)  So for now I’m going to use a
method, although some kind of syntactic sugar might be better.</p>
<pre><code>        aw.add(w, n)
        n += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Now we are faced with the need to translate the line (a mapping from
field indexes to strings) through the id table <code>aw</code> (a mapping from
strings to ids) before adding it to <code>a</code> (a mapping from line numbers
to sequences of word ids).  This is just relational composition, which
I will represent with the infix operator @:</p>
<pre><code>    a.append(aw @ b)
</code></pre>
<p>The order of the arguments to <code>@</code> is the traditional one for
relational or functional composition: the range values of <code>b</code> are the
domain values (keys) of <code>aw</code>, the range values of <code>aw</code> are the range
values of the result, and the domain values (keys) of <code>b</code> are the keys
of the result.  You could read this as "Values from <code>aw</code> at the keys
from <code>b</code>.  It's kind of like <code>aw[b]</code> except that <code>b</code> has a whole
sequence of indices for <code>aw</code> (in its values), not just one.</p>
<p>One potential problem here is that relational composition is
well-defined when the value on either side of the composition is
missing: <code>{4: 5, 6: 7} @ {1: 2, 3: 4}</code> is just <code>{3: 5}</code>, silently
ignoring the absence of any key 2 in the left relation and any value 6
in the rightmost relation, while the Python expression
<code>[pos[w] for w in b]</code> will instead raise an exception if <code>w</code> is not in
fact found in <code>pos</code>, which is probably a programming bug and the kind
of thing you would want it to catch.  We could define <code>@</code> to do that,
but I’m not sure we should.</p>
<p>This .append operation generates a new index by adding 1 to the
previous greatest index in the relation, which is a thing that can be
fetched in either constant time or logarithmic time.</p>
<p>Next, we need to permute the word ids according to the words, in order
to derive new word ids that will induce the correct lexicographical
ordering of cyclically-shifted lines.  But, since relations are
implicitly traversed in the order of their keys, this sorting is
achieved by simple relational inversion, after which we get the new
word ids by counting — using the <code>list()</code> function borrowed from
Python, which in Relational Python turns an iterable into a relation
with counting numbers as its keys:</p>
<pre><code>g = list(aw.inverse())
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we need to calculate the inverse mapping, from our original word
ids to our new word ids, and use it to rewrite our representation of
the text.</p>
<pre><code>v = g.inverse()
a = list(v @ b for b in a)
</code></pre>
<p>So far the program is slightly simpler than before.  Now, though, it
gets slightly more complicated, because the original code used a
comparator function instead of a key generation function to specify
the sort order of the cyclic shifts, specifically in order to avoid
the materialization of the entire universe of cyclic shifts in memory
at once.  Using a key function instead of the comparator makes it run
about three times faster on small datasets, but also use about 70%
more memory on my example dataset.  (My Python code uses about 12
bytes of RAM per input byte with the comparator optimization, and
about 30 bytes of RAM per input byte using the key function.)</p>
<p>However, it’s fairly simple to create a key class that lazily
generates the key it wants to be sorted by, if we declare that
relations use this <strong>key</strong> method to compare and sort their keys, but
don’t store their return values or leave an arbitrarily large number
of them out there hanging in space unfinished.</p>
<pre><code>class K(namedtuple('K', ['ln', 'wn'])): # line number, word number
    def __key__(self):
        return list(a[self.ln][self.wn:]) ++ a[self.ln][:self.wn]

cs = {K(ln, wn) for ln, b in a.items for wn in b.keys}
</code></pre>
<p>Here I’m declaring that ++ is the list concatenation operator, which
returns a new relation that is a superset of the first relation, with
the values from the second relation assigned to new indices as per
<code>.append</code>.  The list() call is needed because slicing a relation
returns you the key-value pairs from that slice unchanged.</p>
<p>The <code>{}</code> comprehension there is a set-comprehension, implicitly
mapping each key to <code>True</code>; if it had a <code>:</code> after <code>K(ln, wn)</code>, it
would be a relation comprehension.</p>
<p>There’s a problem here, though, which is that <code>a[self.ln]</code> is actually
an entire set of lines that happens to be, presumably, just one line.
I need to figure out how to handle that. XXX</p>
<p>The remainder of the code is simplified slightly from the Python
version, although it omits the <code>|</code>.  It’s assuming a <code>key()</code> top-level
function that invokes the <code>__key__</code> magic method.</p>
<pre><code>sys.stdout.writelines("%5d: %s\n" % (k.ln, ' '.join(aw @ g @ key(k)))
                      for k in cs.keys)
</code></pre>
<p>I’m not sure exactly what kind of thing the tuple there in the
string-formatting operation should be; is it a relation?  Should it
not exist?  Should I be writing it with <code>{}</code> or <code>[]</code>? XXX</p>
<h3>Transactions and transactional stores for concurrency</h3>
<p>Transactions are an architectural style for building systems, whether
distributed or otherwise, that contains the effects of each
computation inside a “transaction”, whose reads and writes are
monitored, and whose writes are not visible to other transactions
until it “commits”.  If it fails (according to arbitrary logic inside
the transaction), it doesn’t commit, and therefore has no effect.  The
system prevents transactions that had read data that was been written
before they committed, either by preventing it from being written
(perhaps by delaying or aborting the transactions that try to write
it) or by automatically aborting and retrying the transaction that
depended on the outdated data.  In this way, the transaction system
achieves an illusion of pure serial execution, while in fact
permitting great concurrency and even parallelism.</p>
<p>Ideally, in fact, the transaction should never be able to read any
data that were written after it started, in order to ensure that no
implicit consistency constraints among different data that it might
read are violated.  For example, a transaction calculating the average
packet size on a network interface might read the number of packets
transmitted and the number of bytes transmitted, then divide them.  If
this result is to be correct, the number of bytes it is dividing must
correspond to the number of packets it is dividing by.</p>
<p>(This is obviously easier to achieve if you have persistent data
structures, in the functional-programming sense.)</p>
<p>This kind of transaction is known as ACID: it's “atomic”, in that
either it has all of its effects or none of them; “consistent”, in
that only transactions whose internal failure logic does not abort
them will be committed; “isolated”, in the sense that concurrently
executing transactions can have no effect other than perhaps aborting
them; and, kind of unrelated to all of the above, “durable”, in the
sense that none of these properties are lost if your computer loses
power in the middle of the operation, and in particular no committed
transaction will be lost.</p>
<p>Practical transactional systems often relax some of these properties
to some extent.  For example, it’s very common for database systems
that can provide fully-ACID transactions to support lower “isolation
levels”, perhaps permitting a transaction to see an inconsistent state
of the database as it reads a sequence of different things.</p>
<p>The “Composable Memory Transactions” paper from 2005 or so proposes
using transactional <em>memory</em>, implemented in software, as a general
concurrency control mechanism for threads.  The CMT transactions
support nesting, and an outer transaction can react to the failure of
an inner transaction by trying an alternate code path; this permits a
more modular equivalent of the Unix select() call or the Win32
WaitForMultipleEvents, simply by trying such an alternation of nested
transactions that each fail when the event they await has not yet
happened.  If any one of them succeeds, then the overall transaction
continues; otherwise, it fails, and is later automatically retried
when any of the data it read before failing have been modified.  This
permits the automatic interconversion of blocking and non-blocking
APIs, something not possible by any traditional means other than
first-class continuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s an interesting correspondence between this kind of
transaction failure and failure in nondeterminism implemented by
backtracking.  When you hit a failure in a backtracking system, you
undo all the effects that led to that failure, back to the latest
backtracking point, and then try the next alternative from that
point.  This is exactly the same thing that happens in CMT when an
inner transaction fails: all of its effects are undone, and the
outer transaction can either fail in response, or try a different
alternative.  In both systems, only when the outermost transaction
succeeds do you get to see the set of assignments that it made.  One
interesting difference is that, in backtracking systems, the outer
transaction can fail the inner transaction after it has already
“committed”, possibly causing it to succeed with a different set of
effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of transactional-memory discipline probably isn’t reasonably
efficient and effective without either hardware transactional memory
support, or a sufficiently smart compiler or prover, to ensure that no
effects escape a transaction before it is committed.</p>
<p>Obviously you can implement this kind of transactional-memory
interface with a networked server instead of stuff in the same process
as the transactions; although you can’t prove that the stuff on the
other end of the socket is respecting the requirement to have no
effect if it gets aborted, having it in a separate process makes other
kinds of isolation more plausible to implement, and the possible high
concurrency may be more valuable when you can spread it across a whole
network.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a clear connection to automatic dependency tracking and
deterministic rebuilding, as well as to reactive programming: the read
and write tracking the transactional memory does is the same read and
write tracking a reactive programming system like Meteor does, and
indeed the re-execute-when-an-input-changes logic used by the CTM
paper for transactions that haven’t committed is the same thing Meteor
does for “computations” that are still live.  You could even imagine a
nondeterministic search algorithm like a truth maintenance system
implemented in these terms: if transaction A makes a write that
results in a failure in a later transaction B, then transaction A is
rolled back retroactively, along with all the things resulting from
it, and re-executed with that write rigged to blow up — at which point
A can either fail, or handle the error by trying a different write.</p>
<p>All of this could be implemented at a number of different levels.  One
interesting level, for interacting with current systems, would be
running a shell script inside an isolated environment monitored by a
transaction system; it can read files and directories, write files,
and spawn subtransactions, and if it completes successfully, then its
writes are committed and become visible to other scripts.  By itself,
this would suffice to simplify certain kinds of system management
tasks: you could abort long-running scripts halfway through without
fear that they would leave things in an inconsistent state, and the
transactional discipline would ensure that concurrent execution didn’t
cause subtle bugs.  (And no more tempfile race holes!)  But the
prospect that you could, later on, automatically re-execute the script
if any of its inputs changed, perhaps with a frequency limit or extra
wait time, and perhaps automatically deleting its previous outputs in
the interim — that seems like it could simplify a lot of things.</p>
<p>All of this shell-script stuff seems like it would work best with a
blob store, in order to make it practical to distribute this work
across machines, and also so that the operation of “committing” and
making visible the output files can be done quickly.</p>
<p>We normally think of ACID transactions as being incompatible with
eventually-consistent and partition-tolerant databases, because of
Brewer’s CAP conjecture (later somebody’s XXX theorem), which is that
you can’t be consistent (in the sense of serialization), available (in
the sense of always handling all requests), and partition-tolerant
(maintaining these in the face of network partitions).  But the above
suggests a way to achieve at least ACI transactions in an eventually-
consistent partition-tolerant system: if you remember the entire
transition history and dependency graph, then you can commit a
transaction and, when you find that it was in conflict, later roll it
back, along with everything that transitively depended on it, then
re-execute them in a proper order.  This sounds pretty wild, but it is
more or less the way that the US credit card and banking system work:
any transaction can be disputed and rolled back for a month or three,
which may result in rolling back other dependent transactions.  It
kind of means that your system can never make any promises to the
outside world, though, which is becoming a friction point for
interactions between US financial institutions and things like Bitcoin
and physical goods delivery, which do not support rollback.</p>
<p>Re-executing the whole dependent sub-DAG of transactions at the
timestamp when you discovered the conflict should be safe, at least if
only one node is doing it.  Re-executing them at their original
timestamps with the new data could result not only in them writing
different contents to the same locations, which is harmless since that
only affects other transactions in the dependent sub-DAG that you were
going to re-execute anyway, but also writing things to locations they
didn’t write to before.  This could result in the need to re-execute
other transactions that weren’t originally part of the dependent
sub-DAG.  I don’t know what the best choice is here.  (However, I’m
deeply struck by the correspondence with Umut Acar’s self-adjusting
computation algorithms, in which function calls are required to pass
values around only by reading and writing memory, to read values from
memory only at the beginning of a function, and you re-execute
function calls if their inputs changed — and each function invocation
is timestamped with a virtual clock in order, if I understand
correctly, to allow safely memoizing functions that access memory.)</p>
<p>This whole re-executing thing requires that the code that was executed
in the transaction be preserved so that it can be re-executed later if
the transaction needs to be rolled back and redone due to a conflict.
In a distributed database context, you probably want to reference that
code with a hash stored in a content-hash-addressable storage system
rather than by saving a copy of your entire source base in every
replicated transaction record.</p>
<p>(Also note that if you’re saving and replicating the entire past
history of transaction inputs, timestamps, and code, plus an initial
database state, you have in effect turned your database into a CRDT;
you replicate this history, perhaps using gossip (see below), and can
then deterministically replay all the transactions to
deterministically rebuild the current state of the database, and any
node doing this will get the same results.  This may be simpler to do
if you in fact execute the transactions serially, eliminating the need
to track inputs and outputs at fine granularity, though the more usual
transaction approaches may give you better performance.)</p>
<p>This may be a foundation that simplifies operational-transform-based
collaborative editing systems like Etherpad and Gobby.</p>
<h3>Automatic differentiation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatic differentiation ... computes ... any derivative or
gradient, of any function you can program, or of any program that
computes a function, with machine accuracy and ideal asymptotic
efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s an abstract-execution technique that executes programs on data
that is annotated with its partial derivatives with regard to input
data values, which is to say, the numerical Jacobian matrix of the
program (and the Hessian, ad infinitum), evaluated at a point.
<a href="http://alexey.radul.name/ideas/2013/introduction-to-automatic-differentiation/">Alexey Radul wrote a comprehensive introduction</a>.  It’s easy to
implement; Conal Elliott <a href="http://conal.net/papers/beautiful-differentiation/beautiful-differentiation.pdf">wrote a 2009 paper on this, where the first
example shows how to do it for first derivatives of scalar functions
only in 30 lines of Haskell.</a></p>
<p>The idea is that when you call a function and it produces some data
structure full of values, you get not only the values, but also a lazy
list of which inputs each of those values (locally) depends on, and
what the coefficient of variation is between them at that point, and
similarly for what that variation depends on, with minimal overhead.</p>
<p>This could be particularly useful with AI optimization algorithms that
are trying to find input values for a piece of code that will produce
a given output value, such as zero, or a given image.  Gradient
descent needs to know the gradient, after all.  The alternative is
hill-climbing by groping around in various directions looking for a
local improvement, like a caterpillar at the end of a twig, which can
be very slow in a high-dimensional space.</p>
<p>A lot of these are only feasible with what’s called “reverse-mode”
automatic differentiation.</p>
<p>There’s clearly also a relationship here with incremental computation,
which exactly computes the new value of a function after an
incremental change to the input by tracking which parts of the
computation depend on that input; truth-maintenance-system constraint
solvers, which trace back constraint violations they find to the
minimal combination of nondeterministic guesses they made that will
cause that constraint violation, in order to avoid wasting time with
that in the future; probabilistic programming, which in some sense
traces back observations of outputs to probability distributions over
nondeterministic variables that would be needed to produce those
outputs; neural networks (see below), whose “training” works by
adjusting edge weights to reduce the difference between the output and
the desired output, and indeed AD applied to neural-network evaluator
does produce the backpropagation outputs; and interval arithmetic,
which can produce conservative approximations that are much less
conservative if it knows which uncertain input variables or
intermediate computations an uncertainty bound depends on (consider
b · b · b · b vs. b⁴).</p>
<p>In particular, both incremental computation and automatic
differentiation have to deal with the problem of preserving
overwritten state when applied to imperative programs that use
mutation internally; the body of knowledge that has developed around
automatic differentiation is likely to be useful for implementing
incremental computation.</p>
<p>Automatic differentiation only determines the derivatives in the local
neighborhood of the computation that was actually carried out, and so
in particular conditionals are not reflected; automatic
differentiation will compute that <code>x ? -y-z : w/2</code> has a nonzero
derivative relative to either <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> or to <code>w</code>, but not relative
to all three, and not relative to <code>x</code>.  For this reason, I expect it
to be complementary to logical/symbolic search and deduction systems
like miniKanren or SAT solvers or other constraint solvers, thus
saving those systems from having to consider individual bits of a
numeric result.  (An SMT solver, if I understand correctly, is just a
SAT solver extended with such an external “theory checker”.)</p>
<p>(Similarly, the original truth maintenance system in Stallman and
Sussman 1977 was a nonlinear circuit simulation package, kind of like
an early SPICE; it was used to search among combinations of cases for
piecewise-linear circuit component models, each case considered then
being solved by a linear constraint solver.)</p>
<p>In the mathematically-oriented programming language Julia, <a href="http://www.juliadiff.org/">there are
several automatic differentiation libraries</a>, and one named
ReverseDiffSource is used by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo engine Lora
to compute gradients of statistical models for, as far as I can tell,
probabilistic programming systems (see above).</p>
<p>Interestingly, it turns out that <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/tropics/ad/whatisad.html">the Tapenade automatic
differentiation system</a> uses program-state snapshotting (see
above) and deterministic rebuilding (see above) to allow its
reverse-mode automatic differentiation to work on imperative programs
that overwrite part of their state during execution.</p>
<p>“The <a href="http://www.autodiff.org/?module=Introduction&amp;submenu=FAQ#6">largest application to date</a> [to have been automatically
differentiated] is a 1.6 million line FEM code written in Fortran 77.”</p>
<p>How widely can automatic differentiation be applied?  Does it indeed
synergize with efficient constraint solvers like miniKanren or CVC4,
as I speculate above?</p>
<p>(I don’t really understand automatic differentiation, so I hope none
of the above contains any grievous errors.)</p>
<h3>Bitcoin</h3>
<p>Some years ago, after a conversation with Aaron Swartz, Zooko wrote a
paper with an unmemorable title, now generally known as the “Zooko’s
Triangle paper”.  He proposed that although we would like
globally-unique names in computer systems to be human-readable,
securely dereference to the correct referent, and not be vulnerable to
a centralized authority, in practice we can only achieve any two of
these three properties.</p>
<p>Specifically, secure hashes, as used in content-hash-addressable blob
stores, are not human-readable (the best we’ve been able to do is
reduce them to about 80 bits and use representations like “able merit
floor gower jerry jews sd”, “ADD RAKE BABY LUCK MADE GOLD FEET SEEN”,
or “企琖鑣毐昕传”), and other kinds of global names are not
"self-certifying", in Mazières’s sense, so it would seems that we have
to trust some external authority to certify them.  Of course, fully
homomorphic encryption (see above) could in theory enable this problem
to be solved, but it's still not feasible, and when Zooko wrote his
paper, it wasn’t even on the radar.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, a variation on Nick Szabo’s property title clubs, came out
some years later.  As Aaron pointed out, it demonstrated an
alternative: a replicated global data store subject to nearly
arbitrary consistency constraints that was not vulnerable to any
particular participant, without having to figure out how to do FHE.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and pseudonymous cryptocurrency systems like it may be the
most powerful primitive in this list, to the point that I suspect they
may be a bad idea — the reason I haven’t participated so far.
Frictionless cross-border capital flows like those enabled by Bitcoin
were expected to result from Chaum’s centralized anonymous "digital
cash" systems, which instead failed in the market.  As Intel physicist
Timothy C. May famously observed at the Hackers conference (perhaps
Hackers 1989?), such flows seem likely to make taxation essentially
voluntary, resulting in the collapse of governments.  As pointed out
later on the cypherpunks list, they could also enable pseudonymous
betting to be used to crowdfund political assassinations, something
that John Poindexter tried in 2003 in the Total Information Awareness
program, resulting in a Congressional inquiry; this also seems likely
to result in the collapse of governments.</p>
<p>I expect this to be a traumatic event, possibly resulting in the
destruction of civilization.</p>
<p>However, Bitcoin also can be applied to solve a variety of difficult
distributed-systems problems, and civilization might survive it and
therefore be able to apply it to them.  Naming is one; remitting money
to your family overseas is another; email postage to stop spam is
another; secure P2P rendezvous advertisement is another; </p>

<h3>Deep neural networks</h3>
<h3>Conservative approximation</h3>
<p>of what?  parsing, say, or interval arithmetic.</p>
<h3>Closures and Continuations</h3>
<p>This is the Scheme 1975 vision of powerful primitives: closures give
you one single way to do ad-hoc polymorphism, by giving you in a sense
first-class templated functions which you can press into service both
as objects, as lazily evaluated values, and as basic blocks for
control-flow constructs; and call-with-current-continuation gives you
one single control-flow construct that subsumes threads, exceptions,
Common-Lisp-style resumable errors, and backtracking, and allows you
to invert control flow and turn blocking functions into nonblocking
ones, and vice versa, which is kind of like the transactional memory
concurrency constructs I mentioned above.  Raph Levien’s Io language
provides a clean syntax that uses closure invocation even for
statement sequencing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a sense these constructs are <em>too</em> powerful.</p>
<p>If a continuation can be saved from anywhere, it’s unsafe to
irreversibly clean up resources on exit from the block where they are
used; a continuation invocation could transfer control back inside,
for example to implement thread context switching.  At last I think
<code>dynamic-wind</code> has been added to the Scheme standard, but it is
substantially harder to use than <code>unwind-protect</code> or <code>try/finally</code>.
Unrestricted multi-use first-class continuations can be implemented
simply by allocating all your activation records on the heap, but
implementing them <em>efficiently</em> more or less requires implementing
segmented stacks, which makes every function call more expensive,
although stack segmentation also makes threads a heck of a lot
cheaper.</p>
<p>And even very clever compilers are unlikely to match the <a href="http://mortoray.com/2013/09/12/the-true-cost-of-zero-cost-exceptions/">zero-cost
exception handling</a> that’s standard in modern C++.</p>
<p>In a sense, using one single construct for all of these things
requires both the human reader and either the compiler or the runtime
to reconstruct a conservative approximation of some knowledge that was
in the head of the original author (is this a thrown exception, a
backtrack, or a thread context switch?), but who didn’t write it down.</p>
<p>The same problem attends the use of closures and tail-calls for all
control flow.  The set of variables captured by a closure is purely
implicit, so both the human reader and the compiler must reconstruct
them; consequently, the lifetime of variables in a language with
closures is purely implicit.  But the compiler needs this lifetime
information to produce efficient code, the author needs it to write
code that works, and a human reader needs it to understand the code.</p>
<p>So I feel that, while continuations and closures are extremely
powerful <em>semantic</em> primitives, and they have brilliantly elucidated
many crucial aspects of compilation, their strength-to-weight ratio as
<em>system-building</em> primitives is in doubt.  They do result in shorter
source code, but they often don’t succeed in decoupling the code built
on top of them from the aspects of the implementation they elide.</p>
<p>You could make many of the same accusations about dynamic typing, of
course.  I think the major difference is that while dynamic typing
makes debugging easier (because the program mostly runs, and then when
it crashes with a type error, you see an example of why), closures and
first-class continuations make debugging harder.</p>
<p>You could make a similar accusation about implicit imperative
control-flow sequencing: your program implicitly specifies a total
ordering of computational steps to perform, and then the compiler
works hard to recover the partial order you actually had in mind, in
order to be able to execute your code efficiently.  Nowadays, so does
your out-of-order-executing CPU.</p>
<h3>Collaboration facilities</h3>
<h3>Succinct data structures</h3>
<p>“Succinct data structures” are an extension of the compressed indexing
work I mentioned under “suffix arrays”.  Unfortunately, I don’t
understand them.  XXX</p>
<h3>Interval arithmetic</h3>
<p>Interval arithmetic is a particular form of conservative approximation
(through abstract interpretation), with two principal uses: preventing
numerical errors and avoiding computation.</p>
<p>Numerical errors are ubiquitous where we use floating-point math,
because floating-point has finite precision, so its results are
commonly approximate.  The IEEE-754 floating-point standard offers
control of the rounding mode — you can request that calculation
results be rounded, for example, up or down.  This allows you to, for
example, calculate the sum of a list of numbers twice, once rounding
up and once rounding down, and be sure that the true result was
bounded by the two calculated results.</p>
<p>In interval arithmetic, instead of calculating with individual
numbers, we calculate with (min, max) pairs of numbers known to bound
the true quantity.  Calculating (a, b) + (c, d) is quite simple: it’s
just (a + c (rounded down), b + d (rounded up)).  Some other
operations, like multiplication, are more complicated: (a, b) × (c, d)
might be (a × c, b × d), but, for example, if a and b are positive and
c and d are negative, it will be (b × c, a × d), with the appropriate
rounding.  Division is a bit more complicated still: (a, b) ÷ (c, d)
might be a neighborhood of infinity, if c and d have opposite signs.</p>
<p>Interval-arithmetic libraries are available for bulletproofing your
numerical computations by, as above, doing each operation two or more
times, using different rounding modes.  This can save you a lot of
numerical analysis.  These libraries are powerful and well-developed,
but they are not really what interests me at the moment.</p>
<p>The more interesting case, to me, is avoiding computation.</p>
<p>SICP gives the example of approximating the zero of an arbitrary
continuous, not necessarily differentiable, function, by recursively
subdividing an interval in which it is seen to cross zero.  You can
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/aspmisc/intervalgraph">extend this to find the zero locus of an arbitrary continuous
multidimensional function</a> by using interval arithmetic to rule out
intervals where the function cannot be zero.  But the technique has
fairly broad applicability.</p>
<p>Consider backface removal.  In rendering a solid bounded by polygons
viewed from the outside, you can avoid half the occlusion computation
if you eliminate the polygons that face away from the camera, since
they will always be occluded by polygons on the near side of the
object.  So you can compute the normal for each polygon and consider
whether it’s facing toward or away from the camera.</p>
<p>This still involves computing something for each polygon on each
frame, though.  Interval arithmetic can save us.  Suppose that the
surface mesh is recursively divided into regions, and we store
intervals for the x, y, and z components of the normals of the
polygons in each region.  Now, we can traverse this tree recursively
and not even descend into parts of the surface all of whose polygons
face away from the camera, or for that matter all of whose polygons
face toward the camera.  It’s only the mixed regions that require
examination.</p>
<p>This saves us nearly all the computation for the backfaces, but we are
still traversing the tree on each frame.  We can do better still.
Suppose we are rotating the object at a fixed, slow speed.  Then, the
rotation matrix for a given span of time can <em>also</em> be represented
with interval coefficients, and we can multiply the normal intervals
for mesh regions through this rotation matrix, discovering which parts
of the surface don’t face the camera at all during entire time
intervals.</p>
<p>Somewhat similarly, when you’re rendering, if you can compute the
color at a point on the screen, and then bounds on the <em>gradient</em> of
the color in pixel coordinates for a region around that point, you can
determine whether that area contains any detail that needs to be
rendered.  If it’s just a smooth gradient (the d[color]/dx and
d[color]/dy are tightly bounded), you can render just a smooth
gradient.  And if you’re computing an animation, you can also compute
bounds over time.</p>
<p>(This is in some sense related to memoization and incremental
computation: it allows you to change an input to a function slightly
and retain its previous value, as long as you don’t move outside an
interval for which you’ve computed the result.)</p>
<p>I’m trying to remember the name of the guy who did his dissertation on
precise interval-arithmetic rendering of implicit surfaces.</p>
<p>This is a kind of wild generalization of the widely-known bounding-box
culling technique in computer graphics, and it allows us to achieve
enormous economies of computation by computing that entire regions of
a space of possibilities are of no interest.  It’s common to get
three, four, or five orders of magnitude speedup with this approach,
which you can then apply to focusing in more detail on the areas where
more detail is called for.</p>
<p>It seems clear that this kind of possibility-bounding can work
hand-in-hand with AI search algorithms (or simple nondeterministic
search) and optimization algorithms, although I’ve never seen it
applied in that way.  If your SMT solver is looking for a
contradiction in a region, you may be able to rule out the entire
region at once.  If you can place bounds on the “goodness” of points
in an entire region of the parameter space, you may be able to quickly
focus in on parts of the parameter space that are possibly of
interest.</p>
<p>This only works usefully for operations that are in some useful sense
mostly continuous, where reducing the size of the domain you’re
considering for an input will provoke a usefully reduced size of the
range over which the operation’s outputs are to be found.  The
bit-reversal function, for example, will tend to wreak havoc on
interval-arithmetic approaches; you can only put useful (min, max)
bounds on its output once its input is inside a very small range
indeed.  An interesting question is whether you can extend the kind of
tractability that interval arithmetic provides to other kinds of
functions, perhaps by using different representations than simply
(min, max) pairs.</p>
<p>For example, earlier today I was optimizing a proportional-font
word-wrap algorithm, which is one of the more expensive parts of a
text-rendering system, simply because it has to examine every
character of the text it’s wrapping to discover its glyph width.  You
could imagine a precomputed general-purpose interval tree covering the
text, consisting of statements like “characters from 1032 to 1040 are
all in the alphabetical interval ‘a’ to ‘l’”.  From such an interval
and a similar tree built over the font metrics, you could calculate a
glyph-width interval: all the characters in that range then have a
glyph width between 2 and 4, perhaps.  And that would allow you to
bound the sum of those glyph widths to be in the range (8×2, 8×4),
which means that it’s much less than the line width.</p>
<p>You could imagine a word-wrap algorithm expressed in a higher-level
form, seeking the last candidate linebreak character before the prefix
sum of the glyph widths of the characters exceeded the column width,
being executed efficiently by progressively approximating the
width-exceeding crossover and the last candidate linebreak, avoiding
examining most of the characters.</p>
<p>But it seems obvious that such an algorithm, if it were useful (most
likely it would only be faster than visiting every character once the
lines became unreasonably long) would work <em>much better</em> if the
interval tree over the text bounded the text’s <em>glyph widths</em>, not its
<em>codepoint values</em>, because the mapping from codepoint to glyph width
is so irregular.  As soon as your interval includes both ‘l’ and ‘m’,
it spans the full range of possible glyph widths — even if the text
itself is “the”!</p>
<h3>Lempel-Ziv compression: an update</h3>
<h3>Gossip</h3>
<p>IPv4 provides you with a universal address space and a low-latency
unreliable datagram sending facility.  Put the seven bytes of a
destination IP address, protocol number, and port number into the head
of an IP datagram, calculate the checksum, and hand it to your nearest
router, and it’ll likely get delivered to its destination.  This is a
seriously powerful primitive, enabling you to knit together all kinds
of disparate unreliable transport networks into a single giant
network: the inter-net.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only application that this directly provides is
voice-over-IP, or maybe unreliable instant messaging.  TCP is a little
higher-level in some sense: it gives you a virtual serial-port
connection or bidirectional pipe.  This is still very low-level for
many applications.</p>
<p>A gossip protocol is a way to share data among a group of participants
despite unreliable and intermittent connectivity among them; whenever
two succeed in rendezvousing, they interchange information.  Typically
gossip is used to converge on a gradually-growing set, but you can
substitute any CRDT (see above) for the graduallly-growing set.</p>
<p>Gossip is no higher-level than TCP, and indeed many routing protocols
are gossip-based.  You can run it on top of other protocols, of
course, and Bitcoin (see above) distributes both transactions and
mined blocks using gossip.</p>
<p>Generally gossip protocols are resilient against information loss, but
not against information flooding, and flooding can be the effective
equivalent of loss.  This typically means that either you must be able
to identify and disconnect flooders, for example in a gossip-net
including only your laptop, your phone, and your server; or you must
be able to drop messages when a flood is in progress, resulting in
information loss.  Bitcoin ameliorates this problem using hashcash
(the proof of work being the hash of the newly mined block) but this
approach doesn’t ensure that legitimate messages will be propagated;
it can raise the price of propagating them too high.</p>
<h3>Algebraic incremental updates</h3>
<p>Several of the earlier items in this document talk about incrementally
updating the result of a computation by means of memoizing small
pieces of it and only re-executing the parts affected by an input
change.  However, in some cases, a more efficient approach is
available; Manuel Simoni wrote about it a few years back in the case
of incremental MapReduce.</p>
<p>Doing a MapReduce incrementally with the memoizing approach is
possible, of course.</p>
<p>The map function runs on an input chunk and produces a sorted
mapped-input chunk in the filesystem; this file is in a sense a
memoized result of the map function, or rather a whole pile of
memoized results, and a small change to the input file generally
should produce a small change to this output file, and it can do so
efficiently if you can figure out what part of the output file
corresponds to unchanged input.</p>
<p>The reduce function is a bit trickier, since it’s running on an
arbitrarily large set of mapped-input chunks with the same key.  We
can take some advantage of the fact that those chunks are in an
arbitrary order, so the reduction is more or less required to be
associative and commutative, so we can apply the reduction operator in
a tree topology, which is an optimal configuration for memoization to
be able to minimize the work for an input change, to O(log N).</p>
<p>However, in many cases, the reduce function is not merely commutative
and associative; it also admits an inverse.  (Min, max, and other
quantile functions are the usual exceptions.)  In these cases, a much
more efficient approach is available, which processes input changes in
O(1): when a mapped-input record goes away, you update the reduction
function’s output with its inverse; when a new mapped-input record is
added (“inserted” into reduce’s input), you simply update the
reduction function’s output with it; and mutations can be handled as a
removal composed with an insertion.</p>
<p>This is also the way that relational databases normally handle index
updates.  They do not recompute the index for a table when a value in
an indexed column changes, not even reusing memoized mergeable index
blocks built from unchanged blocks of records; they delete the old
value from the index and insert the new one.  In this case, the
“reduction” operation could be considered the updating of a sorted
master file with a sorted update file containing insertions and
deletions, and sometimes it is actually implemented this way,
accumulating updates in a “side file” until they are large enough to
be efficiently applied.</p>
<p>I’m calling this approach to incremental updates “algebraic” because
it depends on algebraic properties of the reduction function: that it
is commutative, associative, and admits an inverse, making it an
Abelian group operation, I think. XXX</p>
<p>The old trick of compositing on-screen objects using XOR is another
example of this: to move a sprite, you would first quickly XOR it with
the pixels at its old position, and then at its new position, rather
than calculating a bounding box for the update that needed to be
slowly redrawn from some kind of scenegraph.  METAFONT’s
representation of filledness (each pixel contains a count of how many
times it’s been painted; 0 is white, anything else is black) would
also be amenable to such an approach to animation, perhaps without the
overlap artifacts that attended the XOR approach.</p>
<p>Are there other cases where such an algebraic property of a reduction
or combination function could be exploited to get rapid incremental
updates of cached computation results?  Is there an automatic way to
discover them, perhaps through abstract interpretation, thus avoiding
the need to explicitly program the algebraic incremental update in
each case?</p>
<h3>Compile-time instrumentation and object-code instrumentation</h3>
<p>A lot of the techniques discussed here involve augmenting some kind of
program with extra new functionality: maybe running it forwards and
backwards, or changing its regular number arithmetic into arithmetic
on intervals or Jacobians.  In an interpreted object-oriented
language, that’s fairly easy: instead of passing in a Number object,
you pass in an Interval object or whatever.  But what if you’re
dealing with code that isn’t interpreted, maybe because you want it to
run fast?</p>
<p>You can abstractly interpret machine code, of course, amounting to a
sort of augmented emulator.  Valgrind and AFL show two approaches to
this problem: AFL inserts extra tracking code into the program at
compile-time, and Valgrind inserts it into the program’s machine code.
A framework for this kind of instrumentation allows you to perform
such analyses on arbitrary programs, without having to build the
programs around the particular kind of abstract execution that you
want.</p>
<p>I am not yet sure how useful this is, but I suspect that the answer is
“very useful indeed”.  With this kind of technique, you can in theory
build programs or subroutines with any existing toolchain that
produces machine code, then treat them as any of a variety of abstract
models.</p>
<p>This might seem like a very difficult thing to do, and indeed Valgrind
is a monument to great software engineering, but I think you can
probably get a significant fraction of the way there with relatively
little effort.  The /bin/ls installed on this netbook is about
nineteen thousand instructions; half of those are mov, movl, or jmp,
and getting to 18000 involves also call, lea, je, cmp, test, add, nop,
jne, pop, sub, push, xor, ret, cmpb, movzbl, movb, sete, and or.  If
you handled common instructions like those and the other control-flow
instructions, and you were running on a 386-family CPU, you could
probably have a slow general-purpose path for the instructions you
didn’t write special handling for, simply by snapshotting the
registers, jumping to a piece of code that has the instruction, and
then snapshotting the registers again to see what changed.</p>
<p>This is a fair bit of code, but a lot less than a decent C compiler.</p>
<h3>Partial evaluation</h3>
<p>A lot of software optimization techniques have to do with specializing
a generic algorithm for a particular set of circumstances.  A
polymorphic multiplication is slow; a 32-bit by 32-bit integer
multiply is faster; a 32-bit integer multiply by the number 10 is
potentially faster still.  Automatically deriving these simpler
versions, given the general case and an argument to hold constant, is
“partial evaluation” or sometimes “specialization”.  A lot of the C++
STL could be thought of as partial evaluation of ad-hoc polymorphic
operations: you take, say, a generic sorting algorithm and you
specialize it for a particular container type, which itself is a
generic container type specialized for a particular element type.  In
a language like Smalltalk, all of these algorithms and containers
might be equally polymorphic, but with the type decisions made at
run-time rather than compile-time.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of this class of optimizations is that they are
often applicable at the source-language level, rather than requiring a
separate lower-level language to express them in, as register
allocation often does.</p>
<p>The three Futamura projections are a particularly recursive
application of this concept.</p>
<p>In the first Futamura projection, an interpreter specialized for a
particular input program becomes an executable version of that
program, an approach which may be useful even in its crudest form if
your objective is merely simplifying installation; but given the
mythical Sufficiently Intelligent Optimizer, is a rigorous way to
automatically derive an executable from a source program and an
interpreter.</p>
<p>Of course, automatically deriving an executable from a source program
is compiling it.  So if you partially evaluate the partial evaluator
(!) with respect to the interpreter argument, you have generated a
compiler from the interpreter, again automatically.  This is the
second Futamura projection.</p>
<p>Thus, if you partially evaluate the partial evaluator, whose two
arguments are a program and an input to hold constant, with respect to
its program argument, you have generated a compiler-compiler, which
will convert an interpreter for any language into a compiler for that
same language.</p>
<p>In a sense, this is cheating a little bit: your “compiler” can only
run on the same platform the interpreter ran on (and which the partial
evaluator was equipped to understand and optimize code for), so this
doesn’t work for cross-compilers, and somebody had to write the
executable code to perform each of the operations in the interpreted
language — either using another compiler, or in machine code, or the
code for whatever platform the interpreter was written for.  Typically
people write partial evaluators for “nice” platforms like Scheme or C
instead of hairy platforms like AMD64 or Forth, so this doesn’t really
help you with compiler bootstrapping, by itself.</p>
<p>It could help enormously with compiler optimizations, though, and
compiler optimizations expand the scope of high-level constructs that
you can write without an unacceptable loss of performance.</p>
<p>Implementing partial evaluation in a useful way involves program
slicing — tracing the flow of values through the program from the
fixed argument — and also abstract interpretation, since often the
useful statements that we can deduce about intermediate results in the
program are not their exact values but merely particular predicates
that are true of them at particular points in the program.</p>
<p>From another point of view, mechanical partial evaluation allows us to
move computation freely between compile-time and run-time, letting us
metaprogram in exactly the same language our run-time program is
written in, and indeed mixing code at the two times freely.  (Under
some circumstances such an intimate commingling might be undesirable —
for example, if you want to be able to predict the run time or memory
usage of the output program.  But perhaps you could make queries or
assertions about the compiler output to fill this gap.)</p>
<p>A very similar kind of partial-evaluation-at-run-time is what’s behind
Acar’s algorithms for self-adjusting computation: you have a hoard of
precomputed results flowing from the input arguments that didn’t
change, and you need only compute the results that flow from the
arguments that did.  This suggests that cross-fertilization between
the approaches may be fruitful: any techniques that can accelerate or
simplify one of them are likely to be applicable to the other.
Self-adjusting computation is in some sense more powerful, in that its
hoard of memoized results allows an efficient response to a change in
<em>any subset</em> of the inputs, rather than just <em>one particular subset</em>;
but partial-evaluation systems can use specialized machine operations
for the interactions between the fixed and variable subsets of values.</p>
<p>In particular, you may be able to generate a partially evaluated
program by taking an execution trace of a self-adjusting program with
respect to a particular set of changed input values.  You may have to
use either abstract execution (changing the input values to "unknown
1", "unknown 2", etc.) or systematically explore the space of possible
sequences of taken branches (like American Fuzzy Lop, perhaps, or
perhaps using a more systematic approach of backtracking to before
each branch and taking it the other direction, with some kind of
conservative trace merging in order to keep trace proliferation
finite.  You can either reason backwards from a branch condition to
find inputs that will lead to it, or you can conservatively assume
that if conditional X was computed transitively from input Y, then
it’s possible for input Y to make it go either way, and force it to go
the wrong way, thus generating a conservative approximation of the
possible Y-driven control flows.)</p>
<p>How wide a spectrum of optimizations can partial evaluation take over?
What kind of language would be best suited for use with it?</p>
<h3>Linear algebra</h3>
<p>Matrix multiplication, that kind of thing.  Maybe this is too obvious
to mention, since it’s fundamental to 3-D rendering, to statistical
computing, to scientific computing in general, and so on.  Still, it’s
not applied to as many things as it could be, in part because it’s
often considered purely numerical in nature.</p>
<p>As one example, the table of defined symbols in an executable or
library could be thought of as a vector along a dimension of symbols,
with the signal’s definition (usually a memory address) at each point.
The table of <em>undefined</em> symbols (unresolved relocations) in an object
file (including an executable or library) is a (sparse) matrix whose
rows are symbols and whose columns are memory addresses that refer to
those symbols.  Multiplying the symbol table through the relocations
matrix gives you a (sparse) vector of values to be added to the object
file.  In this way, a general-purpose parallel, distributed, or
incremental sparse-matrix-multiplication algorithm provides you with a
parallel, distributed, or incremental linker.</p>
<p>(In practice, you might have different relocation types, and on the
386, the addresses might not be aligned, but you nevertheless need to
compute carries, so it’s not quite as simple as regarding the object
file as a large dense vector of words some of which contain memory
addresses.)</p>
<h3>Convolution</h3>
<p>Convolution is a well-established powerful primitive for digital
signal processing and the mathematics of linear time-invariant
systems, in particular because of two very useful properties for
improving computational efficiency:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Closure under composition</strong>.  Any linear time-invariant transform
   of a signal can be represented by convolution with some kernel, and
   convolution with any kernel is a linear time-invariant transform.
   This means that convolutions are <em>closed under composition</em>.  In
   particular, linear time-invariant transforms of <em>discrete</em> signals
   can be represented by convolution with <em>discrete</em> kernels, and the
   kernel representing the composition of some discrete kernels has a
   length that is the <em>sum</em> of their lengths.  This means you can
   compose together an arbitrary sequence of convolutions into a
   single convolution, then apply that convolution in a single
   operation.  This is analogous to the closure properties of matrix
   multiplication, which is so useful to 3-D rendering; of arithmetic
   operations on the generator representation of continued fractions,
   as explained in HAKMEM, which is useful for exact arithmetic on all
   computable real numbers; and of interval arithmetic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pointwise product implementation.</strong> Convolution is homomorphic to
   pointwise product under the Fourier transform, which is to say that
   the convolution of two functions is the inverse Fourier transform
   of the pointwise products of their Fourier transforms, which means
   that convolution can perform frequency-selective filtering.  (This
   is the “convolution theorem”.).  Also,
   the Fourier transform of the pointwise product of two functions is
   the convolution of their Fourier transforms, which you can
   intuitively derive from the angle-sum trigonometric identities, and
   which gives rise to useful properties like superheterodyning and
   the limited bandwidth of the sidebands of amplitude modulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commutativity</strong>.  When the underlying pointwise multiplication
   operation is commutative, convolution is commutative.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of the product-multiplication property, the convolution <code>f*g</code>
of kernels <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> will not contain any frequencies that are not
present in both <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>.  (This may be useful for optimizing the
implementation of the convolution operation by computing with
downsampled versions of the kernel.)</p>
<p>Entirely in the domain of time-domain signal processing, you could
imagine an evaluator for a complex expression DAG of convolution
operations, discrete samples, repetition operations, weighted sums,
delay operations, and domain restriction that used strategies similar
to those of a SQL query optimizer to find an efficient evaluation
strategy for the expression within specified precision and performance
constraints, using any number of the AI search techniques mentioned
above.  I don’t think anyone has done this yet; typically the
evaluation strategy is programmed manually by some dude in Matlab.</p>
<p>Convolution is used in particular for signal filtering (including
image blurring and sharpening) and for simulating the effect of some
physical system, whether optical, electrical, or audio, in particular
including audio reverberation.</p>
<p>But there are domains a bit outside of what we usually think of as
signal processing that could also benefit from convolution.</p>
<p>You can synthesize a xylophone tune by convolving the score, a time
and frequency representation composed of impulses whose dependent
variable is note volume, with a instrument patch, and extracting the
frequency=0 slice.  If frequency is represented using
equal-temperament semitones, other parallel slices are transpositions.</p>
<p>The scores for some simple kinds of canons are the convolution of the
score for the dux with a repetition and transposition function.</p>
<p>If, instead of using impulses, you use white noise all along the
duration of a note, you can synthesize some kinds of sustained
instruments, like violin and pipe organ, from windowed samples.</p>
<p>Instead of compositing the “glyphs” of a “sound font” into a temporal
representation, you can composite the glyphs of a font into a window
by convolving the font with a signal whose (x, y, glyph-id) impulses
place and color individual glyphs.  If you composite them into a 3-D
opacity field instead, then you can get font resizing, drop shadows,
pen width and shape, crude bolding, and glyph composition from
features such as serifs, stems, and stroke thicknesses into the
bargain, if you add an additional dimension of feature type or stroke
thickness.</p>
<p>Similarly, an animation could convolve cels with (x, y, z, t) paths,
perhaps followed by the same kind of 3-D or 2½D projection to provide
opacity.  It might be desirable to do the convolution in a space with
five to seven dimensions, perhaps including rotation or even
stretching, in order to express more of the desirable operations of
animation.</p>
<p>A potential great advantage of this kind of unified convolutional
architecture is that it is relatively practical to allow the user to
ask “Why?” about a thing they see and get a reasonably comprehensible
answer, without incorporating a lot of special-purpose mechanisms for
answering “Why?” in each case.</p>
<p>Much of the above might not be practical with existing convolution
code optimized for discrete samples, high density, and low
dimensionality, but techniques based on interval arithmetic, query
optimizers, and/or automatic differentiation (see above) could make
them practical.</p>
<p><em>Discrete</em> convolution is an operation built from two fundamental
operations, multiplication of corresponding elements and summing the
products.  The associativity property that give rise to its closure
under composition would seem to require some kind of algebraic ring to
operate over, although I don’t know that it depends on <em>all</em> of the
ring postulates.  Schönhage–Strassen multiplication is one application
of convolution over a finite ring ℤ/nℤ (i.e. the Galois field GF(pⁿ)),
but we could also imagine, for example, computing a convolution over
quaternions or 4×4 matrices representing three-dimensional
transformations.  (Such a convolution is not commutative.  Can you
compute it with the Fourier-transform trick anyway?)</p>
<p>But what about other data structures commonly used in programming?
Can convolution be applied productively to things like polynomials,
bits, strings, lists, binary relations, and finite maps (dicts), with
some other operations standing in for multiplication and addition?</p>
<p>The most common example is Elias and Viterbi’s convolutional coding
for error correction, which XORs together certain plaintext bits from
a sliding window to produce coded bits.  A 1:1 convolutional code is
exactly a convolution of a bitvector kernel with the plaintext, using
AND and XOR (which are multiplication and addition in ℤ/2ℤ), but by
itself is useless; the normal procedure is to interleave several such
1:1 codes, so that one bit from each code forms a “codeword”.  (And
then, typically, you throw away some of the bits.)</p>
<p>You could, again, consider the different kernels to be displaced along
an axis perpendicular to the text, and then two-dimensional
convolution in the bit ring produces the bits of the convolutional
code spread out on a two-dimensional plane.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.math.nthu.edu.tw/~amen/2011/101219-4.pdf">http://www.math.nthu.edu.tw/~amen/2011/101219-4.pdf</a> is about
“polynomial division by convolution” XXX</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22683195/boolean-convolution-algorithm">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22683195/boolean-convolution-algorithm</a>
XXX points out that you can convolve bitvectors in O(N log N) time by
using the number-theoretical transform (FFT in ℤ/nℤ) for a ring size
larger than the shorter vector, and then saturate the results a the
end.</p>
<p><a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/10237/does-the-convolution-theorem-apply-to-weaker-algebraic-structures">http://mathoverflow.net/questions/10237/does-the-convolution-theorem-apply-to-weaker-algebraic-structures</a>
says, “it is a major open question in discrete algorithms as to which
algebraic structures admit fast convolution algorithms and which do
not.” ... “A substantially subquadratic algorithm for (min,+)
convolution would (to my knowledge) imply a subcubic algorithm
all-pairs shortest paths in general graphs, a longstanding open
problem.”  Also mentions infimal convolution.</p>
<h3>Optimizing compilers to machine code</h3>
<p>Optimizing compilers are of course a standard tool in the programmer’s
toolkit since FORTRAN I, but usually we use them, but our programs
don’t.  But there are a lot of cases where our programs <em>could</em> use
them.</p>
<p>This is all mostly about constant-factor performance improvements, so
you might want to skip it if you don’t believe in those.</p>
<p>Suppose you’ve parsed a SQL query and derived the best query plan you
can for it, but you estimate that it’s still going to have to examine
5 million rows.  What should you do?</p>
<p>Well, one possibility is to compile your query plan into C, then
compile it into machine code with a C compiler, then run it.  TCC can
compile hundreds of lines of code per millisecond, and even GCC can
compile a few lines of code per millisecond.  The result typically is
only faster than interpreted code executed by an optimized interpreter
by constant factors, but the constant factors can be substantial, like
5 to 30.  It can make the difference between executing the SQL query
in 15 seconds and executing it in 500 milliseconds.</p>
<p>There are a couple of obstacles to using this technique ubiquitously.
One is that the result is potentially harder to debug, because of the
extra level of indirection.  Another is that if you have to write the
compiler yourself, it’s considerably harder than writing the
interpreter, especially when you have to port to a new architecture.
A third is that typically there are some fiddly bits relating to
mprotect() and runtime dependency on the compiler and getting memory
that’s both writable and executable.</p>
<p>The main one, though, is the compilation speed.  If an ad-hoc SQL
query takes 100ms to run interpreted, you can’t justify spending 200ms
in a C compiler to get it to run in some shorter time.</p>
<p>A simple technique that improves compilation speed substantially,
especially at low optimization levels, is to emit an abstract syntax
tree rather than a sequence of bytes.  This is the approach taken by
Lisp environments that provide <code>eval</code>; its argument is an
S-expression, which is essentially an AST.  Unfortunately, compiled
Lisps are usually kind of slow.  Racket and Clojure may be shaping up
to be exceptions.</p>
<p>There are several different practical ways to do this today in
different programming environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ObjectWeb2 ASM is a very widely used system for rapidly emitting JVM
  bytecode, which is then “interpreted” by compiling it to machine
  code and then, if it becomes a bottleneck, by running the bytecode
  through an optimizing compiler.</p>

<p>LLVM, although its compilation is fairly slow, was originally
  intended for this purpose, and it can still be used for it, even
  though it’s been mostly retargeted for ahead-of-time compilation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LuaJit compiles arbitrary code in a superset of Lua with many
  low-level constructs added to machine code, for amd64, i386, or ARM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TCC is very fast and supports most GCC extensions to C; it has a
  compile-into-memory mode, or you can generate a .so dynamic library
  and use <code>ldopen</code> to read it in.  The emitted code is on the order of
  5 times slower than code emitted by GCC with optimization, and only
  marginally worth than GCC without optimization.  Even GCC is capable
  of compiling a few hundred lines of code in well under a second, as
  long as you don’t <code>#include</code> big header files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even compiling machine code into memory yourself isn’t that hard,
  though it’s nonportable; you can implement a simple system in C in a
  few hours and a few hundred lines of code.  It’s handy to use <code>gcc
  -fverbose-asm -Wa,-adhln=foo.lst foo.c</code> in order to see what
  constructs GCC generates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>eval</code> in PyPy also compiles Python code into optimized machine
  code, and MyHDL uses this to get enormous speedups for simulating
  digital hardware.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, compilers are related to nearly everything else I’ve been
talking about.</p>
<p>Memoization is such a helpful technique for compilers that we’ve been
caching compiler output for decades (using automatic dependency
tracking and deterministic rebuilding), and <code>ccache</code> is a
content-addressable blob store for memoizing C compiler output.  A lot
of the tradeoffs with compilation speed become less of a problem if
you can memoize the compilation result, like a cached SQL query plan.</p>
<p>There has been experimental work on building distributed compilers
that save the optimizations they’ve discovered in a common
optimization store so that they can be reused later without having to
search for them.  (I forget who wrote that paper.)  Users sometimes
switch browsers because of the performance of their JS compilers.
Compilers tend to be heavy users of pointers, and they tend to not
have to run under strict deadlines or tight resource constraints, so
FP-persistent data structures are a good fit for them.  Incremental
compilers, which would only recompile the part of your code that you’d
edited, used to be popular; of course, it can be difficult to
efficiently identify which part that was, and perhaps rolling hashes
can help.  (Incremental linkers are still popular, and the boundary
between compilers and linkers is somewhat fluid.)  Compilers
frequently use backtracking search and constraint solving to find
applicable optimizations, and memoized backtracking gives us PEG
parsing.  Nondeterministic search over compiler executions (or,
rather, interpreter optimizations) is what miniKanren uses to
automatically generate programs with certain properties.  Not only can
you use partial evaluation to implement a compiler; you can also use a
compiler to implement partial evaluation.  Indeed, there is a very
fine line between compilers from a language into itself and partial
evaluators.  Some virtual machines, like QEMU (by the author of TCC),
are implemented largely as compilers from the machine code of the
guest machine into the machine code of the host machine.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
