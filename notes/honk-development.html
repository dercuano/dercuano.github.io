(2 minutes)</div><p>As I listened to a car honking its horn for a long period of time far
away with no pause, I noticed that the quality of the sound changed
subtly several times over the first second or two.  I think this is a
result of echoes: at first I heard only the incident horn, but after a
short time it was joined by one, two, three, several echoes of the
original horn.  Depending on the particular details of the time
delays, some of the harmonics in each echo interfered constructively
with those in the original sound, while others interfered
destructively.</p>
<p>Aside from what this implies about what we can learn about our built
environment from analyzing the sound, it occurred to me as being a
very easy effect to simulate; this took me about 15 minutes:</p>
<pre><code>/* ./horn | aplay */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

typedef uint8_t u8;

u8 wave(long long t)
{
  return (t &amp; 128 ? 256 - (t &amp; 255) : 128 + (t &amp; 127)) &gt;&gt; 1;
}

u8 horn(long long t)
{
  enum { attack = 600 };
  int v = t &lt; 0 ? 0 : t &gt; attack ? 256 : t * t * 256 / attack / attack;
  return wave(t) * v &gt;&gt; 8;
}

int main()
{
  for (int a = 0; a &lt; 32000; a++) {
    putchar(horn(a - 1000)
            + (horn(a - 6242) * 64 &gt;&gt; 8)
            + (horn(a - 8932) * 32 &gt;&gt; 8)            
            + (horn(a - 12333) * 64 &gt;&gt; 8)            
            + (horn(a - 3013) * 128 &gt;&gt; 8)
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The waveform of the sound doesn’t sound very much like a horn, but the
changes in the tonal quality over time are similar to what I was
hearing.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/dsp.html">Digital signal processing (DSP)</a> (60 notes)
