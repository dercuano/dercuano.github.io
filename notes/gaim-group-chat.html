(3 minutes)</div><p>So I want to make a Gaim (um, I mean Pidgin) extension for group
activities such as games.  The first activity, of course, is group
chat.  So here are some thoughts on how to achieve that.</p>
<p>People on the channel are connected in some sort of connected graph
and relay broadcast messages to each other.  The graph doesn't need to
be acyclic; every message has a unique ID and everyone's client
remembers the unique IDs of the messages they've seen recently, and
only forwards on or displays new messages.  Eventually, every message
should traverse every link that is live at the time in one direction
or the other.</p>
<p>The first question is how much the people should be allowed to know
about each other.  Of course since they can send broadcast messages
visible to one another, they can establish communications if they
want; if my client colludes with someone, they can snoop on the
channel without anyone else being able to find out that they are
there; and if my client colludes with someone, my client can tell them
all the people I'm talking to.  So, in the framework above, there's no
way to enforce either a policy of anonymity or the opposite in the
protocol; the question is just what the default and advertised policy
should be.</p>
<p>I think I will start with revealing the truenames of everyone on the
channel --- truenames being something like "ksitaker on AOL" ---
because it has four advantages.  It makes it difficult to censor or
falsify the utterances of a particular person when others can contact
them directly; it can allow the channel to heal when somebody goes
offline unexpectedly; it facilitates side-channel conversations; and
it reduces the probability of accidentally saying something in front
of the wrong person.</p>
<p>The conversations ought to be private, in the sense that the default
should be that chat lines aren't transmitted unencrypted and aren't
forwarded to unannounced third parties.</p>
<p>The encryption is a bit tricky.  There are three straightforward
possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encrypt point-to-point between connected clients;</li>
<li>Encrypt each message with a fresh "session key" and include copies
   of the "session key" encrypted with the public key of each
   participating client;</li>
<li>Negotiate a shared "session key" periodically (at least every time
   group membership changes) and encrypt all messages with that.</li>
