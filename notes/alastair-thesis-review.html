(1 minute)</div><p>Reading Alastair Porter's master's thesis.</p>
<p>It provides a comprehensive overview of how current audio
fingerprinting algorithms work, what they are used for (both for good
and for evil), and a more detailed comparison of the open-source
Echoprint and Chromaprint algorithms and an open-source Matlab
implementation of the Landmark or Shazam algorithm.</p>
<p>It's a gold mine of references to things I didn't know about, or that
I hadn't heard of before Alastair told me about them: mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients, the freesound archive, the Shazam and
Soundhound smartphone apps for song identification, the three
open-source audio fingerprinting algorithms he evaluated, a list of
other companies that do audio fingerprinting, the Fourier-Mellin
transform, an adaptive FFT, Query By Humming, the Codaich dataset, the
Acoustid and Echoprint servers, etc.  Its overview of the history of
audio fingerprinting for automated censorship in Napster, YouTube, and
other applications may be shocking for those who aren't familiar with
the situation.</p>
<p>The research involved making a fingerprint database of the thirty
thousand two hundred eighty-three songs in the Codaich dataset and
running twenty thousand queries (trying to match some audio fragment)
against it.  But they didn't just do that once; they did it many times
with different fingerprinting algorithms and different kinds of
degradation on the queries.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (123 notes)
