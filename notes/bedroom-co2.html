<p>My girlfriend’s bedroom is cold in winter, so we sleep with the door
closed and the electric heater turned on, which pretty much eliminates
air circulation.  But sometimes we wake up out of breath, perhaps
because so much CO₂ has accumulated in the air.  Recent research
suggests that this is a problem for a lot of modern sleeping
arrangements, but it doesn’t usually rise to levels that cause
perceptible discomfort.  This note explores the possibilities for
solving this problem.</p>
<p>(See <a href="../notes/underground-arcology.html">Notes and calculations on building luxury underground arcologies for whoever wants them</a> for more information on the air
changes per hour needed for clean air.)</p>
<h2>The CO₂ level can get really fricking high without ventilation</h2>
<p>The bedroom is 3 m × 3 m × 4 m, and pretty much at sea level, where
the density of air is 1.2 g/ℓ (at STP, according to <a href="../notes/millikiln.html">Millikiln</a>),
so it contains about 43 kg of air.  The window seals pretty well.  We
are two people, and we commonly spend 12 hours straight in there; at
2000 kcal/day/person that’s 4000 kcal/day or 2000 kcal without opening
the door.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates, our normal energy source, are about 5 kcal/g
(21 MJ/kg), and carbohydrates all have the empirical formula CH₂O,
thus the name.  (Glucose, for example, is C₆H₁₂O₆.)  Multiplying by
the atomic weights, that’s 12 parts carbon, 2 parts hydrogen, and 16
parts oxygen, so carbohydrate is 12/30 carbon by mass.  (Protein is
similar; fat is about twice as high in carbon and also about twice as
high in energy, so the result is approximately the same.)  So that’s
about 12.5 kcal per gram of carbon (52 MJ/kg).  CO₂ is 12 parts carbon
to 32 parts oxygen, so that’s about 3.4 kcal per gram of CO₂
(14.3 MJ/kg).</p>
<p>So 2000 kcal is 590 g of CO₂, which would amount to 14000 ppm by mass,
1.4% of the air, 35 times the concentration in the outside air.  No
wonder we get uncomfortable!</p>
<p>If we wanted to use ventilation to limit the CO₂ to only 2½ times the
400 ppm in the outside air, we’d need to have only an extra 600 ppm in
the air, or 26 g CO₂, or 370 kJ, or, in archaic units, 88 kcal, which
our two human bodies emit every half-hour.  This would require roughly
two or three air changes per hour.</p>
<h2>You can suck it up with succulents, if your house doesn’t suck</h2>
<p>If you put houseplants in your bedroom to keep the CO₂ levels down
when you sleep, you may be disappointed if you are one of those people
who sleep at night, rather than during the day.  Plants convert CO₂ to
oxygen (and sugar) through photosynthesis, which only happens when the
sun is shining on them.  At night, plants oxidize sugar to survive,
just like the humans do.</p>
<p>Plants using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassulacean_acid_metabolism">crassulacean acid metabolism</a> are commonly recommended
to help with this; these are typically succulent desert plants.
Normal land plants keep their pores (“stomata”, literally “mouths”)
open during the day, allowing water to evaporate from their leaves and
keeping the plants cool.  CAM plants instead tolerate the high
temperatures, keeping their stomata tightly closed during the day.
But, like normal plants, they need sunlight and CO₂ for
photosynthesis.  So the motherfuckers open their stomata <em>at night</em>,
releasing the excess oxygen from photosynthesis, and store the CO₂ as
malic acid until daylight comes around.</p>
<p>Cacti, aloe, and pineapples are among the crassulacean acid metabolism
plants, although none of those are actually Crassulacea.  Because most
CAM plants are specialized to very dry climates, they grow very
slowly, prioritizing surviving over thriving.  This means, I suspect,
that they tend to photosynthesize very slowly.  Aloe vera might be the
best choice of CAM plant for this kind of thing.</p>
<p>The amount of CO₂ consumed is dependent on the amount of sunlight and
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetic_efficiency">photosynthetic efficiency</a> of the plant.  Typical photosynthetic
efficiency is 3%–6% at 114 kcal per mole of CO₂, which is to say, it
instead takes 1900–3800 kcal of sunlight (8–16 MJ in SI units) falling
on typical plants to reduce a mole of CO₂ (44 g).</p>
<p>So how much aloe do you need, or how much sunlight do your aloes need
to soak up during the day, in order to suck up 590 g of CO₂ per night?
Well, 590 g · 12 MJ/44 g = 161 MJ, and divided by a day, that’s
1900 W.  But how much sunlight is that?</p>
<p>Let’s figure that the “capacity factor” of photosynthesis is close to
the capacity factor for utility-scale solar photovoltaic energy in the
US, which is about 25% — that is, for every 100 watts peak of
installed solar photovoltaic generation capacity, you get on average
25 watts, due to things like the sun being on the wrong side of the
Earth half the time, and clouds, and a suboptimal sunlight angle on
your panels.  Or leaves.</p>
<p>The “solar constant” against which those theoretical numbers are
calibrated is 1000 W/m², which is about how much sunlight gets to the
bottom of Earth’s atmosphere where the humans live.  At a 25% capacity
factor, this is 250 W/m².  So you need almost 8 square meters of aloe
plants.  (And 8 square meters of sunlight to put them in.  You might
want to put them in some Radio-Flyer-style wagons so you can trundle
them out onto the patio in the daytime.)</p>
<p>So basically this approach can work, but it requires on the order of
4 m² of sunlit leaves per person, so you kind of have to design your
house around it.  I can’t do it here in my apartment (not enough
sunlit area) and neither can she.</p>
<p>If we had that much sunlight available, we might be able to store much
of its energy thermally (see <a href="../notes/household-thermal-stores.html">Household thermal stores</a>) which
would reduce our desire to keep the door closed.</p>
<h2>Scrubbers</h2>
<p>I’ve written previously in <a href="../notes/air-filter.html">Notes on a possible household air filter</a> and <a href="../notes/house-scrubber.html">House scrubber</a>
about mechanical means of removing CO₂ from the air in your house; I
will not go into more details here except to mention that it does seem
feasible, and could be retrofitted to existing sun-poor housing.</p>
<h2>A heat exchanger — a nose for the house</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.withouthotair.com/cE/page_296.shtml">David MacKay (RIP) pointed out in Without Hot Air, Section III,
chapter E</a>, the humans’ nose is a heat exchanger which reduces heat
and humidity losses to your breath, and they can install a
countercurrent heat exchanger on their houses, with the same purpose
of transporting air in and out without transporting the precious heat
along with it.  (Or, in the summer, the odious heat.)</p>
<p>Countercurrent heat exchangers (“recuperators”) have a couple of major
differences from the “regenerator” design used in Stirling engines and
the noses of the humans.  One is that, for the same efficiency, they
must be much larger, because the two working fluids in a recuperator
are in much less intimate contact than the fluid and reservoir in a
regenerator.  (However, see <a href="../notes/capillary-heat-exchanger.html">Heat exchangers modeled on retia mirabilia might reach 4 TW/m³</a> for a
design that fixes this.)  The other is that regenerators transfer not
only heat but also material between the two directions of flow.  For
example, water condenses in your nose as you exhale, then evaporates
again as you inhale.  For some applications, such as your nose, this
mass transport is essential; for others, such as transferring heat
from a sodium coolant loop to a steam coolant loop, mass transport
would be fatal.  (Regenerators also have a third difference, which is
that their flow is unidirectional and alternating rather than
continuous, which is somewhat awkward for rigid structures such as
most human bedrooms; often they are used in pairs to compensate for
this.)</p>
<p>Ventilating your house is an intermediate case: it’s not essential for
the water vapor that condenses from the outgoing air to be infused
into the incoming air, but it would be desirable, because otherwise an
aqueous human is going to want a humidifier in the bedroom.  (Maybe
hundreds of kilograms of aloes would solve this problem as well.)
This suggests that regenerators would be a better choice for this
application than recuperators.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to achieve 10 air changes per hour, <a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-change-rate-room-d_867.html">a relatively
normal number of air changes for spaces designed for the humans</a>,
and one which in this case would exceed the two or three air changes
per hour computed above.  This is 100 liters per second in the bedroom
I described.  If we want to keep air speeds below about 10 m/s to
avoid thunderous wind noise, we need to use a duct of at least about
100 mm × 100 mm in each direction.</p>
<p>This presumably means that the regenerators themselves, the pebble
beds, will be somewhat wider than 100 mm in order to have comparable
air resistance despite being full of chunks, but perhaps not much
wider:</p>
<pre><code>|         |
|    ↓    |
|   air   |
|         |

           |    ↓    |
           |         |
</code></pre>
<p>To prevent infestations like Legionnaires’ Disease, some kind of
anti-bacterial and anti-fungal treatment might need to be applied to
the chunks.  For example, you could use steel ball bearings plated
with nickel and then with copper, or (at the risk of deliquescence)
rock salt.  Some kind of gravel — say, non-clumping clay kitty
litter — that’s been somehow copper-plated or infused with blue
vitriol would also work.  Maybe chunks of portland cement would be
natively sufficiently alkaline to keep mold or bacteria from growing.
(The specific heat of portland cement is 0.880 J/kg/K.  Probably the
specific heat of clay kitty litter is the same as brick: 0.84 J/kg/K.)</p>
<p>(Shah and Sekulić tell me that paper, wool, hygroscopic nylon, and
polypropylene are common materials for such regenerators in HVAC
applications, and that the cycle time is frequently measured in
seconds.)</p>
<p>How small could we make the pebble beds?</p>
<p>The total thermal mass of each regenerator needs to be much larger
than the thermal mass of the air sent through it between reversals of
direction.  The amount of air sent between reversals of direction
needs to be much larger than the amount in the duct, which can be
reduced to just over the amount of air in the regenerator pebble beds
themselves by doing the reversals of direction close to those beds.
This way, if the air ducts from the regenerator to the bedroom has to
run a long distance through the house, the air in those ducts can
continue moving in the same direction.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_specific_heat_capacities">Air’s specific heat of 1.01 kJ/kg/K</a> is a bit higher than steel’s
specific heat of 0.47 kJ/kg/K, but steel’s density of 7.9 g/cc is much
higher than air’s 0.0012 g/cc.  So if the volumes of air and steel in
the pebble bed were equal, the thermal mass of the steel would be
about 3100 times greater.</p>
<p>So, presumably, whatever their size, you could send air through them
in one direction until you had sent through 150 times their volume of
air, then reverse.  So far this isn’t getting me any closer to
conclusions about how big or small the pebble beds have to be if
they’re just serving to transfer heat and humidity from outgoing air
to incoming air.</p>
<p>To take a particular size, suppose one pebble bed is 100 mm × 400 mm
in cross-section and 400 mm long, and it’s mostly full of steel shot
plated as above, close-packed as spheres, which means the spheres
occupy π/(3√2) or 74% of the space.  This is 11.9 ℓ of steel, weighing
94 kg, and holding 44 kJ/K, the same thermal mass as 44 kg of air,
roughly the entire bedroomfull.  If ΔT = 22°-10° = 12 K, this is
530 kJ, equivalent to running the 2 kW electric heater for four or
five minutes.  So this is probably overkill, by at least one and
possibly three orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Making the regenerator matrix finer increases airflow resistance but
also increases heat conduction between the mass of the matrix and the
air passing through.  Probably using parallel fins, as in corrugated
cardboard, improves this tradeoff.  Actual corrugated cardboard itself
may be a reasonable material; its specific heat should be close to
that of wood, 1–3 kJ/kg/K.</p>
<h3>Adapting a regenerator to temperature changes</h3>
<p>Sometimes we might have the heater turned off, for example because
we’re not there, and then want to turn it on.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
