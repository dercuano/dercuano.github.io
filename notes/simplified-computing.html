(22 minutes)</div><p>I’ve been thinking for some years about building a personal computing
environment up from zero: bootstrapping using an existing computer and
existing fabrication technology, but quickly getting into
self-sustaining technology, along the lines of the VPRI STEPS program
or colorForth/GreenArrays, but also along the lines of Open Source
Ecology.</p>
<p>So what is needed to, say, send an instant message to someone?  What’s
the smallest amount of code you could write to fully describe the
design of this system?</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>font</strong> to display the message in.</li>
<li>A <strong>display</strong> to show the font on, and whatever software is needed
   to talk to it.</li>
<li>A <strong>keyboard</strong> (or other input device, e.g. a touchscreen), and
   whatever software is needed to talk to it.</li>
<li>An <strong>editor</strong> that responds to the keystrokes by editing some text
   that you can later send.</li>
<li>A <strong>network interface</strong> to connect to the internet, and whatever
   software is needed to talk to it.</li>
<li>Enough of <strong>TCP/IP</strong> to speak whatever messaging protocol you’re
   using.</li>
<li>A <strong>user interface shell</strong> to allow you to choose between doing
   instant messaging and other things.</li>
<li>A <strong>CPU and RAM</strong> to run all this software on.</li>
<li>A <strong>filesystem</strong> to store your instant message logs, buddy list,
   driver code, font, editor and other UI code, and so on in.</li>
<li>A <strong>durable storage device</strong> to persist your filesystem to when
    the machine is turned off.  This might be core, Flash, MRAM, disk,
    cassette tape, barcodes, battery-backed SRAM, or cuneiform, but
    you do need <em>something</em>.</li>
<li>A <strong>low-level programming language</strong> with a compiler to write the
    drivers in.  Ideally this language is powerful enough to write the
    compiler in too, as well as the UI code, filesystem, and so on,
    but there really aren’t any existing languages that are good at
    this.  I think ML probably comes closest, but ML memory usage is
    somewhat unpredictable (even if you use MLKit regions instead of a
    garbage collector) which means that you can’t write code for which
    failure is not an option in ML.</li>
<li>The <strong>IM client</strong> itself.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptography</strong> to keep the IMs safe.</li>
<li>Probably a <strong>semiconductor fabrication system</strong> to make the CPU
    and RAM.</li>
<li>Materials processing machines for <strong>smelting, measuring, and
    purifying</strong> the materials needed for the CPU, RAM, keyboard,
    display, and the materials processing machines themselves,
    starting from raw materials.</li>
<li><strong>Digging machines</strong> for extracting the raw materials.</li>
<li><strong>Fabrication robots</strong> for making the display and keyboard and for
    assembling the computers.</li>
<li><strong>Energy-harvesting machinery</strong> for deriving energy from the
    environment to run all the other machinery.</li>
<li><strong>Waste recycling systems</strong> to keep the materials processing and
    especially the semiconductor fabrication from poisoning people,
    animals, and plants.</li>

<h2>Font</h2>
<p>So far, despite various experiments, the simplest way I’ve found to
design a readable font is as a fixed-width pixel grid.  Here’s a
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dofonts-1k.html">minimal implementation</a>
of ASCII text rendering with an included 4×6 font in 1K of DHTML,
including the font itself as a PNG:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body bgcolor="black" onload="r()"&gt;

<p>Other experiments I’ve tried include Hershey-like line fonts,
spline-based fonts, fonts scanned from paper, and so on, but I haven’t
been able to get any of these implementations down to a kilobyte, or
even nearly so.  You could maybe argue that I’m unreasonably
leveraging bitblit and PNG-decompression here, but I don’t think those
actually make a whole lot of difference.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>The current standard is an LED-backlit LCD with diffraction gratings
to give color to RGB subpixels.  This may not be the least demanding
possible way to display pictures under computer control; it seems
likely that some kind of cathode-ray tube may be simpler to construct.</p>
<h3>Spark gaps and spinning mirrors</h3>
<p>Perhaps the electronically-controlled display with the least stringent
demands on metallurgy and the like would be a small array of tiny
carbon arc lamps or spark plugs controlled at near-megahertz
frequencies, viewed through a system of spinning mirrors like the ones
used in supermarket barcode scanners in order to scan the image of the
arc across your field of view, and color-filtered both to eliminate
harmful ultraviolet light and to improve contrast.</p>
<p>Suppose you use just an X-axis scanning mirror, with one spark gap per
scan line, and you want minimally 200 scan lines (25 lines of readable
8-scan-line text or 33 lines with the less-readable 4×6 font above).
A 16-faceted mirror spinning on an air bearing at 32000 rpm, as
Michelson used in his 1877–1931 experiments to measure the speed of
light, scans at 8528 frames per second.  We only really need about 24
frames per second to be readable, even though that’s kind of flickery,
and you could do that with 1.5 revolutions per second of a 16-faceted
mirror, 90 rpm.  This is an easily achievable rotational speed even if
you’re turning the mirror by hand.</p>
<p>Square pixels at 200 scan lines and a 4:3 aspect ratio would be 266
pixels per line; 16:9 would be 355 pixels per line; a 5×8 font at the
traditional 80 columns would require 400 pixels per line.  266 pixels
in 1/24 of a second is 6384 pixels per second per spark gap, or 157μs
of cool-down time; 400 pixels is 104μs (9600Hz).  Spark times like
these are easily achievable.  Neon glow discharge lamps can easily
reach this régime, and they last for decades of continuous use and
don’t pollute the air, unlike carbon-air arcs.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-gap_flash">Edgerton was achieving 500ns air-gap spark times in the
1950s</a> by using a thin
layer of air as the plasma medium and cooling it with a quartz
heatsink, but I think much higher speeds are achievable if the spark
just needs to be <em>visible</em> rather than illuminating its surroundings
brightly enough for photography.</p>
<p>A 500ns spark could potentially paint 2 million pixels in a second, or
33,333 pixels in the 16⅔ms of a 60fps frame, not quite enough for a
text display by itself.  An array of 20 500ns spark gaps, assuming you
could fire them all continuously, could thus give you a ⅔Mpix display
at 60fps, nearly the 1024×768 that we’re used to.</p>
<p>At the currently popular 16:9 aspect ratio, this would be about
1075×620, so you’d need a vertical or Y scanning mirror that scanned
at 31×60Hz, or 1860Hz.  If it had 16 facets, it would need to spin at
116¼Hz, or 6975 rpm, which is totally feasible using gears and ball
bearings (not even air bearings), but a little bit tricky.  Again,
though, this is about four times slower than Michelson was spinning
mirrors nearly a century ago.</p>
<p>If, instead of scanning an entire column of 20 spark gaps across the
visible area in 20-pixel-high bands, you divided the visible area into
20 horizontal bands, each illuminated by a single spark gap, you could
have 20 facets in your visual field at once.  This allows you to use
more facets on your mirror and makes the scan lines more horizontal,
but requires careful alignment of the mirror’s phase with your
viewpoint.  It would, however, allow you to rotate your Y-scanning
mirror at only 31×60Hz÷16÷20 = 5.8125Hz or 348¾rpm.</p>
<h3>Vector displays</h3>
<p>The first graphical user interface was Sketchpad, implemented at the
end of the 1950s by Ivan Sutherland on the TX-2 at Lincoln Lab.  The
TX-2 had an attached CRT in which the CPU independently controlled the
X and Y coordinates of the electron beam, so it could draw simple
shapes on the screen at high resolution, even though it was only
capable of drawing a few tens of thousands of points per second.  Such
“vector displays” survived until the 1980s, and CAD systems of the
1970s were built on “storage tubes” that could maintain the vector
image, once drawn, for up to a few minutes, allowing very detailed
line drawings.</p>
<p>You could do the same thing with a single spark gap and two mirrors,
but this requires controlling the mirrors independently and actively,
not just scanning them at a constant speed like a raster display.  But
it would permit a useful display from a single spark gap modulated
even down at kilohertz speeds.</p>
<h3>Coil-driven mirrors</h3>
<p>Laser shows scan lasers across the screen with mirrors controlled by
galvanometers or “galvos”: electric coils that magnetically push
against a spring to bring the mirror to the desired position.  Typical
galvos are capable of “<a href="http://laserpointerforums.com/f47/question-about-galvo-speed-71998.html">20
kpps</a>”,
twenty thousand points per second, although the definition of this is
kind of dodgy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theharmonicseries.net/about.html">The Harmonic Series</a> was
a project by Brazilian artists Luisa Pereira and Manuela Donoso which
substituted regular dynamic speakers (electric coils that magnetically
push against a screen) for laser-show galvos, getting bandwidths of up
to several kilohertz for displaying audio Lissajous patterns, just as
Lissajous himself had done with the “Lissajous apparatus” of mirrors
on tuning forks in 1857.</p>
<p>You could imagine a resonant mirror scanning system that scans in a
Lissajous pattern rather than the sawtooth pattern we’re used to from
raster-scan devices; you get higher resolutions around the edges,
lower resolutions in the center, and a less regular scanning pattern
that the computer can compensate for.  However, I think the
Pythagorean sum of the scanning frequencies still limits your
resolution, equivalent to the scan frequency of the X-scanning mirror
in a traditional raster setup.  So with the 20 500ns spark gaps at
⅔Mpix at 60Hz described above, you could get by with oscillation
frequencies possibly as low as 42Hz or so.</p>
<h3>Lissajous rods</h3>
<p>A particularly simple way to achieve these Lissajous oscillations is
by using a sprung mass that is sprung with two different spring
constants in X and Y; for example, a thin rod, fixed at one end, with
a rectangular cross-section.  (There is <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/xref/exhibits/lissajous_rods.html">a Lissajous Rods
exhibit</a>
in the Exploratorium demonstrating this; the Lissajous patterns
described in the air by the shiny ends of the rods are quite
conspicuous.)</p>
<h3>Other high-speed light sources: vacuum tubes, LEDs, and lasers</h3>
<p>All of the above describes different contortions to get around the
possible slowness of a spark-gap light source, which is itself much
faster than an incandescent light.  But even normal vacuum tubes can
turn on and off in the submicrosecond regime; you could use a vacuum
tube with a phosphor-coated anode to modulate light output with
deep-submicrosecond times.  There are a number of electron-excited
phosphors with single-digit nanosecond decay times, hundreds of times
faster than an air-gap flash, including CdS:In and ZnO:Ga.</p>
<p>(If you’re using a vector display to draw relatively static images, a
long phosphorescence time might be an advantage rather than a
disadvantage.)</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes and exotic phosphors, though, may be hard to fabricate;
and if you can fabricate them, it may be more practical to just
fabricate a CRT rather than some kind of electromechanical display.</p>
<p>Another possibility, since we’re already taking for granted
semiconductor fabrication, is LEDs.  These are semiconductor diodes
made of exotic large-bandgap semiconductors, and, <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.1954.pdf">with carefully
designed driver circuitry, even regular LEDs can have response times
measured in single-digit
nanoseconds</a>.  And LEDs are much,
much more durable than spark gaps.  They were first reported in 1927,
using point-contact diodes with low-purity silicon carbide, but <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/1/4/10.1063/1.1753706;jsessionid=17lre5cf2irrn.x-aip-live-02">red
LEDs were first published in
1962</a>
in gallium arsenide phosphide; they became commercially available in
quantity in 1968.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode#Colors_and_materials">Other red and green LED
chemistries</a>
include AlGaAs, AlGaInP, and GaP; InGaN and GaN additionally provide
green, blue, and violet LEDs, but these were not possible to
manufacture until 1994, and the discovery won a Nobel Prize in
physics.</p>
<p>Once you, hypothetically, can make LEDs, making semiconductor lasers
is relatively straightforward.  This has the advantage that you can
scan them over a large surface using mirrors to produce a
high-resolution projection display.</p>
<p>Also, lasers in general have the ability to produce shorter light
pulses than other light sources: once a population inversion forms,
stimulated emission can deplete it, and so a wave packet generated by
a mirrorless laser can be very short indeed, the so-called
“femtosecond laser”, when the laser has a large tunable bandwidth.
You should be able to trigger the generation of a pulse by dumping a
bunch more energy into a barely-subcritical laser, which is more or
less how erbium-doped fiber amplifiers work.  (This is my vague
understanding of this shit; don’t bet on it.)  So it should be
possible to</p>
<p>One possible way to rapidly scan temporally-modulated LED light over
an area would be to use a transparent Lissajous rod elastically
vibrating; it could be made of, for example, polished glass or
acrylic, using total internal reflection to guide the light to its
vibrating tip.</p>
<h3>High-speed light modulation: LCDs</h3>
<p>LCDs do not emit light, but they can <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/58583">switch on and off in tens of
nanoseconds</a>
using current techniques.  I don’t know if LCDs are less demanding to
fabricate than LEDs, but I suspect so, even though they were developed
later.</p>
<h3>Slow displays: in the limit you get a printer</h3>
<p>Above, I’ve mentioned the benefits of slowness a couple of times: if
your image lasts a long time, you can use even very slow methods for
producing it.  The Tektronix 4014 storage tube was one example: used
for high-resolution CAD drawings despite being connected to the
computer over a low-speed serial link.  But even a regular
long-persistence phosphor would work reasonably well, without the
storage-tube aspect; in fact, if you’re using mirrors to steer a beam
of light rather than an electron beam, you could draw the image on a
phosphor screen of, for example, copper-activated zinc sulfide, which
is sphalerite/wurtzite, the main ore of zinc in nature.</p>
<p>But you can go slower still.  A lot of Unix was developed on Teletypes
running at 110 baud, which worked out to 11 characters per second; a
4×6 dot-matrix printer at this speed needs to run its 6 hammers at
44Hz, which is quite reasonable.  And if you go vector instead of
raster, you get a pen plotter.</p>
<h2>Smelting, measuring, and purifying elements</h2>
<p>Both current and prehistoric metallurgy depends mostly on iron,
aluminum, copper, zinc, tin, and lead; nuclear energy production
depends on uranium or thorium.  Semiconductor fabrication also depends
on silicon, plus trace amounts of dopants, such as boron and arsenic,
as well as processing chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen
peroxide.  Refractory materials are essential to many processes
listed.</p>
<p>Small amounts of iron, lead, and especially copper are found “native”
on Earth, while aluminum, zinc, tin, and thorium are always found in
compounds.  Nevertheless, for bootstrapping, it’s probably necessary
to be able to refine these elements from soil.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust">Earth’s crust is about 28%
silicon</a>.,
and it’s in almost all soils, so anywhere you go, you have silicon.
Although you can smelt metallurgical-grade silicon from silica in an
arc furnace with carbon at 1900°, smelting it for semiconductors is
hell, since you need to get impurities down to &lt;1ppb in order to
control its semiconducting properties, using either CVD from
trichlorosilane or repeated zone melting.  Even less-demanding
photovoltaic silicon needs &lt;1ppm impurities.</p>
<p>Earth’s crust is about 8% aluminum, which, too, is everywhere; but
it’s difficult to smelt because aluminum dioxide (sapphire) is so
stable.  The Hall-Héroult process, orders of magnitude cheaper than
the alternative smelting processes, revolutionized the production of
aluminum.  This involves dissolving corundum (aluminum oxide) in
cryolite (sodium aluminum fluoride) and calcium fluoride at 980° in
order to be able to electrolyze it.</p>
<p>Earth’s crust is about 5% iron.  People have been smelting iron from
hematite and magnetite using charcoal in bloomery furnaces for
millennia, but blast furnaces are much more efficient and produce much
better iron.</p>
<p>Earth’s crust is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc#Occurrence">about 60 ppm
zinc</a>, mostly as
sphalerite, which can be purified by froth flotation; roasting
sphalerite in air at at least 690° produces SO₂ and ZnO, and the ZnO
can be reduced to Zn either with C (which was done accidentally for
centuries, producing Zn vapor) or by electrowinning from water-soluble
ZnSO₄ (low-current-density process: 10% H₂SO₄, aluminum cathodes,
275–325 A/m², 30–35°).  Historically this smelting was done in
hermetic clay retorts to prevent the zinc vapor from escaping.</p>
<p>Earth’s crust is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper#Occurrence">about 50 ppm
copper</a>.</p>
<p>Earth’s crust is about 14 ppm lead.</p>
<p>Earth’s crust is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occurrence_of_thorium">about 6 ppm
thorium</a>, but you
don’t need very much thorium, because burning thorium in a nuclear
reactor produces about 79 TJ/kg of energy.</p>
<p>Earth’s crust is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin#Occurrence">about 2 ppm
tin</a>, which makes it
hard to extract.</p>
<h3>Plasma pyrolysis and oxide distillation</h3>
<p>One possible answer to the problem of extracting various elements from
the complex mix of mineral compounds in soil is, rather than using
individual reactions customized for each separate ore, simply vaporize
the whole shebang into a plasma, mix with oxygen, and then distill out
the various oxides.  Even tungsten, tantalum, rhenium, and osmium boil
below 6000°, and every other element below 5000°; everything melts far
below this temperature, with tantalum hafnium carbide melting at
3942°.</p>
<p>So, if you can heat soil up to 6000°, you can probably get them to mix
with a large volume of preheated oxygen and oxidize them fully.  You
should be able to start the process with a plasma arc torch (regular
plasma arc welding torches reach 28000°), then continue heating with
inductively-coupled plasma heating.  Various companies are currently
developing lower-temperature variants of this process under the name
“plasma arc recycling” or “plasma gasification”; Westinghouse’s
process runs at only 3000°.</p>
<p>As an alternative to inductive heating of the plasma, you can
illuminate it; well-ionized plasmas absorb light fairly well.
Sunlight can be focused on the plasma using non-imaging optics, which
have been demonstrated to reach 84000 suns, 59 megawatts per square
meter.</p>
<p>Another alternative means of heating the plasma after initial
ionization might include mixing carbon or hydrogen fuel into the
feedstock.  In theory, hydrogen ought to be able to raise the
temperature by about 2800° in the limit of 100% hydrogen.</p>
<p>The mix of oxygen and fairly inert simple elemental oxides coming out
of the torch then needs to be distilled.  Each oxide has its own
characteristic condensation temperature, so you should be able to
condense thoria in one chamber, silicon dioxide in another, aluminum
oxide in another, zinc oxide in a fourth, and so on.  You probably
need to do this under low pressure to keep the plasma from cooling
down too much before depositing its condensates.</p>
<p>How much energy does this need? <a href="http://www.ing.unibs.it/~beretta/www.JamesKeckCollectedWorks.org/JCKeck-papers/EisazadehFarMetghalchiKeck-JEnergyResTechnol-133-2011.pdf">Heat capacity of plasmas is
complicated</a>
but generally around 100 kJ/(kmol·K) in the temperature range we’re
considering, so heating by 6000 K should require about 600MJ/kmol.  If
we figure that the majority of the plasma is oxygen, then each mole is
16 grams, so we need up to about 40MJ/kg to heat the plasma, some of
which we may be able to recover as we cool it back down.</p>
<p>Supposing we mix oxygen with the vaporized soil in a 4:1 ratio by
mass, we’re spending 200 MJ per kg of soil, or 33 TJ per kg of
thorium, assuming that our soil is only averagely rich in thorium.
That’s less than half of the energy that thorium will produce in a
reactor, which still leaves us precariously net positive, but suggests
that some monazite deposits (about 10% thorium, i.e. 100 000 ppm, five
orders of magnitude above average) would go a long way.  (It’s also
possible that the modal thorium concentration is well below the mean,
which would mean that most points on the globe had thorium
concentrations too low for purification by this method to be a net
energy producer.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
