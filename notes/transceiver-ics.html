(5 minutes)</div><p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/freescale-semiconductor-nxp/MKW01Z128CHN/MKW01Z128CHN-ND/4746295">US$4.01 NXP MKW01Z128</a> that Bill Paul mentioned.
This chip’s RF interface is really interesting because it can transmit
license-free as low as 290 MHz (1.03 m) at up to 600 kbps.  It has
128 KiB of Flash and 16 KiB of RAM and a 48 MHz Cortex-M0, sucking
16 mA when actively receiving (and up to 95 mA when transmitting) at
1.8 to 3.6 volts.  It's targeted at last-mile metering and wireless
sensor networks.</p>
<h2>Radio communications characteristics</h2>
<p>Its power output is -18 to 17 dBm (50 mW!) and its sensitivity is
-120 dBm (a femtowatt!) and so it occurred to me that maybe we should
measure solid angles in dB.  In this case, without further
amplification, the receive antenna needs to capture signal over -137
dB (or more) of the sphere around an isotropic transmit antenna.</p>
<p>(The -120 dBm is dependent on lowering the communication rate to
1200 bps.)</p>
<p>A half-wave dipole antenna, the ideal, would be 516 mm long for 290
MHz; it gives you 2.15 dBi of “antenna gain”, so you get down to a
solid angle of -139 dB, and it captures signal over about 0.2 m², I
think.  This subtends -139 dB of solid angle at about 1000 km.</p>
<p>That’s pretty impressive — two such chips can communicate over 1000 km
with nothing between them but half-wave dipoles, and furthermore
without a license.</p>
<p>On Spaceship Earth, though, it’s a little tricky to have nothing
between them, and 1000 km is far too short for moonbounce.  If you
were to use a 30 dBi dish antenna to transmit, that would get you to
about 30 000 km, which isn’t even all the way around Spaceship Earth;
if you use another one to receive, that gets you to 900 000 km, which
is far enough for moonbounce — but then you only have about 3 dB of
headroom, and the moon sucks most of that up; typical moonbounce path
losses are around 240 dB.</p>
<p>The 315 MHz UHF unlicensed (ultra-low-power/short-range device in US
and Japan, not ITU) frequency band it uses (which extends down to 290
mHz, at the top of the VHF band) is mostly used by garage door
openers, keyless car openers, and whatnot.  It should have reasonable
building penetration, better than cellphone signals.</p>
<p>E-skip ionospheric propagation apparently doesn’t reach 290 MHz
(250 MHz seems to be the limit), but it might be subject to
tropospheric ducting from atmospheric temperature inversions, and to
transequatorial propagation, and otherwise is limited to 3570 m √(h/m)
line-of-sight radio horizon.  Reaching 1000 km with 3570 m √(h/m)
would require a stratospheric balloon or drone at 79 km altitude.  A
terrestrial structure like my office at about 60 m only has a line of
sight of around 30 km.  (Probably all the people remotely unlocking
their cars would provide too much interference, but maybe not.)
Totally unsurprising structures like trees might be only 10 m tall,
and thus have a line of sight up to about 10 km.</p>
<p>Tropospheric ducting, if it’s possible, has the additional advantage
that the strength of radio waves trapped in the atmospheric duct only
drops off as the reciprocal of distance, rather than its square.</p>
<p>If you were to try to do something cute and moonbouncelike, maybe you
could use a mountain.  For example, a few kilometers from Las Cruces,
Organ Needle reaches 2700 m above sea level, while Las Cruces itself
is at only 1200 m.  A dish (or radome) pointed at Organ Needle would
effectively transmit isotropically from 1500 m, giving it a
line-of-sight range of over 100 km, as long as the reflected power was
high enough.</p>
<h2>Power usage</h2>
<p>16 mA × 3.6 V / 48 MHz works out to about a nanojoule per instruction.
95 mA × 3.6 V / 600 kbps works out to 570 nJ per bit.</p>
<p>17 mA at 1.8 volts is roughly the power supplied by the solar cell
from a solar calculator, and just about at the right voltage already;
two such cells in series with a capacitor ought to provide plenty of
power for the device as long as it’s only transmitting with a
relatively light duty cycle.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
