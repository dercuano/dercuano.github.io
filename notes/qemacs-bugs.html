(2 minutes)</div><p>I downloaded and built QEmacs.  It's a good enough Emacs I could almost use it!
Which is inspiring, since it was an individual spare-time project by one
person, even if that one person is Fabrice Bellard.  So I thought I'd take some
notes on its deficiencies to see if it's fixable, or how much more work would
be needed to make something really usable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crashes sometimes in help.  Open qe_g, C-h b q</li>
<li>
<p>open a C file and type</p>
<p>typedef struct node {</p>
<p>and QEmacs takes you to the beginning of the line. Follow that up with
<code>enum {</code> and it happens again.</p>
<p>Type <code>typedef int buf[4];</code> and it happens again. I think this is just
part of a general problem it has with indenting C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, it can open a text file of nearly 300 megabytes. But going to the end
  of the file is slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doesn't support M-^, M-;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C-x C-e (compile) tries to execute the make command in the directory where
  qemacs started, not where the file is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>repeated C-k doesn't append to the latest kill-ring item as it should, so
  you can't use it to cut blocks of text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M-q takes you out of your paragraph, so you can't just keep typing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redisplay is visibly slow and not double-buffered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doesn't support ~ in filenames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doesn't support M-/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control-backspace is "help" instead of "backward-kill-word".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there's pending keyboard input, it wastes time updating the screen
  with already-stale state!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undo works in individual buffer changes, rather than commands, which is
  quite suboptimal with M-q and also with undoing typing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doesn't support prefix arguments. M-5 M-6 M-g prompts you for a line
  number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M-y (yank-pop) causes subsequent C-y to yank the same thing. Maybe this is
  an improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, it's impressive how much like Emacs it can feel with only 88 commands!</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
