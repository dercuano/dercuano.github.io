(2 minutes)</div><p>Plastic bottlecaps are mostly compatible with each other because their
threads conform to a standard called PCO 1810, or occasionally PCO 28,
which is being <a href="http://www.imajeenyus.com/mechanical/20120508_bottle_top_threads/index.shtml">gradually replaced</a> by a newer standard called PCO
1881.  These threads are formed into the bottleneck (called a
“finish”) before the shape
of the rest of the bottle is formed; companies like <a href="http://www.jesper-preform.com/style/frame/templates6/product.asp?lang=2&amp;customer_id=1723&amp;content_set=color_6&amp;name_id=59695&amp;rid=59525">Jesper PET
Preform</a> will sell you the bottle “preform”, with the thread formed
but the rest of the bottle uninflated; then it’s up to you to
blow-mold the bottle into the shape you want.</p>
<p>The bottle caps (called “closures”) are sold separately, and they’re
usually made of polypropylene (“PP”).</p>
<p>PCO 1881 has a slightly shorter neck (<a href="http://bestinpackaging.com/2009/11/04/short-shorter-the-shortest/" title="“Short, Shorter, the Shortest”, by Anton Steeman, on 2009-11-04 in Best In Packaging">17mm instead of 21mm</a>) and
was finalized in 2009 by the <a href="http://www.bevtech.org/">International Society of Beverage
Technologists</a>.  It apparently implies no loss in performance
compared to the PCO-1810 standard, despite the steeper thread pitch
and the threads going around only twice instead of the three times you
see on PCO-1810 bottles.</p>
<p>Because the bottle neck and cap are so much thicker than the rest of
the plastic bottle, they account for a substantial fraction of the
material use in the bottle, so the <a href="http://www.packagingmag.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=320:the-long-and-the-short-of-it&amp;catid=95:issue-july-2011&amp;Itemid=346" title="“The long and the short of it”, in the July 2011 issue of Packaging &amp; Print Media">1.4 gram reduction due to the
4mm-shorter PCO-1881 standard amounts to 27%</a> of the total weight of
the PET bottle, not counting the cap.</p>
<p>ISBT has put the <a href="http://www.imajeenyus.com/mechanical/20120508_bottle_top_threads/pco1810.pdf">PCO-1810 standard</a> and the <a href="http://www.imajeenyus.com/mechanical/20120508_bottle_top_threads/28mm-ISBT-PCO-1881-Finish-3784253-17.pdf">PCO-1881 standard</a>
engineering drawings <a href="http://www.threadspecs.com/threadspecs-downloads.asp">online along with their other standards</a>, and
“ippe” <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35907">posted an STL file on Thingiverse</a> that prints to a working
PCO-1810 bottle closure at least in PLA on the Prusa Mendel I have
access to.  (You may want to turn that file upside down for printing
if you want it to seal, though; the top was too long a horizontal span
to cohere properly.)</p>
<p>In addition to the preforms, you can buy entire preblown bottles if
you don't have blow molding (“pressure molding”) equipment; a 43-gram
1ℓ bottle costs <a href="http://shop.packari.com/en/Products/Food-packaging/PET-plastic-beverage-bottles/PET-plastic-bottle-for-beverage-1000-ml-transparent-PCO-28-without-closure.html">around €0.36–€0.69</a> without the cap.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/pricing.html">Pricing</a> (89 notes)
