<h2>Forth Definite Looping Constructs</h2>
<p>I remember reading some years ago about how Chuck Moore tries to avoid
use of the "DO...LOOP" construct these days.  In
http://www.ultratechnology.com/moore4th.htm he says:</p>
<pre><code>Some of the people who don't like Forth might take to this. In 20
blocks of code I have no conditional statements or loops.  Good
Forth minimizes the number of conditional statements. The minimum
is zero.  I can say

: 5X X X X X X ;  : 20X 5X 5X 5X 5X ;

This is just as good as a loop. When running through memory the
code should compare an address to terminate rather than use a loop
count.
</code></pre>
<p>(Attributed to Chuck Moore's 1997 Silicon Valley FIG presentation:
http://www.ultratechnology.com/color4th.html)</p>
<p>This struck me as crazy, since it makes the program considerably more
opaque.</p>
<p>(In http://www.ultratechnology.com/1xforth.htm from 1999 he says he
prefers tail-recursion to other looping constructs, and much of that
is actually on display in the 1997 presentation as well.)</p>
<p>Moore has been working on top of his stack-based MuP21 and F21 CPUs
since the early 90s, or at least pretending to by emulating them with
assembler macros on Pentiums, which run a lot faster.  These chips
implement something like Forth operations as their native instruction
set.  But the run-time semantics of LOOP are not among their primitive
operations; instead there are JZ (T0), which jumps if the top-of-stack
is zero (excluding its carry bit), and JCZ (C0), which jumps if the
carry bit on the top-of-stack is zero.  (On these chips, each register
on the stack drags along its own carry bit.)</p>
<p>I've been implementing a toy Forth system myself this week, and I got
to LOOP, and you know, it's a little bit complicated.  My
implementation was something like 19 words in length.  In view of
Moore's overriding desire to get stuff done with a minimal amount of
resources, his avoidance of LOOP no longer seems quite so
incomprehensible.</p>
<p>So first I'll explain what I wrote, and then I'll show the much better
solution from F-83.</p>
<h2>What I Wrote</h2>
<pre><code>    defbytes _loop          # twiddles return address
    # ( -- ) ( R: X limit-1 limit -- X+1 ) in end-of-loop case
    # ( -- ) ( R: X counter limit -- X-N counter+1 limit ) in normal case
    # N is stored at X (in the instruction stream after
    # the call to _loop)
    # XXX we need a way to sign-extend characters; it's
    # confusing to write a positive number for a backward
    # jump.
    ## Also, this is way too long.
    .byte b_rpop, b_rpop, b_add1, b_rpop, b_twodup, b_xor
    .byte b_branch_on_0,7, b_rpush, b_rpush # not done yet, so jump back
    .byte                  b_dup, b_c_at, b_sub, b_rpush, b_exit
    .byte b_twodrop, b_add1, b_rpush, b_exit # done
</code></pre>
<p>That's hopefully equivalent to this Forth:</p>
<pre><code>: _loop r&gt; r&gt; 1+ r&gt; 2dup xor
    if &gt;r &gt;r dup c@ - &gt;r exit then
    2drop 1+ &gt;r ;
</code></pre>
<p>So it pulls its own return address off the return stack, pulls off the
loop counter and increments it, pulls off the limit, compares the
incremented loop counter to the limit, and if they're still not equal,
it pushes them both back onto the stack, then fetches a jump offset
from where its return address points and subtracts that from the
return address before sticking it back onto the stack, then returns.
But if they are equal, it throws them away, increments its return
address by one to skip over the jump offset, and sticks it back on the
return stack before returning.</p>
<p>That's a lot of work for something that has to be done inside every
tiniest little definite-iteration inner loop!</p>
<p>I tried coding an assembly version, but it was complicated too, at 14
instructions.</p>
<h2>F-83's LOOP implementation</h2>
<p>The definition of LOOP from my copy of F-83 is in screen #75 of
KERNEL86.BLK:</p>
<pre><code>: LOOP 
     COMPILE (LOOP)  2DUP 2+ ?&lt;RESOLVE ?&gt;RESOLVE    ; IMMEDIATE
</code></pre>
<p>So when you say LOOP in F-83, it compiles a call to (LOOP) into the
word you're compiling, then does some compile-time jump-resolution
stuff.</p>
<p>(LOOP) is in screen #11:</p>
<pre><code>CODE (LOOP)   (S -- )   1 # AX MOV
LABEL PLOOP   AX 0 [RP] ADD   BRAN1 JNO
  6 # RP ADD   IP INC   IP INC   NEXT END-CODE
</code></pre>
<p>(I found these by running F83.COM in DOSBOX and saying "view loop" and
"view (loop)".  There's a built-in screen editor vocabulary that I
don't really know how to use, but it brings up a screen editor on the
definitions if you say "fix loop", at which point the word "a"
switches between viewing the source code and the "shadow" block
containing the comments.)</p>
<p>I think this means the following in gas syntax:</p>
<p>_loop:  mov $1, %ax
        # RP is the return stack pointer, defined in CPU8086.BLK screen 5
ploop:  add %ax, (%bp)
        jno bran1       # jump if no overflow to "bran1"
        add $6, %bp     # pop three items from return stack
        # IP is the interpreter pointer
        inc %si
        inc %si
        next # a macro defined as &gt;NEXT #) JMP, which I assume means 
        # "jump to the address &gt;next"</p>
<p>"bran1" was previously defined in screen 9:</p>
<pre><code>CODE BRANCH   (S -- )                                           
LABEL BRAN1   0 [IP] IP MOV   NEXT END-CODE
</code></pre>
<p>which I'm pretty sure means
branch:
bran1:  mov (%si), %si
        next</p>
<p>That just fetches a new address to jump to from the place the
interpreter pointer currently points.</p>
<p>Notice how clever this is --- the common-case path length inside
(LOOP) is only three instructions: MOV, ADD, JNO; and then there's one
more MOV instruction inside BRANCH before we get to NEXT.  But it's a
little bit opaque.</p>
<p>In "Inside F-83" (insidf83.ZIP, 312170 bytes; see Chap4, 39424 bytes)
C. H. Ting explains:</p>
<pre><code>    F83 provides a solution by using three numbers on the return
    stack to handle the indexing and looping. The number at the
    bottom of the three is the address of the word right after
    LOOP, providing LEAVE with the return address to terminate the
    looping.  The second number is the loop limit, offset by 8000H
    so that the index range from 0 to FFFFH becomes contiguous.
    The top number is the difference between the index and the
    limit, also offset by 8000H.  At the end of the loop, LOOP
    increments the top number on the return stack by either one or
    the amount specified in the case of +LOOP, and tests for
    overflow from bit 14 to bit 15.  The overflow condition occurs
    when the 8000H boundary is crossed from either
    direction. Therefore, both the positive and negative
    increments are handled correctly with a single run-time loop
    routine.
</code></pre>
<p>So the loop counter is one of the largest positive integers
representable, and we increment it until it overflows.  This does
imply a bit more work on behalf of (do) though:</p>
<pre><code>CODE (DO)   (S l i -- )   AX POP   BX POP 
LABEL PDO   RP DEC   RP DEC   0 [IP] DX MOV   DX 0 [RP] MOV 
  IP INC   IP INC   8000 # BX ADD   RP DEC   RP DEC 
  BX 0 [RP] MOV   BX AX SUB   RP DEC   RP DEC   AX 0 [RP] MOV 
  NEXT END-CODE
</code></pre>
<p>If I understand this, it means</p>
<pre><code>_do:    pop %ax         # initial loop counter
        pop %bx         # loop limit
pdo:    dec %bp
        dec %bp
        mov (%si), %dx  # loop end address
        mov %dx, (%bp)
        inc %si
        inc %si
        add $0x8000, %bx # loop limit + 0x8000
        dec %bp
        dec %bp
        mov %bx, (%bp)
        sub %bx, %ax    # ax := initial loop counter - (loop limit + 0x8000)
        dec %bp
        dec %bp
        mov %ax, (%bp)
        next
</code></pre>
<p>If you're like me, when you read that code, you will shout, "What the
fuck kind of sense does that make?" and haul out your Intel
instruction set manual to see if maybe you've gotten the operands to
SUB backwards or something.  But of course the code is correct.  (Skip
the rest of this paragraph if that's already obvious to you.)  The
quantity -(loop limit + 0x8000) is the same as -0x8000 - loop limit,
and -0x8000 is 0x8000, one more than the largest representable
integer.  So if the loop limit is 1, then this quantity will be
0x7fff, which will overflow after one iteration if the initial loop
counter is 0.  If it's 2, then it will be 0x7ffe.  And so on.  So then
the "initial loop counter" is added to possibly reduce the number of
iterations of the loop.</p>
<p>I think you could write this more briefly as follows, but hey, it's
harder to build than to criticize, right?  The one difference is that
"pdo" now takes its parameters in %dx and %bx instead of %ax and %bx.</p>
<pre><code>_do:    pop %dx
        pop %bx
pdo:    xchg %sp, %bp
        lodsw
        push %ax
        add $0x8000, %bx
        push %bx
        sub %bx, %dx
        push %dx
        xchg %sp, %bp
        next
</code></pre>
<p>Needless to say, this representation of loop state requires a little
bit of computation to recover the loop counter in the word "I", in
KERNEL86.BLK screen 15:</p>
<pre><code>CODE I   (S -- n )
  0 [RP] AX MOV   2 [RP] AX ADD   1PUSH END-CODE
</code></pre>
<p>That is:</p>
<pre><code>i:      mov (%bp), %ax
        add 2(%bp), %ax
        jmp push1
</code></pre>
<p>"1push" is one byte earlier than "next" --- presumably it pushes %ax,
saving one byte on each of those primitives ("CODE words") that finish
up by pushing a result.  There's also "2push".</p>
<h2>The Carry Variant</h2>
<p>It seems like it would work just as well, and be somewhat clearer, to
use the carry flag rather than the overflow flag --- so the loop is
over when the loop counter increments up to 0.  Here's my untested
attempt at that variant:</p>
<pre><code>_loop:  mov $1, %ax
ploop:  add %ax, (%bp)
        jnc bran1
        add $6, %bp
        inc %si         # couldn't we just lodsw?
        inc %si
        next

_do:    pop %dx         # initial loop counter
        pop %bx         # loop limit
pdo:    xchg %sp, %bp
        lodsw
        push %ax
        push %bx        # loop limit
        sub %bx, %dx    # dx := initial loop counter - loop limit
        push %dx
        xchg %sp, %bp
        next

i:      mov (%bp), %ax
        add 2(%bp), %ax
        jmp push1
</code></pre>
<p>The only changes are that we JNC instead of JNOing, and we don't need
the add $0x8000.  So in the 1 0 DO LOOP case, the thing pushed on top
of the return stack will be -1, which will set the carry flag after
one iteration.</p>
<h2>The Carry Approach In High-Level Forth</h2>
<p>Suppose we wanted to implement that same approach in high-level Forth
(although without the third address on the stack for LEAVE).  Instead
of my ugly version:</p>
<pre><code>: _loop r&gt; r&gt; 1+ r&gt; 2dup xor
    if &gt;r &gt;r dup c@ - &gt;r exit then
    2drop 1+ &gt;r ;
</code></pre>
<p>we could have the nicer</p>
<pre><code>: (loop) r&gt; r&gt; 1 um+ 
    if drop rdrop 1+ &gt;r exit then    \ loop is done, or
    &gt;r dup c@ - &gt;r ;                 \ jump back and continue loop
</code></pre>
<p>in which the four normal-case instructions (mov add jno mov) of the
assembly version have become nine Forth addresses: r&gt; r&gt; 1 um+ if &gt;r
dup c@ - &gt;r.  (UM+ adds two numbers and leaves the carry on top of the
sum on the stack.)  This is slightly shorter than the 10 we had
before, and probably considerably more efficient, because (at least at
the moment, in my toy Forth) many of the words in the old version are
interpreted, while in this version, all but "1" are machine-code
primitives.  The overall length of the thing also shortens from 19
cells (or bytes, in my case) to 17.</p>
<p>(do), however, gets very slightly hairier.  My current version is as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>    defbytes _do            # 10 0 DO ... LOOP loops 0, 1...9.
    ## This works by ( limit initial -- ) ( R: X -- X initial limit )
    .byte b_swap, b_rpop, b_swap, b_rpush, b_swap, b_rpush
    .byte b_rpush, b_exit
</code></pre>
<p>(I'm writing the return stack effect with the top-of-stack on the
left, which is unorthodox.)</p>
<p>Which is like this:</p>
<pre><code>: (do)  swap  r&gt;  swap &gt;r  swap &gt;r  &gt;r ;
</code></pre>
<p>Now we want ( limit initial -- ) ( R: X -- X initial-limit limit ), so
we have</p>
<pre><code>: (do)  over -  swap  r&gt;  swap &gt;r  swap &gt;r  &gt;r ;
</code></pre>
<p>So this approach doesn't change the total program size, but it might
be faster.</p>
<h2>The Carry Approach Translated Into F21 Opcodes</h2>
<p>These "real" Forth definitions:</p>
<pre><code>: (loop) r&gt; r&gt; 1 um+ 
    if rdrop 1+ &gt;r exit then
    &gt;r dup c@ - &gt;r ;
: (do)  over -  swap  r&gt;  swap &gt;r  swap &gt;r  &gt;r ;
</code></pre>
<p>would become something like this, in the four-instruction 20-bit words
the F21 uses:</p>
<pre><code>label (loop)  pop pop # nop 
              1
              nop + c0 nop     \ jump if no carry; IIRC need NOPs before +
              cont
              pop drop drop #  \ carry, so exit loop
              1
              nop + push ret   \ 
label cont    push dup A! @A   \ fetch jump offset
              + push ret nop   \ and return to it
label (do)    pop A! over com  \ save return address in A
                               \ no swap, must use over
                               \ com is bitwise not; no subtract
              # nop + nop      \ no increment either; must use literal?
              1
              \ now we have on data stack: limit initial-limit
              + over push push \ 
              drop A push ret  \ discard extra copy of limit, return
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I've never written an actual F21 or even MuP21 program, so I may
have inflated that by a factor of two or three.  (I'm not sure where
jump targets are stored, for example, or in what format --- I assume
as the next word --- or whether # and c0 and ret abort the instruction
word, or whether there's a delay associated with memory references.)
It's 14 20-bit words as I've written it, or 35 bytes, which is a
reasonable code density --- my token-threaded Forth above makes it 27
bytes, and it's probably a bit over 35 bytes of x86 machine code.</p>
<p>But considering it from a speed point of view, it looks awful.  The
common-case path through (loop) is 15 instructions, if I counted it
correctly --- that's 30ns on a 500MHz F21.  While that compares
reasonably with the time to do an empty delay loop on a 500MHz
Pentium-II-class machine (my PIII Coppermine 700 runs x: loop x at
8.6ns per iteration) it's a heck of a lot slower than straight-line
execution.</p>
<p>As it happens, looping is also a heck of a lot slower on my PIII.
When I added four more instructions to that empty delay loop, it only
slowed down by 3ns per iteration.</p>
<p>So Chuck Moore isn't crazy after all.  He just prizes efficiency very
highly.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
