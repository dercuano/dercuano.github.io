(13 minutes)</div><p>You can use a camera to measure deep subpixel movements by using moiré
patterns generated by geometrical optics, permitting extremely
inexpensive sensing and servomechanisms with several degrees of
freedom all the way down to submicron scales.</p>
<p>Suppose you have two sheets of A4-size acetate transparency film
printed almost entirely black on a 1200-dpi printer, with occasional
randomly placed transparent pixels piercing the otherwise
uninterrupted darkness.  Specifically, about one of every 2048 pixels
is transparent; the other 2047 are opaque black.  This means that out
of all 139 million pixels on either sheet, only about 68000 are
transparent.</p>
<p>Let’s lay one of the sheets on top of the other with some integer X
and Y pixel offset between them, but no relative rotation.  The number
of possible ways we can do this is about 9900 in X and 14000 in Y for
a total of about 139 million.  The odds are overwhelming that about
one out of every 2048² = 4 194 304 pixels will happen to have two
transparent pixels directly on top of one another, and will therefore
be transparent.  If we view a bright backlight through the two sheets,
we can easily detect this pixel.  Each such pixel that we measure
reduces the number of candidate alignments by about a factor of 2048;
any set of more than about four such pixels is adequate to identify
the configuration uniquely, again with overwhelming probability.</p>
<p>All in all, for each configuration, there are about 33 such pixels,
several times more than enough.</p>
<p>These discrete configurations are separated by 21 microns, an inch
divided by 1200.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the more general case, where the displacement happens
in more degrees of freedom and is continuous rather than discrete.
Allow the sheets to rotate in two dimensions and have a perspective
difference between them.  In this case, almost all pixels in one sheet
will overlay parts of four pixels in the other sheet, which increases
the number of pixels with some light leaking through by about a factor
of 4, up to about 133.  It also means that we can measure more than
just whether a given pixel is transparent or not; we can distinguish
degrees of transparency.  How many degrees we can distinguish depends
on the sources of noise, but we can probably reliably measure
something like 64 gray levels for the pixel.  This means we can
measure the displacement of any given overlapping pixel of something
like a 64th of a pixel, which would increase our measurement precision
to under 400 nanometers if geometric optics were the truth.  But
geometric optics breaks down before that point, so we probably can’t
do better than about a micron, at least with visible light.</p>
<p>Note that we’re up to about 2400 bits of signal here (133 * (6 + 12)),
although it’s heavily redundant.  In the worst case, we’re trying to
estimate nine degrees of freedom: the distance from the camera to the
scene, two degrees of freedom of camera angle, and six degrees of
freedom of relative position and orientation of the two transparency
sheets.  We’re hoping to calculate the relative position and
orientation accurate to within about one part in 300 000, which is 18
bits; the other three degrees of freedom might need to be estimated to
a similar relative precision even if we don’t care.  The upshot is
that we need to estimate 162 bits of information from 2400 bits of
data, which seems eminently feasible.</p>
<p>How much camera resolution do we need for the pattern of pinholes we
see to be unique to that configuration?  We might need enough
resolution to be able to usually separate the light from different
pinholes.  This might require something like 256 × 256 pixels on the
sensor plane, so that most of the 133 pinholes are by themselves in a
row and by themselves in a column.  This is a few hundred kilobits of
information.</p>
<p>How can we make it practical to estimate this information, even if it
is in principle contained in the camera image?  In principle, you
could simply measure the distance from the 2¹⁶² or so interestingly
different configurations and pick the one with the lowest error.
Hopefully this is not necessary in practice.  Here are some techniques
that will probably work:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First identify which pixels are bright, estimating the
   pixel-rounded displacements from that, then compare their
   brightnesses to get subpixel data.  For a given camera angle, scene
   distance, and rotation, this cuts the number of configurations down
   to only 139 million.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do the coregistration computation in Fourier-transformed spatial
   frequency space rather than in the spatial domain.  What we’re
   doing in physical space here amounts to multiplying the two
   transparencies pointwise in the spatial domain, which is equivalent
   to convolving their frequency spectra.  If we guess roughly the
   right rotation, maybe we can roughly deconvolve the
   frequency-domain signal of the product with the frequency-domain
   signal of one of the transparencies, giving us an estimate of the
   frequency-domain signal of the other — hopefully including its
   phase shift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of one single-scale pinhole field, we could divide the
   sheets into areas of “pinholes” of different sizes, or merely mix
   different sizes of pinholes together, from the 21-μm single-pixel
   pinholes up to 21-mm finger holes.  Then we can use the much
   smaller number of significantly different configurations of the
   bigger holes to tell us what neighborhood to search in for
   configurations of the smaller holes, in this example through
   perhaps ten power-of-two hole sizes.  There are only about 140
   interestingly different translational configurations of 21-mm
   holes, about 12000 if you include 2D rotation, and half a million
   if you include 3D rotations.  These numbers make exhaustive search
   feasible.  (By necessity the larger holes will need to be
   distributed somewhat more densely, unless you try to recognize the
   patterns of smaller holes visible through them instead of just
   comparing them with each other.)  Larger holes may also make the
   Fourier approach more feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re tracking motion, you can use position estimates from
   previous frames to find which neighborhoods of configurations to
   search in in a new frame.  You can extend this to many simultaneous
   hypotheses using particle filters and the like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rotations and perspective distortion are less important in small
   neighborhoods; if you examine a small neighborhood, you don’t need
   to consider nearly as many rotations.  Like large holes, this might
   benefit from higher density of holes.  Consider a circular
   neighborhood of radius 1150 pixels (about 25 mm), which will
   contain on average about four million pixels and four of these
   coincidental pinholes; you can rotate it by up to about 440
   microradians before the pattern of pinholes changes.  If you were
   to increase the density of pinholes in the original from one per
   2048 to one per 64, then you would have four coincidental pinholes
   every 2048 pixels, contained in a circle of radius about 72 pixels,
   which wouldn’t change constellations until it had been rotated by
   about 2.2 milliradians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you compute the Delaunay triangulation of the bright points, you
   should be able to eliminate the necessity to try many different
   rotations.  Many such tests on clouds of detected features are
   known in the computer vision literature.  You can probably even
   hash some aspects of the feature graph.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The techniques that involve increasing the pinhole density will
decrease the information available per pinhole and probably require
more pixels on the image sensor, but they provide more information
overall (at least until the density of holes goes above, I think,
1/e).</p>

<h2>Sparkly surfaces</h2>
<p>A related approach is to use the reflections from a sparkling surface
illuminated from a single direction for the feedback.  For example, a
piece of sandstone in the sun.  If the light source and camera are
fixed, the pattern of sparkles gives fairly precise information about
the two angles of the surface to the axis bisecting the angle between
the direction to the light and the direction to the camera; the
rotation of the pattern on the focal plane gives fairly precise
information about the rotation of the surface <em>around</em> that axis; the
position of the pattern gives fairly precise information about the
translation of the surface perpendicular to that axis; and the scale
of the pattern gives very crude information about the translation of
the surface <em>along</em> that axis.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to start by calibrating the system with a massive
database of sparkle patterns from that surface from many different
angles.</p>
<p>The system as described can be improved in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by using more than one light, ideally in separate frames of video,
  in order to provide redundant information and in particular to
  triangulate to get more precision in the imprecise dimension;</li>
<li>by making the background of the sparkles as dark as possible;</li>
<li>by making the bright facets themselves slightly concave, both so
  that they generate a brighter sparkle and so that it is visible over
  a smaller part of the surface’s rotation;</li>
<li>by making <em>some</em> facets sufficiently convex that they can be used to
  get an approximate angle fairly quickly, thus speeding the search
  for the precise position;</li>
<li>by making the sparkles very sparse, so that there are always a few
  visible, but only a few;</li>
<li>by defocusing the camera to optically convolve the sparkle pattern
  with a sharp-edged bokeh, permitting the use of many pixels along
  the border of the bokeh from a given sparkle to find its position on
  the focal plane to much better than a single pixel of precision, a
  feat which is not possible if the sparkle is perfectly focused and
  thus just saturating the fuck out of a single focal-plane pixel;</li>
<li>by (as described above) placing a moiré-generating screen between
  the camera and the sparkling surface, close to the sparkling
  surface, in order to distinguish displacements of a screen thread or
  so, which may be much less than a pixel;</li>
<li>by using a combination of large facets for better angular resolution
  with small facets for better spatial resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Riding the Sarmiento train to Once, when it was stuck in a station for
a while with the doors open, I observed that moving my head by two
fingerswidths (≈20 mm) caused a certain sparkle in the floor to
appear; moving it two fingerswidths further caused it to disappear.
The sparkle on the floor was about 3 m away from my head, suggesting
an angular resolution of some 6 milliradians from simply thresholding
that single sparkle; presumably you could get down to 1 mrad by
comparing the relative brightnesses of several.</p>
<p>The sharp boundary of the sun’s disc (which should be about 9.3
milliradians across, with an edge of 0.5 milliradians or less) was not
evident, suggesting that the sparkle (or something, maybe some clouds)
was introducing several milliradians of divergence.</p>
<p>Achieving a divergence of 0.5 milliradians (1.7 minutes of arc) at a
wavelength of 400 nm from a blue LED requires a beam waist of at least
about 0.4 mm, so if you want that much angular resolution, your facets
need to be at least that big.  (And your light source needs to, if not
subtend that little of the field of view of the sparkly surface, at
least have significant energy in spatial frequencies that high — for
example, the sun’s sharp boundary.  A fuzzy Gaussian light source is
kind of the worst case for a light source of a given size, although of
course uniform ambient illumination is the worst case.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
