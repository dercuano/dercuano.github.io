(2 minutes)</div><p>Suppose you want to implement a fast, secure publish-subscribe
(“pub-sub”)
service.  What if you package your message transformation and
filtering code into individual processes that run and produce a
result?</p>
<p>The idea is that Turing-complete rules provided by the sender, the
receiver, and possibly intermediate routing entities run in
very-short-lived ephemeral processes which have relevant information
mapped into their memory space.  Even on Linux, it’s possible to spawn
off 7000 processes per second; we should be able to do better with a
custom kernel, and for example <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime">Fastly's Lucet WebAssembly
runtime</a>
"can instantiate WebAssembly modules in under 50 microseconds", thus
potentially permitting the creation of some 20,000 "processes" per
second per core.  Processes that exceed their CPU allocation are
ruthlessly killed.</p>
<p>Processes running sender-supplied code can be run with access to
information about potential recipients to prevent insensitive
recipients from seeing sensitive information, and then they can be
killed to prevent them leaking information about the potential
recipients either to the sender or to other recipients.  Processes
running receiver-supplied code can inspect relevant aspects of the
message to decide whether or not to pass the message along — either
whole or in some summarized form.</p>
<p>If access to the message is provided not via memory-mapping but via
some kind of recordable API, a recipient-provided Turing-complete
selection function that is careful not to inspect more message fields
than needed can implicitly produce a memoized filter rule in a
supervisory process.  For example, if the filter function inspects a
“newsgroup” field, finds that its value is “alt.sex”, and then rejects
the message without inspecting further fields, then the supervisory
process can memoize a filter rule: <code>[{"newsgroup": "alt.sex"},
"reject"]</code>.  Perhaps it can construct a trie on known values of
“newsgroup” and only actually invoke filter functions whose results
are not already recorded in the trie — perhaps they inspected an
additional field, for example, or perhaps there are values of
“newsgroup” that have not previously been seen.</p>
<p>This is very similar to how transactional memory observes the reads
being executed by the code in a transaction in order to be able to
safely detect update conflicts.</p>
<p>I think this is a particular application of Umut Acar’s
“self-adjusting computation”.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
