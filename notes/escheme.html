<h1>Eur-Scheme</h1><div class="metadata">Kragen Javier Sitaker, 2007 to 2009
(13 minutes)</div>
<p>So I was thinking about how to simplify <a href="http://pobox.com/~kragen/sw/urscheme/" title="The Ur-Scheme compiler">Ur-Scheme</a> further.
Ur-Scheme is about 1600 lines of code so far.  Something like half or
a third of that is assembly code, represented in Scheme, mostly
implementing the basic types (strings, conses, closures, heap
variables, symbols, booleans, characters, nil, fixnums) and the basic
control structures (procedure call and return, including tail-call
elimination, closure creation, conditionals, sequences).  The
primitives thus defined total about 1100 lines of assembly-language
output, so they're probably somewhere around 1000 instructions.  (But
it doesn't have a garbage collector yet!)</p>
<p>Having these things implemented in assembly definitely helps it reach
the reasonable performance level that it does.  But it would be nice
to have a system that was a lot simpler and more portable, even if it
was slower.</p>
<h2>eForth's approach</h2>
<p>The eForth Model 1.0 was a Forth system written to be maximally
portable; the x86 version apparently contains 171 machine-code
instructions in about 28 primitives, and everything else is built up
on top of that in interpreted Forth words.  The primitives were
something like the following set:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lit</code> push a literal</li>
<li><code>exit</code> return from an interpreted subroutine</li>
<li><code>execute</code> call a subroutine whose value is on the stack</li>
<li><code>(if)</code> branch if top of stack is 0</li>
<li><code>(else)</code> branch unconditionally</li>
<li><code>next</code> update loop counter and possibly branch</li>
<li><code>!</code>, <code>@</code> store and fetch a cell in memory</li>
<li><code>c!</code>, <code>c@</code> store and fetch a byte in memory</li>
<li><code>rp@</code>, <code>rp!</code>, <code>sp@</code>, <code>sp!</code> get and set the return and operand stack
  pointers (for e.g. exception handling)</li>
<li><code>r&gt;</code> pop the return stack onto the data stack</li>
<li><code>&gt;r</code> push the return stack onto the data stack</li>
<li><code>drop</code> discard an item on the operand stack</li>
<li><code>dup</code>, <code>over</code> copy the top or second stack items onto the top of
  stack</li>
<li><code>swap</code> exchange the top two stack items</li>
<li><code>0&lt;</code> test whether the top item is zero</li>
<li><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code> bitwise operators</li>
<li><code>!io</code> I forget what this does</li>
<li><code>?rx</code> return true if there's input waiting</li>
<li>and there were primitives to send and receive a byte over a serial line.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't remember how eForth accomplished rightward bit shifts
(e.g. for division), and I don't have it handy at the moment.</p>
<h2>The Eur-Scheme Ideal</h2>
<p>Could we build a Scheme with a similar structure &mdash; as little as
possible in assembly code?  Would it be simpler?</p>
<p>Ideally we'd be able to implement not only the normal Scheme types,
but also as much as possible of the run-time system, in Scheme, on top
of a minimal set of machine-code primitives.  That would mean heap
allocation, garbage collection, some parts of closure handling,
variadic function calls, and all the types mentioned above; the basic
system would only have to support (non-closure) function call and
return, some conditional (I'm using <code>%ifeq</code>), and <code>set!</code>; and
primitives for accessing memory.</p>
<h2>Two Approaches To <code>cons</code></h2>
<p>The implementation of <code>quote</code> in a compiler is kind of annoying; it's
straightforward in an interpreter or a load-and-go compiler, but in a
compiler that might run in a different interpreter, and that generates
an output file rather than compiling things into memory, its
representations of data have to be compatible with those produced by
the definition used at run-time, regardless of whether that run-time
definition is in Scheme, C, assembly, or something else.</p>
<p>Ur-Scheme's <code>pair</code> structure, created by <code>cons</code>, consists of three
machine words in order: the magic number <code>0x2ce11ed</code> to identify it as
a cons, the car, and the cdr.</p>
<p>Here are the two definitions of <code>cons</code> from Ur-Scheme, the run-time
definition and the compile-time definition used by <code>quote</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">We define a label here before the procedure prologue so that other
</span><span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">asm routines can call cons
</span>(add-to-header (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> () (text) (label <span class="string">"cons"</span>)))
(define-global-procedure 'cons 2
  (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> ()
    (emit-malloc-n 12)
    (mov (const cons-magic) (indirect tos))
    (mov tos ebx)
    (get-procedure-arg 0)
    (mov tos (offset ebx 4))
    (pop)
    (get-procedure-arg 1)
    (mov tos (offset ebx 8))
    (pop)))
<span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">Compile a quoted cons cell.
</span>(<span class="keyword">define</span> (<span class="function-name">compile-cons</span> car-contents cdr-contents labelname)
  (rodatum labelname)
  (compile-word cons-magic)
  (compile-word car-contents)
  (compile-word cdr-contents)
  (text))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been considering a slight variation in which assembly-emitting
routines return the location in which their result was placed.  That
would shorten the run-time code for <code>cons</code> above to the following
slight variation; I'm not sure if this is clearer or not, but it's
certainly briefer, at 6 lines of body instead of 9.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
(define-global-procedure 'cons 2
  (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> ()
    (mov (const cons-magic) (indirect (emit-malloc-n 12)))
    (mov tos ebx)
    (mov (get-procedure-arg 0) (offset ebx 4))
    (pop)
    (mov (get-procedure-arg 1) (offset ebx 8))
    (pop)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be ideal if the two could be generated from a single
structure specification, but at present there are only three in-memory
types that can be generated at compile-time: pairs, strings (which are
variable-sized and mostly consist of bytes), and symbols (which point
to strings).  So it's not clear that such a struct facility would be a
net win for simplicity.</p>
<h2>Primitives for Accessing Memory: The Eur-Scheme Approach</h2>
<p>So the garbage collector, the heap allocator, and the stuff out of
which <code>pair</code>s and <code>string</code>s and so on are constructed need to be able
to access raw memory.  And it's important that the garbage collector
and the heap allocator not accidentally call the heap allocator
&mdash; you could easily get an infinite recursive loop; so their
interface to raw memory shouldn't require heap-allocation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to do this would be to support basically a subset
of C: allow routines to declare local variables that are just machine
words, which can be used as pointers, are allocated on the stack or in
machine registers, and are somehow ignored by the garbage collector
(because they aren't necessarily Scheme values or pointers to Scheme
heap objects).</p>
<p>But I'm going to talk about another approach, which I think will
probably be simpler.  You have a <code>pointer</code> data type, like the
<code>string</code> and <code>pair</code> data types of normal Scheme, and an explicit stack
to save and restore <code>pointer</code>s on; and a set of <code>pointer</code>s that exist
from the time the program starts, and are therefore not
heap-allocated.  In order to </p>
<p>For concreteness, there could be eight callee-saves pointers, called
<code>%g0</code>, <code>%g1</code>, <code>%g2</code>, <code>%g3</code>, <code>%g4</code>, <code>%g5</code>, <code>%g6</code>, and <code>%g7</code>, and eight
caller-saves pointers, called <code>%c0</code>, <code>%c1</code>, <code>%c2</code>, <code>%c3</code>, <code>%c4</code>,
<code>%c5</code>, <code>%c6</code>, and <code>%c7</code>.  There might be other <code>pointer</code>s around.  For
example, there might be some <code>pointer</code> constants created by the
compiler, or <code>pointer</code> variables allocated on the heap by routines
that aren't part of the garbage collector or memory allocator.</p>
<p>Then we need only a set of primitives for accessing them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(*put! foo %p0)</code> store the value of a Scheme expression in <code>%p0</code>
  and returns <code>%p0</code>.</li>
<li><code>(*get %p0)</code> returns the value stored in <code>%p0</code> as a Scheme
  expression value.  If the value is not, in fact, a valid Scheme
  object, this is likely to crash the program.</li>
<li><code>(*load! %p0 %p1)</code> fetch the value <code>%p0</code> points to in memory, stores
  it in <code>%p1</code>, and returns <code>%p1</code>.</li>
<li><code>(*store! %p0 %p1)</code> stores the value in <code>%p0</code> into the place in
  memory pointed to by <code>%p1</code>, and returns <code>()</code>.</li>
<li><code>(*load-byte! %p0 %p1)</code> and <code>(*store-byte! %p0 %p1)</code> are analogous,
  but only load or store the single low-order byte.</li>
<li><code>(*push! %p0)</code> and <code>(*pop! %p0)</code> save and restore <code>pointer</code> values
  from a special <code>pointer</code> stack, which surely has some maximum size,
  but in any case does not allocate memory from the heap.</li>
<li><code>(*get-sp! %p0)</code> and <code>(*get-fp! %p0)</code> get the machine-level stack
  pointer and frame pointer registers of the caller and store it into
  <code>%p0</code>, to support stack introspection (e.g. garbage collector
  tracing or backtrace printing.).  They return <code>%p0</code>.</li>
<li>Optionally, <code>(*set-sp! %p0)</code> and <code>(*set-fp! %p0)</code> set those machine
  registers, and <code>(*get-psp! %p0)</code> and <code>(*set-psp! %p0)</code> get and set
  the pointer stack pointer.  These primitives could be useful for
  exception handling, but isn't necessary for the applications I've
  discussed so far.</li>
<li><code>(*add! %p0 12 %p1)</code> does pointer arithmetic, storing the contents
  of <code>%p0</code>, plus <code>12</code>, into <code>%p1</code>, and returns <code>%p1</code>.</li>
<li><code>(*add! %p0 %p2 %p1)</code> does the same thing, but uses the contents of
  <code>%p2</code>.</li>
<li><code>*and!</code>, <code>*or!</code>, and <code>*xor!</code> are analogous to <code>*add!</code>.</li>
<li><code>(*unsigned-&lt;? %p0 %p1)</code> returns a Scheme true or false value: true
  if the contents of <code>%p0</code>, interpreted as an unsigned number,
  are less than those of <code>%p1</code>, and false otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>These 20 or so primitives are more or less sufficient for implementing
things like the garbage collector and high-level data structures.
None of them are particularly complicated; here's a possible
implementation of the body of <code>*load!</code>:</p>
<blockquote>

        <span class="keyword">mov</span> (<span class="variable-name">%ebp</span>), <span class="variable-name">%eax</span>        <span class="comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="comment">fetch argument zero, %p0 (src)

</span></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Those seven instructions are wrapped inside seven more instructions
for procedure prologue and epilogue.  This suggests that the total
number of assembly instructions that you <em>need to write</em> to implement
these primitives on a new CPU is somewhere around 7 * 20 = 140, plus
the basic conditional, procedure call and return, and variable access.
So you could probably port such a Scheme to a new CPU architecture
with 300-400 lines of code or so, around twice the amount needed to
port the eForth Model 1.0.</p>
<p>Of those 150-200 instructions that you need to write, some are in
procedure prologues and epilogues that get duplicated 20 times for
those 20 or so primitives.  So you might end up with something like
400-500 lines of assembly output for the primitives.</p>
<h2>Two More Approaches to <code>cons</code></h2>
<p>Again, the nested-assembly version of <code>cons</code> looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
(define-global-procedure 'cons 2
  (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> ()
    (mov (const cons-magic) (indirect (emit-malloc-n 12)))
    (mov tos ebx)
    (mov (get-procedure-arg 0) (offset ebx 4))
    (pop)
    (mov (get-procedure-arg 1) (offset ebx 8))
    (pop)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The "subset of C" approach might look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
(<span class="keyword">define</span> (<span class="function-name">cons</span> car cdr)
  (let-pointer ((rv (malloc-n 12)))
    (pointer-write (indirect rv) cons-magic)
    (pointer-write (offset rv 4) (pointer-val car))
    (pointer-write (offset rv 8) (pointer-val cdr))
    rv))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The Eur-Scheme approach might look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
(<span class="keyword">define</span> (<span class="function-name">cons</span> car cdr)
  (*store! cons-magic (malloc-n 12 %c0)) <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">cons-magic is a pointer constant
</span>  (*store! (*put! car %c1) (*add! %c0 4 %c2))
  (*store! (*put! cdr %c1) (*add! %c0 8 %c2))
  (*get c0))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><code>cons</code> doesn't have to save and restore the values of those <code>pointer</code>s
because they're all caller-saves, and <code>cons</code> isn't calling anything
else that might use them for its own purposes.</p>
<p>I think that's a substantial improvement in both readability and
simplicity over the current assembly version, and it's not obviously
worse than the subset-of-C version.  This example leads me to suspect
that defining routines in this fashion, rather than in assembly, would
make for a considerably more concise and comprehensible Scheme system
than Ur-Scheme.</p>
