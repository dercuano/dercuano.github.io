(7 minutes)</div><p>I want to add backlinks to Dercuano articles.</p>
<h2>Backlinks</h2>
<p>Backlinks are the Wiki feature which shows you all the pages that link
to a page; they make links in some sense bidirectional, and they
allowed us to categorize pages on Wiki years before Wikipedia — you
would just create a page called CategoryWhatever and then link to it
from whatever pages you thought should belong to it, and look at its
backlinks page.</p>
<p>I think having backlinks will improve Dercuano’s navigability
dramatically.</p>
<h2>Desired implementation in Dercuano</h2>
<p>In Dercuano I’d like to display the backlinks on the same page as the
rest of the article, maybe at the end, and ideally with a bit of
context.  This is especially helpful when I have a later note that
essentially obsoletes an earlier one.</p>
<h2>Implementation techniques</h2>
<p>Dercuano goes to some amount of trouble to avoid rerendering notes
unnecessarily, because rerendering all the notes takes 28 seconds on
my laptop, while just regenerating the categories and the index page
takes only 6.3 seconds.  A more detailed timing breakdown (as of
dercuano-20190522):</p>
<pre><code>|                                        |   sec |
| rerendering all the notes              |    28 |
| just regenerating categories and index |   6.3 |
| instantiating Bundle and all Notes     |   0.5 |
| reading `triples`                      | 0.065 |
| bundle.generate_index()                |   2.0 |
| bundle.generate_categories()           |   2.9 |
</code></pre>
<p>Actually about a quarter of this time to generate categories and
indices is finding note titles, and another 10% is finding the notes
in a category; most of the rest is generating HTML, though some of it
is querying the unnecessarily inefficient triple store, which is also
a factor in the note titles being slow.  But 77% of the execution time
is rendering notes, which is mostly a matter of running Markdown,
though it actually spends about 25% of its time finding the notes in a
category too.</p>
<p>So Dercuano is a lot more usable when it doesn’t rerender notes when
it doesn’t have to, although it produces incorrect results when it
fails to rerender notes whose titles and categories have changed.  The
trouble is, the point at which we learn about the backlinks is when we
render the bodies of the notes.  (At present, repl() on line 469
inside <code>replace_links</code> is getting called 3095 times, some of which it
finds a backlink.)</p>
<p>One of the things I’d like to do is do the actual rendering in
subprocesses, so that I can run four or so of them; ideally, this
should speed up the 22 seconds of rendering to 5.5 seconds, although
lazy memoization may result in some duplication of work between the
subprocesses.</p>
<p>Without caching, the minimal-work way of handling the
unknown-backlinks problem would be to do it in two phases: one phase
where we render all the bodies, and a second phase where we render all
the backlinks.  However, this adds complication if we want to farm the
rendering out to subprocesses, since they would then need to deliver
both the backlinks and the bodies back to the main process, probably
via the firesystem.</p>
<p>A different approach would be to store the relevant backlinks in the
filesystem somehow, in the output directory probably, and rerender the
page when its backlinks change.  Most of the time, they wouldn’t
change even when some other note that links to it changes, but when
they do, this could require you to render the same note twice in the
same run.  In particular this results in rendering nearly all the
notes twice when starting from a missing output directory, since at
first each note is rendered with no backlinks, and then later it will
be rendered with backlinks.</p>
<p>…this suggests I should optimize the triple store a bit and profile my
execution times again.  So I did.  Upon adding code to index the
triple store on startup, the Bundle instantiation time ballooned from
0.50 s to 0.55 s; upon using it, the build-from-scratch time went down
from 28 s to 18 s, and the just-rebuild-index-and-categories time went
from 6.3 s to 2.5 s.  Now the top time consumers are all Markdown
rendering functions, except for 650 ms waiting for tar to finish.</p>
<p>This in some sense makes the case for avoiding and parallelizing
Markdown rerendering more urgent than before: previously Markdown took
75% of the runtime, and now it takes 85%.</p>
<p>So, my thought is to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>At program startup, read all the backlinks.</li>
<li>For each note:<ol>
<li>Generate a glob of metadata for a note from the triple store
   (for example, the titles and note counts of categories) and the
   backlinks.</li>
<li>Compare the glob of metadata to the previous glob of metadata for
   that note, stored on disk.  If it’s the same and the note source
   file hasn’t changed, continue to the next note.</li>
<li>Render the note and generate backlinks.</li>
<li>Store the glob of metadata and the backlinks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Update the backlinks store and do #2 a second time.  A second time
   should be sufficient to reach a fixed point.  This should be done
   automatically, rather than requiring the user to do it as
   L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X does.</li>
</ol>
<p>This requires separate stores for the glob of inputs for a note and
the glob of outputs (including backlinks).  I’m thinking this can be
in places like .meta/cheap-frequency-detection.inputs and
.meta/cheap-frequency-detection.outputs for the note
notes/cheap-frequency-detection.html.</p>
<p>The code path actually needs to be a little bit more complicated,
because the set of other notes’ titles that the note HTML depends on
is a function of the note source file’s contents, and finding out what
that set is presently would require us to rerender the Markdown, which
is what we’re trying to avoid.  But we don’t actually need to go that
far — if the source file has changed, we need to rerender it anyway.</p>
<p>We could imagine storing the titles of notes parsed from the HTML in
the same store as the backlinks (thus the filename .output rather than
.backlinks) in order to avoid opening and parsing the same files
multiple times.</p>
