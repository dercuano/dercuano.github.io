(4 minutes)</div><p>Suppose we wanted to design a simple unidirectional byte-stream
protocol for efficiently drawing pixel graphics on a relatively
unadorned framebuffer — maybe in an alternate history world where
textual communications protocols evolved from gradual digitalization
of TV rather than gradual multimediation of text.</p>
<p>For additional enjoyment, we could imagine that this happened in a
world where Japan wasn’t devastated by WWII, and so the raster lines
run from top to bottom, then right to left, with both coordinates
running in the opposite direction from the Cartesian convention.</p>
<p>The GIF89a extensions for animation are a somewhat promising
direction: they allow you to update part of the display after a time
delay.  Because GIF is LZW-compressed, you get a fair bit of
compression and a little bit of abstraction for a tiny amount of
hardware; it takes very few bytes to redraw something you already
drew.</p>
<p>Suppose we go a bit further in that direction.  We have, say, a 16-bit
color framebuffer, and normally we just stream 16-bit pixels into it
in raster order.  If we have a 128×128 framebuffer, which is an
acceptable size, we have 16384 pixels, 32768 bytes of data; if we want
to be able to repaint that completely 5 times per second, we need
163 840 bytes per second, which is 655 360 bits per second.  This is
a fairly easy data rate at the electronic level.</p>
<p>For faster updates, we can add escape sequences!  In particular, let’s
consider four additions:</p>
<p>window(x, y, width, height): subsequent data updates the specified
area of the framebuffer.  This allows you to update part of the
display more frequently, while updating other parts less frequently.</p>
<p>scroll(x, y): the next screen repaint starts from position (x, y) in
the framebuffer, with wraparound for subsequent rasters if it runs off
the edge of the framebuffer.</p>
<p>font(x, y, tilewidth, tileheight): subsequent data bytes are
interpreted as byte indices into a 16×16 “font” located at (x, y) in
the framebuffer, with tiles of tilewidth×tileheight.  So, for each
data byte, the current position is incremented by tileheight or, if it
has exceeded the current window, set back to the top of the window and
incremented by tilewidth.</p>
<p>nofont(): subsequent data bytes are again interpreted as raw pixel
data.</p>
<p>You could imagine a couple of other escape sequences to support sprite
compositing.</p>
<p>Now let’s suppose that the actual framebuffer is not 128×128 but
256×256, but only 128×128 of it is normally visible; we can assign
some fraction of it to ROM fonts, such as half.  We can still encode
all our pixel coordinates as bytes, but now we can use the scroll()
sequence both for smooth pixel scrolling and for double-buffering.</p>
<p>This requires 128×256×2 = 65536 bytes of framebuffer.  In our
universe, the CGA shipped in 1981 with 640×200 bits = 128000 bits =
16000 bytes of framebuffer.  So building a “terminal” to interpret
such a command set only became practical two Moore’s Law iterations
later, in 1984, about eight years after the US$1195 ADM-3A started
supporting cursor control in 1976, and 20 years after ASCII printing
terminals were already in widespread use as computer output devices.
So, as an alternate history encoding, this fails.</p>
<p>128×128 is enough space to display 32 columns of 21 characters each in
6×4 size, but I’m not sure you can get readable katakana at that size.
(Roman letters are already a bit of a stretch.)  6×6 squares, 21
columns of 21 characters, should be easy.</p>
