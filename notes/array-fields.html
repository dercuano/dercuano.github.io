(2 minutes)</div><p>If you have some underlying field like GF(2) you might think you could
derive an infinite variety of other fields from it by way of taking
arrays of some finite size which operate elementwise.</p>
<p>For example, GF(2) is just bits, using AND as multiplication and XOR
as addition; considering the field axioms, these are associative,
commutative, have identity, distribute (a &amp; (b ^ c) = (a &amp; b) ^ (a &amp;
c)) and have inverses (each element is its own inverse, trivially so
in the case of AND: 1 &amp; 1 = 1), so that’s a finite field.  You might
think that you could extend this elementwise to “bitvectors” (not in
the sense of a vector space, just in the sense of arrays of bits) but
this fails when we get to the inverse: AND with a “bitvector”
containing zeroes is information-destroying, so there can be no
inverse.  In the single-bit case, we get to escape by pleading
division by zero, but not in the multibit case.</p>
<p>So “bitvectors” of some size form a commutative ring with unity, but
not a field.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a field of size 2⁸, though.  It’s GF(256), which is not
just ℤ/256ℤ, arithmetic modulo 256, as you might think — that’s,
again, just a commutative ring with unity, since there are plenty of
pairs of numbers that multiply to zero, like 2·128, so not every
member has a multiplicative inverse.  No, in some sense it <em>is</em> a
vector of 8 bits, but I don’t understand the construction of the
operations; it’s some kind of construction with monic irreducible
polynomials.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/math.html">Math</a> (78 notes)
