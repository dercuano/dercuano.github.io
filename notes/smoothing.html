(11 minutes)</div><p>So when you estimate the probability of an event from a sample, you
have to “smooth”, which is to say that you have to increase your
estimate of the probability a little bit so that it is never zero,
since concluding that the probability of any event is zero based only
on a sample is clearly wrong.  The most common way is to add 1 to both
the sample size and the number of observed events, and I think that
this is in fact an unbiased estimator.</p>
<p>But if you have more information, maybe you can do better.  In
particular, I was thinking about estimating the statistical likelihood
of a particular word being the next word in a sentence.  This is
useful, for example, for travesty generators like <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc/shaney.html" title="I Spent an Interesting Evening Recently with a Grain of Salt, by Penn Jillette">Mark V. Shaney</a>.</p>
<h2>Zeroth-Order Markov Models</h2>
<p>You can use a “zeroth-order [Markov model][]”, and just figure that
the probability that the next word is, say, “figure” is the
probability of “figure” being any particular word --- regardless of
context.  That is, it’s the number of occurrences of “figure” in your
training corpus (plus one), divided by the total number of words in
your training corpus (plus one).</p>
<p>That gives you some information, for sure.  But if you use that model
to generate text, it doesn’t look much like real text.</p>
<h2>First-Order Markov Models</h2>
<p>If you use a first-order Markov model, you use the previous word,
say, “just”.  And you look for the number of occurrences of “just
figure” in your corpus (plus one) and divide that by the number of
occurrences of “just” (followed by any word) (plus one) in the
training corpus.  And you use that for your estimate.</p>
<p>Text generated from a first-order Markov model tends to look like
relatively real text.  If you don’t smooth the probabilities, then you
only ever get word pairs that occurred in the real text, so the text
minimally conforms to a [regular-language][] approximation of the
[grammar][] that generated your corpus, and if the model is
[ergodic][], the frequencies of the words will additionally be about
right.  (See also the Jargon File entry on <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/Dissociated-Press.html">Dissociated Press</a>.)</p>
<h2>Second-Order Markov Models</h2>
<p>You can use a second-order Markov model and look at the two words, say
“and just”, and then divide the number of occurrences of “and just
figure” (plus one) by the number of occurrences of “and just *” (plus
one) in the corpus.  This generates even more realistic text, because
although it’s still using a regular-language approximation, the
[DFA][] (a Markov model is a DFA augmented with transition
probabilities) can now have N² states instead of N states, where N is
the number of distinct words in the corpus.  So it can be a better
approximation.</p>
<p>However, now you run into a problem.  The number of states in a
second-order Markov model can be greater than the number of words in
your text.  For example, before I wrote this sentence, this note
contained 475 words, of which 162 were unique.  That means that a
second-order Markov model built from its vocabulary would contain
26244 states, only 474 of which, at most, could contain any sample
information!</p>
<p>So if you smooth in the way I suggested above, by adding one to the
counts of both “and just figure” and “and just *”, you probably wind
up with a gross overestimate of the probability of “and just 26244”
and a gross underestimate of the probability of “and just the”, and so
in fact the output can look less realistic than the output from a
“zeroth-order Markov model”.  The usual way to deal with this in
Dissociated Press is to not smooth at all; most of the transitions
have zero probability.  Unfortunately this often results in repeating
long passages from the training corpus, especially once you go to
third- and higher-order Markov models.</p>
<p>Essentially, such higher-order models are almost inevitably
[overfitted][] --- they are so flexible that they end up learning the
detailed structure of their training set, and if you try to compensate
by smoothing, they don’t learn anything.</p>
<h2>How to Fix the Problem</h2>
<p>However, it seems to me that you could do the smoothing in a more
effective way, by using first-order and “zeroth-order” Markov models
from the same training corpus to fill the gap.</p>
<p>Effectively, when you’re spewing out randomly generated text, the
smoothing amounts to adding one extra occurrence of, say, “and just”.
The standard way of smoothing amounts to assuming that all words that
haven’t been seen after “and just” are equally likely.</p>
<p>If instead you use your first-order Markov model to decide on that
distribution --- in this case, the smoothed probability distribution
of words following “just” --- you’ll do much better.</p>
<p>And, of course, you can smooth the first-order Markov model using the
observed word frequencies (the “zeroth-order model”), instead of
assuming that all words in the vocabulary are equally likely.</p>
<p>When you’re generating random text, there’s no obvious way to smooth
the zeroth-order Markov model; you can’t straightforwardly generate an
arbitrary word you’ve never seen before.  But in some other
applications of Markov models, such as data compression, OCR, speech
recognition, and entropy estimation, you only have to deal with things
that are actually found in the input text.</p>
<p>Note that in the case that the word pair in the current state does not
occur in the training set, this reduces to a first-order Markov model.
This suggests that it is the Right Thing.</p>
<h2>Data Structures</h2>
<p>If you want to implement this algorithm, you can use a [suffix
array][] or [suffix tree][] on the training set.  This allows you to
efficiently answer questions like “how many times does ‘model, and
just’ occur in the input, and what is the distribution of what occurs
next?” without storing an excessive amount of data.  Suffix trees take
up an awful lot of space, but Udi Manber and XXX Myers discovered a
<a href="http://webglimpse.net/pubs/suffix.pdf">reasonably efficient algorithm</a>
for constructing suffix arrays in 1989-1991
(or was it Manber and Wu in the 1990s?), 
and it’s used as the basis for the [Glimpse][] search
engine.  The suffix array merely needs space for one pointer per
<a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fwtompa/.papers/oed-91-01.ps" title="Lexicographical Indices for Text, by Gonnet, Baeza-Yates, and Snider, 1991">index point</a> in the original text.</p>
<p>If you want to know
what words occurred 
somewhere preceding a given word or phrase
you really want a “prefix tree”,
which is a suffix tree
built on a reversed version of the input corpus.
...</p>
<h2>Other Applications</h2>
<p>It occurred to me that if you wanted to know what words to boldface in
an English text, you might have some success highlighting the
lowest-probability words.  This could also be useful in source code
highlighting: figuring out which tokens are most informative and which
are just noise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/Dissociated-Press.html">Dissociated Press</a> correctly describes Markov-chain random text generation, but incorrectly claims that Emacs’s “dissociated press” is an example thereof.  According to the Emacs manual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dissociated Press produces results fairly like those of a Markov
chain based on a frequency table constructed from the sample text.
It is, however, an independent, ignoriginal invention.  Dissociated
Press techniquitously copies several consecutive characters from the
sample between random choices, whereas a Markov chain would choose
randomly for each word or character.  This makes for more plausible
sounding results, and runs faster.</p>
<p>It is a mustatement that too much use of Dissociated Press can be a
developediment to your real work, sometimes to the point of
outragedy. And keep dissociwords out of your documentation, if you
want it to be well userenced and properbose.  Have fun.  Your
buggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>The idea of an <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fwtompa/.papers/oed-91-01.ps" title="Lexicographical Indices for Text, by Gonnet, Baeza-Yates, and Snider, 1991">index point</a> is explained in Gonnet, Baeza-Yates, and
Snider’s 1991 paper, “Lexicographical Indices for Text: Inverted
Indices vs. PAT trees”.  They had been working on putting the Oxford
English Dictionary on CD-ROM, and so they’d done a bunch of work on
full-text indexing.  Gonnet was at ETH at the time, and Baeza-Yates
was already at the Universidad de Chile.  The paper is mostly devoted
to advocacy of suffix arrays (called PAT arrays in the article) rather
than inverted indices.  They explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An index point is the beginning of a word or a piece of text which
is indexable.  Usually such points are preceded by space...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a little bit puzzled about this paper; it says the PAT tree data
structure “was originally described by Gonnet in the paper
‘Unstructured Data Bases’ [Gon83]”.  But the PAT tree is “a Patricia
tree constructed over all the possible sistrings [suffixes] of a
text,” citing Donald R. Morrison’s 1968 CACM paper on <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/tildeAlgDS/Tree/PATRICIA/" title="Lloyd Allison’s page on PATRICIA at Monash">PATRICIA</a>,
which I believe describes constructing PATRICIA trees over all the
possible suffixes of a text.  But I don’t have the paper handy to
check.</p>
<p>Tim Bray, who also worked on the OED project, recently wrote a series
of articles about the technical aspects of full-text indexing.  He
also worked for some years at a startup called Open Text whose main
product used suffix arrays for its searching.  His analysis of <a href="???">why
suffix arrays are not widely used today</a> is very interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting" title="Wikipedia article on overfitting">Overfitting</a> is a problem with statistical models generally.
Sometimes with neural networks and other machine-learning systems,
it’s called “overtraining”.</p>

<p>Perry Lorier tells me that this is how the PPM* algorithm models;
IIRC that’s what’s used in the champion PAQ family of compressors.  I
should look into it.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (123 notes)
