(9 minutes)</div><p>I was reading Raph Levien’s notes on “rope science” in his “xi”
editor.  He’s talking a lot about monoid cached trees for applications
like maximum line width computation, height computation, parenthesis
matching, detection, and word wrapping; the objectives are to enable
these computations to be done in parallel (across multiple cores),
incrementally, and lazily.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that most of these are kind of special cases of a
generalized DFA monoid, and using the standard parallel prefix-sum
algorithm on the DFA monoid might provide a more convenient way to
express these computations.</p>
<p>Consider this simple example of a comment-tagging NFA, in Perl regexp
syntax extended with <code>@x</code> to tag the just-matched character with <code>x</code>,
using <code>N</code> for non-comment and <code>C</code> for comment:</p>
<pre><code>([^#]@N|#@C([^\n]@C)*(\Z|\n@N))*
</code></pre>
<p>This works out to a fully deterministic regexp, in the sense that you
never have more than one state live after a given character.  If we
unpack it from the regexp syntax into traditional programming outline
syntax, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>repeat:                     # 1
    either:
        match [^#]
        tag N
    or:
        match "#"
        tag C
        repeat:             # 2
            match [^\n]
            tag C
        either:
            match EOF
        or:
            match "\n"
            tag N
</code></pre>
<p>Despite being 15 lines of code, and not counting the final state, this
FSM only has two states, marked above with the comments “# 1” and
“# 2”. The state diagram looks like this (pipe to <code>dot -Tx11</code> from the
graphviz package to see):</p>
<pre><code>digraph nc {
    rankdir=LR;
    LR_1 [ shape=circle, label="1" ]; LR_2 [ shape=circle, label="2" ];
    EOF [ shape=doublecircle, label="" ];

    LR_1 -&gt; LR_1 [ label="[^#]\nN" ];   LR_1 -&gt; LR_2 [ label="#\nC" ];
    LR_2 -&gt; LR_2 [ label="[^\\n]\nC" ]; LR_2 -&gt; LR_1 [ label="\\n\nN" ];
    { LR_1 LR_2 } -&gt; EOF [ label="EOF" ];
}
</code></pre>
<p>XXX why is state 2’s EOF transition sort of explicit while state 1’s
isn’t?</p>
<p>Now, obviously, you can run this on a text sequentially, starting from
a known initial state, tagging each of the characters with either N or
C as you go.  At any given point in the text, your state is either 1
or 2.</p>
<p>However, you can <em>also</em> run it from an <em>unknown</em> initial state.  In
this case, your state at any given point in the text is a <em>function</em>
from the initial state to the current state.  Initially this function
is { 1: 1, 2: 2 }.  And as you go, you tag each character, not with N
or C, but with a <em>function</em> from the initial state to the tag.  For
example, if the first character is “q”, then you tag it with { 1: “N”,
2: “C” }, and your state doesn’t change.  But if then you match a “#”,
your state function changes to { 1: 2, 2: 2 }, which is to say, always
2, and you tag it with { 1: “C”, 2: “C” }, which is to say, always
“C”.</p>
<p>If you run this algorithm over a block of data taken from the middle
of a long file, you will end up with some final state function at the
end of the block of data.  For this DFA, it will be either
{ 1: 1, 2: 2 }, { 1: 2, 2: 2 }, or { 1: 1, 2: 1 }.</p>
<p>(If you do this with an NFA instead of a DFA, your result will be a
binary relation rather than a function.)</p>
<p>If you break the file up into many blocks and run it in parallel over
each block, you will compute such a function for each block.  By
composing these functions, you can compute such a function for longer
runs of the file.  For example, if block 39 comes out to { 1: 1, 2: 2 }
and block 40 comes out to { 1: 2, 2: 2 }, then the concatenation of
blocks 39 and 40 comes out to { 1: 1, 2: 2 }.</p>
<p>If you compose these blocks into a balanced binary tree, you can then
compute the function for the whole file by propagating these functions
up the tree; functions are, of course, a monoid under composition.
Also, though, this allows you to take a known initial state and then
efficiently propagate it back <em>down</em> the tree, left to right, to every
character in the file.</p>
<p>This is the standard parallel prefix sum algorithm, applied to DFA
execution.</p>
<p>If you were doing a similar kind of tagging in an NFA, you would
probably want to only apply the tags that didn’t belong to branches of
the possibility tree that were ultimately discarded.  This involves
propagating information <em>backwards</em> as well in the down-the-tree
stage.  I think this simply involves rolling back the things that led
to intermediate states that ultimately mapped to a null set of states.</p>
<p>You could think of this transformation of the DFA from a computation
on states into a computation on functions from states to states as a
kind of abstract interpretation with non-standard semantics of the
DFA.  You can do the same kind of abstract-interpretation trick with
computational models more powerful than a DFA, although you lose the
bounded-space guarantee the DFA gives you.  For example, consider this
parenthesis-counting automaton:</p>
<pre><code>repeat:
    either:
        match "("
        n++
    or:
        match ")"
        n--
        either:
            n &gt;= 0
        or:
            n &lt; 0
            tag X
    or:
        match [^()]
</code></pre>
<p>It tags “X” whenever there’s an unmatched “)”.  You can run it in the
standard way with an initial concrete value of <code>n</code> such as 0, and it
will tell you if there are mismatched parentheses in your text, its
state at any given position being some concrete value of <code>n</code> such as
3.  Or you can run it with an initial abstract value such as <code>n₀</code>, and
its values at different positions will be further abstract values such
as <code>n₀</code> + 3 — or, you could say, λn₀.n₀ + 3.</p>
<pre><code>digraph pp {
    LR_1 [ shape=circle, label="" ];  EOF [ shape=doublecircle, label="" ];

    LR_1 -&gt; LR_1 [ label="(\nn++" ];
    LR_1 -&gt; LR_1 [ label=")\nn--\nn&gt;=0" ];
    LR_1 -&gt; LR_1 [ label=")\nn--\nn&lt;0\nX" ];
    LR_1 -&gt; LR_1 [ label="[^()]" ];
    LR_1 -&gt; EOF [ label="EOF" ];
}
</code></pre>
<p>XXX graphviz is sucking at laying out those edges and labels</p>
<p>Although this automaton has an infinite set of possible states, as
well as possible mappings from state at the beginning of a block and
state at the end of a block, and representing one of them could in
principle consume an arbitrarily large amount of space, you can apply
exactly the same approach to composing those functions into a monoid
tree.  And, as it happens, these particular mappings have a relatively
compact representation, all fitting the schema λn₀.n₀ + k.</p>
<p>It seems to me that to make the abstract interpretation tractable, you
need some kind of limitation on the power of the language — you don’t
want to have to solve the Halting Problem for one of the blocks.  I
suspect that it’s probably sufficient to forbid loops that don’t
advance through any input, but I’m not sure.</p>
<p>The objective here is to have a scripting language in which you can
conveniently express any of the monoid computations Raph talked about
in “rope science”, including word-wrap and the like, and that also
provides some kind of evaluation efficiency guarantee.  You’d like to
be able to compute, for example, that if at character 512 the carriage
position was between 110 and 170 pixels, then the word breaks
thereafter will be at characters 547, 610, 665, ..., and that at
character 1024 the carriage position will be 212; while if it was
between 170 and 220, they will be at 542, 604, 665, ... and the
carriage position at character 1024 will still be 212.  And you’d like
to be able to compute that automatically from a word-wrapping script
written in a backtracking language with numerical variables.</p>
<p>Parenthesis matching, however, is harder — the case where you want to
not just count parentheses, but also blink the matching parenthesis.
You need a stack, and the effect of running a paren-matching script
over a section of the file will be to pop some set of parens from the
stack (possibly requiring them to be of the right type) and push some
others.  Such functions can still be composed into a monoid tree, of
course.  (If you want the parenthesis locations to be integer offsets
from the beginning of the file, maybe one state variable should be the
current offset.)</p>
<p>Bjoern Hoehrmann has been working on an algorithm called “parselov”
which compiles a context-free grammar to a finite-state automaton that
approximates the CFG using a limited-depth parse stack (one stack
item, I think).</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
