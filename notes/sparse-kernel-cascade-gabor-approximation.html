<p>On the bus, thinking about vision, there occurred to me a simple way
to convolve an image with a fairly precisely approximated (real) Gabor
filter or Morlet wavelet, in fixed point, with no multipliers, and a
cascade of a small number of sparse FIR and IIR filters.  This is
probably known, but not to me.</p>
<h2>Gabor filters</h2>
<p>The general form of a Gabor wavelet in two dimensions has five
parameters: an angle <em>θ</em>, a wavelength <em>λ</em>, a phase <em>ψ</em>, a radius <em>σ</em>,
and an aspect ratio <em>γ</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter">WIKIPEDIA SAY</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>; <em>λ</em>, <em>θ</em>, <em>ψ</em>, <em>σ</em>, <em>γ</em>) =
  exp(−(<em>x</em>′<sup>2</sup> + <em>γ</em><sup>2</sup><em>y</em>′<sup>2</sup>)/(2<em>σ</em><sup>2</sup>))
  exp(<em>i</em>(2<em>π</em>x′/<em>λ</em> + <em>ψ</em>))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>x</em>′ = <em>x</em> cos <em>θ</em> + <em>y</em> sin <em>θ</em><br />
<em>y</em>′ = -<em>x</em> sin <em>θ</em> + <em>y</em> cos <em>θ</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the first exp gives you the Gaussian envelope and the second exp
gives you the oscillation.  As you might or might not guess, its
Fourier transform is <em>also</em> a Gabor wavelet.</p>
<p>You convolve this thing with an image and it detects edges at its
given angle at or near its given frequency, in the area selected by
its Gaussian window, which is nearly zero when you reach displacements
of several times <em>σ</em>, or <em>σ</em>/<em>γ</em><sup>2</sup> in the <em>y</em>′ direction.</p>
<h2>Sparse approximations</h2>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="../notes/sparse-filters.html">Sparse filters</a>, I’m looking for ways to get
good approximations of convolution filters using networks of small,
sparse kernels, to reduce the total amount of computation.  In
particular I’m interested in Hogenauer filters, which is discussed in
<a href="../notes/square-wave-filtering.html">Some speculative thoughts on DSP algorithms</a>, <a href="../notes/recurrent-comb-cascade.html">Recurrent comb cascade</a>, and <a href="../notes/cheap-frequency-detection.html">Cheap frequency detection</a>, <a href="../notes/bleep.html">The Bleep ultrasonic modem for local data communication</a>, and similar things.  In
<a href="../notes/goertzel-minsky-pll-prefix-sums.html">Using the Goertzel algorithm, the Minsky algorithm, PLLs, and prefix sums for frequency detection</a> I describe how you can use
precise resonators that are not only non-FIR but non-BIBO to very
efficiently compute precise finite infinite response filters, and I’ll
use that here.</p>
<p>I think a sparse Gabor-filter approximation is particularly
interesting because of the filter’s importance and because of its
relatively great computational cost.  (But maybe someone already knows
this algorithm.)</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The filter is a composition or pipeline of five major stages, each
composed of a cascade of small, sparse linear filters.  Because of the
convenient properties of convolution, the order of all of the
individual pieces can be reordered as desired, and in particular if
you’re computing several different Gabor filters over the same image
with some parameters in common, it may be desirable to move stages
that are in common between them to the beginning of the processing
pipeline.</p>
<p>The stages are a resonating feedback comb to create the oscillations,
an oscillation window to confine them to a Gaussian along the
direction of oscillation, a low-pass filter along the direction of
oscillation to remove frequencies higher than the desired frequency,
an antialiasing filter to deal with pixels a fraction of a sample off
the oscillation axis, and a transverse window blur to spread the
impulse response along a Gaussian at right angles to the direction of
resonation.</p>
<p>In what follows, I will suppose that the angle <em>θ</em> can be adequately
approximated as a ratio of small integers, as examples of which I will
use 3 and 4: we are looking for waves whose phase varies not at all in
the direction (<em>x</em>+3, <em>y</em>-4), and varies fastest in the direction
(<em>x</em>+4, <em>y</em>+3).  Below I will refer to this (4, 3) displacement as the
“stride”.  And I will suppose that the wavelength <em>λ</em> we’re looking
for can be adequately approximated as an integer multiple of <em>twice</em>
that displacement; that is, at some integer <em>n</em>, (<em>x</em>+8<em>n</em>, <em>y</em>+6<em>n</em>)
has a phase precisely 2<em>π</em> advanced from the phase at (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>).
There are some tricks to handle waves of other wavelengths, but they
are not as well developed.</p>
<h2>The resonating feedback comb and oscillation window</h2>
<p>To window the resonance over a given distance, we first use a feedback
comb filter whose impulse response is an infinite non-decaying
oscillation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] - <em>y</em>[<em>i</em>-4<em>n</em>, <em>j</em>-3<em>n</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, the pixel (<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>) of the output <em>y</em> is the corresponding
pixel <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] of the input, minus a <em>previous output pixel</em>
positioned exactly half an oscillation away along the line of
oscillation, at (<em>i</em>-4<em>n</em>, <em>j</em>-3<em>n</em>).  You can easily verify that the
impulse response of this filter is an alternating sequence of positive
and negative impulses leading away from the impulse in the desired
direction of oscillation.</p>
<p>To tame this wildly unstable filter, we simply use a window over some
finite number <em>m</em> of oscillations, a <em>feedforward</em> comb filter; here
our <em>x</em> input is the <em>y</em> output of the previous filter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] - <em>x</em>[<em>i</em> - 8<em>nm</em>, <em>j</em> - 6<em>nm</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When using exact arithmetic, the composition of these two filters has
a finite impulse response; in its impulse response, the alternating
positive and negative impulses generated by the first filter continue
on for <em>m</em> oscillations, then are canceled completely and precisely by
the subtraction.</p>
<p>This alternating impulse train contains our desired spatial frequency
as well as all of its odd harmonics, and the second filter just
brutally windows it with a rectangular window after some integer
number of oscillations.  The first, feedback, comb filter plays the
role of the integrator in a Hogenauer downsampling CIC filter, while
the second, feedforward, comb plays the role of the comb in the
Hogenauer filter.</p>
<p>Unlike the integrator in a Hogenauer filter, the response of the
feedback comb at DC is identically 0, and its amplification factor for
frequencies that don’t precisely align with its resonant frequency is
finite; it only fails to act BIBO if the input data actually does
contain nonzero energy at precisely the resonant frequency
(necessarily over infinite space, at least in one direction).  So you
might be able to get reasonable results using floating point, but
there are no guarantees there.</p>
<p>That window doesn’t look very Gaussian yet, so to fix that, we repeat
the process two or three more times, for a total of six to eight
atomic kernels each consisting of a single subtraction.  The window
will have the most Gaussian shape if <em>m</em> remains the same in all of
the stages, but this trades off against undesirable quantization in
the available window sizes.</p>
<p>This is one of the places where you have a little flexibility to go
beyond the limitations of the basic method; you can use resonators in
slightly different directions and frequencies to get an intermediate
overall direction and frequency of oscillation.  But the windowing
functions must be matched to those precise strides to prevent the
overall system impulse response from becoming infinite.</p>
<h2>The oscillation-axis low-pass filter</h2>
<p>The above is not yet satisfactory for two reasons.  First, we still
have the odd harmonics to deal with — the third, fifth, seventh, and
so on — which are exactly the same amplitude as the fundamental,
since it’s an impulse train.  Second, aside from those harmonics,
looked at precisely along the oscillation axis, the two stages
described above give us a very nice Gabor wavelet, but at any other
angle it looks like an impulse — all frequencies pass unchanged.</p>
<p>For these two purposes, we need to do some low-pass filtering, some of
which is transverse to the oscillation axis and is what gives us the
roundness or ellipticity of our two-dimensional Gaussian window, and
some of which is parallel to it.  And in particular, if it’s possible,
we may want to use another feedforward comb filter to stab the third
harmonic in the heart precisely, because it’s going to be the most
troublesome harmonic to handle with general-purpose low-pass
filtering, since it’s only 1.58 octaves above the fundamental, and a
filter with its first precise zero at that harmonic will suppress it
completely, as well as most of its spectral leakage.  The fifth
harmonic is 2.3 octaves above the fundamental, so a generic low-pass
filter can separate it from the fundamental pretty easily.</p>
<p>Our fundamental has a period (8<em>n</em>, 6<em>n</em>), so our third harmonic has a
period (⅓8<em>n</em>, ⅓6<em>n</em>).  We can either subtract pixels at this
displacement or add pixels at half this displacement (⅓4<em>n</em>, ⅓3<em>n</em>)
to completely suppress the third harmonic.  If these offsets are not
precise, for example because 4<em>n</em> isn’t divisible by 3, the
suppression won’t be precise either, and a lot more of the third
harmonic will survive to be dealt with by the other more generic
low-pass filtering.  (But we’ll get a little bit of bonus transverse
low-pass filtering.)</p>
<p>So the simplest form of our heart-stabbing filter would look like
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] + <em>x</em>[<em>i</em> - ⅓4<em>n</em>, <em>j</em> - ⅓3<em>n</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That taken care of, we can proceed to the oscillation-axis low-pass
filter, which is mostly important if <em>n</em> is larger than 2 or 3.
Suppose <em>n</em> = 5; now a period of the full oscillation is (40, 30).  We
can use an orthodox Hogenauer filter along the axis of oscillation to
suppress harmonics higher than the third; first an integrator
(calculating a prefix sum along each strided diagonal, also known as a
sum table, scan, or integral image):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] + <em>y</em>[<em>i</em> - 4, <em>j</em> - 3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then a feedforward comb of, for example, two strides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] - <em>x</em>[<em>i</em> - 8, <em>j</em> - 6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This amounts to a rectangular window, whose frequency response is a
sinc; its first null is where a full oscillation fits precisely into
the window, which in this case would be a period of (12, 9).  It has a
6 dB per octave frequency rolloff.</p>
<p>We probably want a better rolloff than that; if we repeat it two more
times, we get 18 dB per octave, which attenuates the fifth harmonic by
almost 42 dB, and higher harmonics by more.</p>
<p>The usual CIC-filter concerns about passband flatness don’t apply
here, since we are only trying to select a single frequency and
frequencies very close to it.</p>
<p>At higher spatial frequencies, as long as the stride is a pair of
integer number of pixels, the higher harmonics disappear because they
alias harmlessly back down into the lower harmonics.</p>
<p>So the oscillation-axis low pass filters end up being seven more
filter stages each consisting of a single addition or subtraction.
But, as we see in the next section, we will reduce this to five.</p>
<h2>The antialiasing filter</h2>
<p>So far, pixels have only ever been combined with other pixels at a
multiple of the basic stride (4, 3) from them.  This means that every
pixel in the first three lines of an image is in a separate,
noninteracting signal, so far; even very high-frequency components
will survive and may be aliased down.  We’d like to sort of “fill in”
the other pixels, at least along the axis of oscillation, rather than
skipping over them completely as if they belonged to an entirely
different image.</p>
<p>There are a variety of different ways this can be achieved.  For
example, we could use a couple of simple feedforward combs to get
reasonably good fill-in without widening the line of the OTF much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] + <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>-1, <em>j</em>-1]<br />
<em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] + <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>-2, <em>j</em>-1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let’s not do that; we can perhaps get a bit more mileage out of
the antialiasing filter in the case where the oscillation wavelength
and both dimensions of the Gaussian window and are much larger than
this; we could use, for example, a simple Gaussian blur, which also
takes some of the load off the low-pass filter along the oscillation
axis.  Again, this can be done as an orthodox Hogenauer or CIC or box
filter, but this time on the usual pixel rows and columns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] + <em>y</em>[<em>i</em>-1, <em>j</em>]<br />
<em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] - <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>-8, <em>j</em>]<br />
<em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] + <em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>-1]<br />
<em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] - <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>-6]  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cascade of those four filters has an impulse response of an 8x6
constant-1 rectangle, and in particular it has the same low-pass
effect along the axis of oscillation as the -<em>x</em>[<em>i</em> - 8, <em>j</em> - 6]
filter proposed in the section above, as well as providing
antialiasing fill-in along the axis of oscillation and some amount of
transverse window.  If you were to iterate this filter two more times
you would have a second-order approximation to a squished Gaussian,
but let’s not — let’s just run it once more and be satisfied, and
reduce the high-pass filtering from the previous section by one
filtering stage.</p>
<p>So this stage is a cascade of eight tiny kernels, each consisting of a
single addition or subtraction.</p>
<p>Since this, in effect, reduces the resolution of the image, it might
be wise to do it early on in the pipeline and then decimate the image
so that later stages can run much faster, operating on a
reduced-resolution image.</p>
<h2>The transverse window blur</h2>
<p>So at this point our impulse response is a fairly precise sinusoidal
oscillation along the correct axis, with a fairly precise Gaussian
envelope along that axis, and some sort of relatively crude smooth
falloff about 10 pixels to either side of that axis.  Now we want to
widen out that transverse axis into a Gaussian envelope, either round
or elliptical; the existing falloff may help us a bit, but we still
need to widen it out considerably.</p>
<p>We can do this with, again, a strided CIC filter, consisting of a
cascade of an integrator and a feedforward comb, but this time along
the transverse axis, using a stride rotated 90 degrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] + <em>y</em>[<em>i</em> - 3, <em>j</em> + 4]<br />
<em>y</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>] - <em>x</em>[<em>i</em> - 3<em>p</em>, <em>j</em> + 4<em>p</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here <em>p</em> gives the number of strides in the width of (one stage of)
our window, as <em>nm</em> gave the dimension of the Gaussian window in the
perpendicular direction.</p>
<p>Because of the existing falloff, we may be able to get away with one
more stage of this CIC filter at this point,
but we’ll probably need two more.</p>
<p>The direction of blurring can be chosen as either (-3, 4) or (3, -4);
I chose the first here in order to use previous scan lines rather than
previous columns, in the interest of making pipelining possible (see
below.)</p>
<p>So implementing the transverse window requires another six stages,
each consisting of an addition or subtraction.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The overall Gabor filter, then, requires a cascade of around 8 + 5 + 8
+ 6 = 26 stages, each performing a single integer addition or
subtraction, followed by some final scaling by a constant.  This is
quite small compared to the millions of pixels in the support of the
approximate Gabor wavelet that is the system’s finite impulse
response, although downsampling the image on its way into the pipeline
would reduce this disparity somewhat.</p>
<h3>Python smoke test of the algorithm</h3>
<p><a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/sparse-gabor.ipynb">I did try it in IPython tonight</a> (<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/canonical.org/%7Ekragen/sw/dev3/sparse-gabor.ipynb">notebook viewer</a>),
and got a pretty round-looking kernel with <em>n</em> = 5, <em>m</em> = 3, <em>p</em> = 30,
and the (4, 3) stride suggested above.
In plots it looks
just fine, but of course that’s not strong evidence.  I haven’t
calculated its error (that would require figuring out the diameters of
the Gaussians), but I estimate that in essentially this form it should
be able to deliver worst-case errors of less than 1% (-40 dB) and
average-case errors that are smaller still.</p>
<p>The code in the notebook boils down to something like this very crude
code, with all but the last plot stripped out:</p>

<h2>Reducing memory usage</h2>
<p>As is standard practice, you can pipeline these stages (see <a href="../notes/dsp-pipeline.html">Evaluating DSP operations in minimal buffer space by pipelining</a>) so that you don’t need 26 modified copies of the
entire image floating around in memory (some at increased precision).
But doing this in the straightforward way, scan line by scan line, you
still need a pretty big buffer to do this in, because some of the 26
stages need to look pretty far back into the past.  If we suppose <em>n</em>
= 5, <em>m</em> = 3, and <em>p</em> = 60, for example, the number of scan lines of
memory needed is as follows:</p>

<p>Whew.  That’s 1189 scan lines of memory in total, plus some fractional
scan lines I’m not considering.  Is there any way to reduce this?</p>
<p>(Well, of course there’s decimation.  But I mean aside from
decimation.)</p>
<p>I thought about tiling.  It doesn’t help, because you just switch from
having to buffer previous scan lines to having to buffer previous rows
of tiles.  In fact it hurts a little because you can’t discard
fractional tiles.  Maybe there’s still a way for it to work but I
don’t see it.</p>
<p>I thought about maintaining resonator state in a different way, using
per-pixel Minsky or Goertzel resonators, spatially shifted by varying
integer amounts per scan line, rather than a feedback comb (which is
basically a Karplus-Strong oscillator).  This might help but it only
saves you the memory needed by the resonator, which is relatively
small compared to that needed to window the oscillations.  And it
makes the assertion about the precise cancellation of windowing more
dubious, since I don’t think there’s a precise way to calculate Minsky
or Goertzel resonation.  (See <a href="../notes/goertzel-minsky-pll-prefix-sums.html">Using the Goertzel algorithm, the Minsky algorithm, PLLs, and prefix sums for frequency detection</a>.)</p>
<p>I thought about using more stages for the transverse window.  That
will give you a more precise Gaussian but uses more memory, not less.</p>
<p>If you try to use exponential blur for the transverse blur instead of
an honest Gaussian blur, you completely lose not only finite impulse
response but also zero-phase behavior.  To get zero-phase behavior
back you need to do a second pass backwards, which requires keeping
the whole result image in memory instead of just part of it.</p>
<h2>Multiple Gabor sharing</h2>
<p>So, if you’re going to do a bunch of Gabor convolutions on the same
image, what parts of the pipeline should you share between them?</p>
<p>The most computationally intensive (heh) parts of the pipeline are
those dependent on the frequency and the angle: the resonating
feedback comb, the oscillation-axis low-pass filter, and (more
loosely) the antialiasing filter.  These depend on <em>λ</em> and <em>θ</em>, but
not <em>σ</em> or <em>γ</em>.  It might make sense to move these stages, as well as
the transverse blur’s integrators, to the beginning of the pipeline so
that they can be shared between different window sizes and shapes,
running the oscillation window and the transverse blur window later,
which are only six of the 26 stages.  This probably is not practical
to do in floating-point because of the large magnitudes needed to feed
the Hogenauer-style cascade of six windowing combs.</p>
<p>The antialiasing filter is applicable over an octave or so of
frequencies at any angle (although in the above example it’s a bit
longer in one direction than the other), and the transverse-blur
integrators are applicable for any frequency at a given angle.  They
can’t both go first, though; putting the antialiasing filter first is
probably better because it allows you to decimate the image
immediately.</p>
<h2>Dealing with invalid pixels ("NA")</h2>
<p>Sometimes we can identify certain pixels as containing invalid
data — for example, they don’t work on the sensor, or they’re
suffering salt-and-pepper noise in this frame, or they’re saturated
(perhaps due to a lens flare).  Some numerical-computation
environments have special facilities for such situations; Octave and R
have “NA”, while Numpy has “masked arrays” which support most of the
same operations as ordinary arrays.</p>
<p>Dealing with such invalid pixels is a particularly tricky problem for
FFT-based convolution algorithms, since the structure of the FFT
doesn’t have a reasonable way to incorporate validity information.
R’s <code>fft</code> function, for example, will simply return an array of NA
values if asked to transform an array with a single NA value in it.
Octave, by contrast, returns an array whose values are NA only in the
phase or phases affected by the NA value — so they may have a NA real
magnitude, a NA imaginary magnitude, or both.  In either case, you
can’t use FFT convolution on a signal containing even a single invalid
pixel; the signal comes back entirely NA.</p>
<p>By contrast, a direct implementation of convolution has three
straightforward ways to handle NA values: it can propagate them to the
affected neighborhood, turning each single NA pixel into a giant NA
hole in the result; it can omit the NA pixels from the weighted sum,
increasing the weights on the other pixels to compensate, unless all
pixels with nonzero weight are NA; or it can switch between these two
strategies at some threshold of invalidity, such as 50%.  (Both
Octave’s <code>conv</code> and R’s <code>filter(method=’convolution’)</code> take the first
approach.)</p>
<p>This kind of sparse filtering using two-input kernels could take any
of these three approaches, but in the recursive case (integrators) any
of them would lead rapidly to disaster.  Probably in that case the
least bad approach is to treat NA pixels as 0 in recursive filters.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Well, really, beginnings... but it seems like this approach to
approximating convolution with a Gabor wavelet probably works and
probably is efficient (although my IPython notebook prototype
certainly is not).  It provides obvious ways to set five of the six
parameters, but not <em>ψ</em>, the phase offset.  This is a little alarming
because without the phase offset there’s no way to get the <em>complex</em>
Gabor wavelet.  It would be surprising if there turned out to be no
way to do this, but none is obvious to me at the moment.</p>
<p>(The issue is that you want to phase-shift the oscillation by a
quarter cycle, but without moving the Gaussian window along with it.
Maybe the solution could be something as simple as a differentiator in
the direction of oscillation, perhaps by a half cycle,
and a compensating constant factor.)</p>
<p>Among the possible applications are approximating an arbitrary
convolution kernel as a sum of Gabor wavelets.  One possible approach
to this is analyzing it in different directions and at different
scales using the Gabor transform or the one-dimensional wavelet
transform with the Morlet wavelet, choosing a sparse subset of these
basis functions that could possibly approximate the target kernel
well, then optimizing the weights of that sparse subset further, under
a loss function that drives small weights toward zero.</p>
<p>Moreover, there’s no particular reason to limit yourself entirely to
Gabor wavelets when optimizing that approximation; you can include
other kernels that can be computed efficiently using such sparse
cascades, such as separable kernels (see <a href="../notes/svd-convolution.html">The miraculous low-rank SVD approximate convolution algorithm</a>), flat
and especially polygonal kernels (see <a href="../notes/convolution-bokeh.html">Real-time bokeh algorithms, and other convolution tricks</a>), and,
using the techniques used above to propagate the Gabor’s oscillation
along a line, line segments.</p>
<p>Another possible application is the design of transmission-line RF
filters, including stripline/microstrip transmission lines built into
printed circuit boards, and waveguide filters — though I’m not sure
how much that will buy you, given the need for matching networks to
interconnect the signal paths.  An open-ended transmission line spur
is in some sense a unity-positive-weight feedforward comb filter whose
lag is twice the length of the line, while a closed-ended one amounts
to a unity-negative-weight feedforward comb filter, similarly.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
