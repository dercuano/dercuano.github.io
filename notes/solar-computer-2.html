(3 minutes)</div><p>Solar panels are now down below US$1 per watt; some of them are 22%
efficient, which works out to about 220W/m² in full sunlight.  The
Dell Inspiron Mini 10 netbook I'm typing this on is 26.8cm × 19.7cm,
or about 0.05 m²; a solar panel occupying that space would yield
almost 12 W in full sunlight.  The keyboard is big enough to type on
comfortably.</p>
<p>Suppose you wanted to design a computer in this form factor that could
run off such a solar panel, without a battery.  If you covered one
side of it with a US$10 solar cell, then at times it might have up to
10 watts available, but often it would need to run on 1W or less, and
it would have to handle the loss of power well: ideally without the
screen going blank or losing data or anything.  Even 1W is a lot
better than you can reasonably provide with a handcrank, and it’s
solid state.</p>
<p>Probably you need an E-Ink screen (so you can keep reading without
using energy), a couple of different processors, a physical keyboard,
some capacitors, and Flash storage would be in order (although FRAM,
MRAM, or PCM might also work; I suspect MRAM has longer retention; but
NAND Flash is huge compared to the others.  Any kind of HTML5 site is
going to suck shit at best.</p>
<h2>E-Ink screens</h2>

is a 172×72 pixel SPI e-paper display
<a href="http://www.lcd-module.com/fileadmin/eng/pdf/grafik/epa20-ae.pdf">http://www.lcd-module.com/fileadmin/eng/pdf/grafik/epa20-ae.pdf</a> of
59.2mm × 29.2mm for US$46.28; it runs on 3.3 volts.  This is
unacceptably lame compared to a Swindle screen.</p>

is a US$50 E-ink display which is supposedly 6", 1280×1024, 5ms
response time, and 16.7 million colors, which I don’t trust one word
of except that they’ll take your US$50.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Original-ED060SC4-ED060SC4-LF-6-e-ink-ebook-LCD-screen-for-Amazon-kindle-2-for-PocketBook/32242651648.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Original-ED060SC4-ED060SC4-LF-6-e-ink-ebook-LCD-screen-for-Amazon-kindle-2-for-PocketBook/32242651648.html</a>
is a "100% Original ED060SC4 ED060SC4(LF) 6” E-link EBook LCD screen
for Amazon kindle 2 for PocketBook 301 plus for Sony PRS500 600”.  For
US$14.  I think I believe this one.  The PocketBook 301+, from 2009,
has an 800×600 16-level grayscale display, and this does seem to be
it.</p>
<p>A datasheet at <a href="http://essentialscrap.com/eink/ED060SC4V2.pdf">http://essentialscrap.com/eink/ED060SC4V2.pdf</a> reveals
details.  It's 122.4mm × 90.6mm (or 137.9mm × 104.1mm around the
outside), about 21% of the size of this netbook, so using two might be
good: 1200×800 total pixels for US$28.  (Or maybe three.)  800 pixels
over 122.4mm is 153μm/pixel, so a 12-point letter is about 28px tall
by 14px wide.  It has a 39-pin interface, needs negative and positive
20 volts or so to run it, updates in 1000ms, and uses 600–1250mW while
it’s doing so, so about 1 J per screen update, or about 2μJ per pixel
update, 48 μJ per tiny 4×6 letter displayed, 80 μJ per small 5×8
letter displayed, or 784 μJ per 12-point letter.</p>
<p>That datasheet does not reveal the protocols to use to control it, but
those should be available from somewhere, or for some similar display.
They’re clearly parallel, so you need about 25 GPIOs to control it.</p>
<p>784μJ per letter is 4.7 mJ per 6-character word, so reading at 350wpm
would consume 1.6 joules per minute, or an average of 27mW.</p>
