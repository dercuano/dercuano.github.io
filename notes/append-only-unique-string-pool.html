(2 minutes)</div><p>A couple of systems I’ve been dealing with recently involve reading in
a bunch of strings (up to a few million) as fast as possible, storing
them in minimal space, and then retrieving them by index.  It may turn
out in these cases for space reasons to be advantageous to deduplicate
the strings, but we can’t afford a lot of hashing or hash search time.</p>
<p>The most space-efficient solution to the problem (without resorting to
compression) is just to concatenate the strings with delimiters in
between, or better, preceded by a variable-length count.  Then,
retrieving string i requires iterating over the i preceding strings.</p>
<p>That’s unacceptably slow both for indexing and for searching for
duplicates.  If you store a separate array of the indices of the
starts of the strings, you can quickly index, but on a 64-bit machine,
that array may be rather large; it may be more practical to store the
start index of, say, every 8th or 16th string, and then, in a separate
array of 16-bit values, the lengths of all the strings.  These lengths
only cost one more byte per string than inline delimiters, make the
system 8-bit clean, and allow for strings up to 64KiB.  Now we have
constant-time indexing.</p>
<p>Finding duplicate strings requires some kind of additional index, of
which a hash table is the simplest.  It has the problem that it
potentially needs a lot of space if it’s full of pointers to strings,
and I don't have any particularly clever solution to that, but it
shouldn’t use much extra time if collisions can be kept low enough; in
particular, you can compute the hash function as you’re copying the
incoming string into the place it will be occupying in the
concatenated strings if it turns out not to be a duplicate.  For very
long duplicate strings, this copy will result in extra memory
bandwidth, but for short strings and non-duplicate strings, it won’t.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
