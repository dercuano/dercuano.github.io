(4 minutes)</div><p>I'm suffering quite a bit from trying to use Linux, Windows, and MacOS
on current hardware.  There's no reason, for example, for this laptop to
spend thirty seconds or more to become ready for use when I want to use
it.  Its video display holds perhaps 3 megabytes of data, and it's
capable of reproducing 60fps fullscreen 1024x600 video, which means it
can draw the full screen contents, including running the video codec, in
16ms.  30 seconds is 1800 times longer than it ought to take to get to a
useful screen.</p>
<p>There are responsiveness and performance problems all over the place.
It's totally unacceptable that Ubuntu's pretty main menu takes three
seconds or more to come up when I press the Windows key.  Alt-tab
between two windows that are already open has a noticeable delay, which
means it's over 200ms.  And, although the machine has a gigabyte of RAM,
it frequently runs into OOM kills and memory-shortage kernel panics.
Even on Ubuntu machines that aren't suffering from that particular problem, the
machine often has to swap for a few seconds in order for the screen saver
to display its password prompt.</p>
<p>And then there are things that just don't work.  The trackpad stopped
working (maybe when I rebooted with Ubuntu 12.04).  The wireless
disconnects and then won't reconnect without rebooting, a problem I also
had with Ubuntu 8.04 on a Dell Vostro 9.  The machine doesn't sleep when
I close the lid, and when I sleep with the sleep key, it doesn't wake up
reliably --- sometimes it gets into a mode where the screen turns on
after every keystroke for 100ms or so.</p>
<p>I suspect that a lot of these problems are a result of the monolithic
kernel design.  This kernel has 43 modules loaded, including modules for
the sound, the wireless, the mouse, the nonexistent parallel port, and the
nonexistent Bluetooth interface.  None of these can be restarted
cleanly, and a bug in any of these subsystems can cause problems in the
system as a whole, and although this is of course also the case with any
driver that controls hardware that supports DMA, many pieces of hardware
nowadays don't support DMA, or support DMA only in well-defined ways,
e.g. via USBI UHCI.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although it's often possible to work around bugs in these
subsystems by rebooting the machine, the kernel that gets rebooted is
also the kernel that's running all your applications, so your
applications lose their state too --- even though there's really no
possibility that vi, Emacs, the GIMP, Firefox, or GnuCash has runtime
state that's so tightly coupled with your video card that it can't be
reasonably preserved across a restart.</p>
<p>On top of all this, sound often skips when playing MP3s if there's other
stuff going on, like a compile or some web browsing.</p>
<p>So I propose a new system architecture for end-user free-software
systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>a small hard-real-time hypervisor that's responsible for providing a
  trusted path to a low-latency user interface, protecting access to
  any DMA-capable hardware, and checkpointing and resuming
  virtual-machine images running under it;</li>
<li>a display server running directly under the real-time hypervisor,
  handling the keyboard, mouse, and monitor, which is unavoidably part
  of the TCB because it provides the trusted user interface path;</li>
<li>a Linux kernel, or several, running under the real-time hypervisor to
  handle other devices that need DMA; this is unfortunately part of the
  TCB.</li>
<li>a separate Linux kernel, or several, running applications that don't
  need direct access to hardware at all; these can be checkpointed and
  resumed without knowledge of the applications.</li>
<li>other Linux kernels to run applications that need direct access to
  hardware that doesn't do DMA.  These can't be checkpointed and
  restarted, but they also aren't part of the TCB.</li>
