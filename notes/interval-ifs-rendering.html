(6 minutes)</div><p>Not sure if this is a new IFS-rendering idea or not, but I was
thinking about a recursive algorithm I'd written to render implicit
functions using interval arithmetic, and it occurred to me that you
can perhaps use it to do efficient escape-time IFS rendering.</p>
<p>Interval arithmetic computes with intervals of real numbers rather
than pointwise real numbers; (-1, -½) / (-3, -2) evaluates to (⅙, ½),
for example, because any number in the interval (-1, -½) divided by
any number in the interval (-3, -2) will give a number in the interval
(⅙, ½); and, if there's no further relationship between the numerator
and the denominator, it can give <em>any</em> number in that interval.</p>
<p>This is a kind of very simple abstract interpretation; it gives you a
conservative approximation of what values a function can range over,
given a conservative approximation of its inputs.  If you're, say,
just looking for zeroes of the function, you can disregard whole
swaths of its domain once you've computed that the function's range
over that part of its domain is strictly positive, strictly negative,
or (in the case of multi-interval arithmetic, which is useful for
handling division by zero) a union of the two; this can give you
asymptotic speedups.</p>
<p>My 2-D implicit rendering algorithm with interval arithmetic, inspired
by my very limited understanding of Flórez Díaz's 2008 raytracing
thesis, works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>evaluates the given function over X and Y intervals covering
the entire canvas to be drawn;</li>
<li>if the output interval it computed excludes zero, it is done;</li>
<li>otherwise, if it is now evaluating deep-subpixel intervals, it
simply draws white;</li>
<li>otherwise, it divides the rectangle into thirds, and recurses on
the thirds.  (Halves or fourths or any other number works too, but is
less efficient.)</li>
</ol>
<p>So it occurred to me that you can compute a similar kind of
approximation of an IFS's attractor by escape-time analysis.  You can
run an IFS either forward (toward the attractor) or backward (away
from it).  If you run it forward, regardless of which transform you
choose, you will stay on the attractor if you're already there, and
approximate the attractor more closely if you're not; while if you run
it backward, even if you're in the attractor, most choices of
transform will generally push you off of it, while there exists at
least one choice (generally exactly one) that will keep you on the
attractor.  This means you have to <em>search</em> for the correct choice.</p>
<p>So I propose that you divide the canvas into a k-d tree, as in my
implicit-function rendering algorithm, but one that remains stored, in
which each node (bounding box, let's say, or just "box") is in one of
three states:</p>
<ol>
<li>it's known to not overlap the attractor;</li>
<li>it's known to be entirely inside the attractor, which I believe is
   only applicable if the attractor has Hausdorff dimension the same
   as the space we're working in;</li>
<li>it's suspected to overlap the attractor.</li>
</ol>
<p>We iteratively look for nodes in state 3 that are still big enough to
be interesting for our purposes, and we transform them with all of the
transforms at our disposal, both forward and reverse.  If <em>any</em>
forward transform leaves its image entirely inside a node in state 2,
then this node also changes to state 2; if <em>all</em> reverse transforms
leave its image entirely inside a node in state 1, then this node also
changes to state 1.</p>
<p>This also suggests that we should link nodes in state 3 to the other
state-3 nodes that we have discovered to be able to transform to and
from them, so that we can propagate state changes properly when we
change the state of a state-3 node.</p>
<p>Once this link structure has been discovered, though, we choose a
state-3 node to divide into pieces, and transform it again.
Presumably once the pieces are small enough, we will choose to stop
subdividing, but smaller pieces might transform entirely within a
state-1 or state-2 node.</p>
<p>But how do we get any state-1 or state-2 nodes to begin with? If we
can compute a conservative bounding box for the attractor to start
with, then boxes outside that bounding box will be in state 1, but
state 2 is a little trickier.  To find the fixed point of any of the
transforms, we can solve some simultaneous linear equations, or just
exponentiate the transform, since it's contractive.  But that still
just gives us a point (a unique point, by the Banach fixed-point
theorem) rather than an interval that could actually contain another
interval inside of it.</p>
<p>And indeed many IFSs will contain no such intervals that are entirely
inside their attractors.  Others, however, do; consider the 1-D IFS
f₁(x) = x/2, f₂(x) = (x+1)/2, whose attractor solidly covers the space
between 0 and 1; or the 2-D IFS</p>
<pre><code>f₁(x, y) = (x/2,     y/2)
f₂(x, y) = ((x+1)/2, y/2)
f₃(x, y) = (x/2,     (y+1)/2)
f₄(x, y) = ((x+1)/2, (y+1)/2)
</code></pre>
<p>which I believe similarly solidly covers the square you would expect
it to.</p>
<p>State 1 and state 3 are clearly enough to render a fractal, but if
your particular IFS has state-2 regions in it, then it will be
exponentially more efficient to be able to recognize them, since
you'll be able to focus on the boundary of the set instead of deeply
recursing on the whole thing.  I just don't know how yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I think this algorithm, even without state 2, should scale
with an exponent very nearly the Hausdorff dimension of the IFS you're
looking at, multiplied by the number of IFS transforms.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
