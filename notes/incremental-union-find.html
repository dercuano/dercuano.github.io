<p>The union-find data structure, sometimes called a disjoint-set forest,
is a well-known data structure that pops up in, for example,
constructing minimum spanning trees; it efficiently supports the
operations <em>component</em>(<em>n</em>) and <em>connect</em>(<em>n</em>₁, <em>n</em>₂).  You are
guaranteed that <em>component</em>(<em>n</em>) == <em>component</em>(<em>m</em>) if and only if
there is a (possibly empty) set of past <em>connect</em> calls that create a
path between <em>n</em> and <em>m</em> — if the <em>connect</em> calls create arcs in a
graph, they are in the same component.  Moreover, you can intersperse
<em>component</em> and <em>connect</em> calls freely without losing efficiency, and
the structure uses only O(<em>N</em>) space, where <em>N</em> is the number of
nodes, not even the number of arcs.</p>
<p>However, the standard structure does not support edge <em>deletion</em>, only
edge <em>creation</em>.  It seems probably impossible for a structure with
the same space performance to support such an operation, since its
size must remain unchanged as O(<em>N</em>) despite the creation of O(<em>N</em>²)
edges, any of which can later be deleted.  But is there a way to
support edge deletion with “reasonable” performance?</p>
<h2>The standard union-find data structure</h2>
<p>Here’s an implementation of the standard union-find algorithm I wrote
last year as part of <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/unimaze.go">a maze generation program</a> in Golang:</p>
<pre><code>// Data structure for rapidly determining whether two maze cells are
// already connected.
type Unionfind map[Cell]Cell

func (u Unionfind) root(c Cell) (root Cell) {
        parent, ok := u[c]
        if !ok {
                return c
        }
        root = u.root(parent)
        u[c] = root
        return
}

func (u Unionfind) Connect(start, end Cell) {
        u[u.root(start)] = u.root(end)
}

func (u Unionfind) Connected(a, b Cell) bool {
        return u.root(a) == u.root(b)
}
</code></pre>
<p>For convenience, this implementation uses a Golang <code>map</code> to store the
parent pointers; you can use a plain array of integers if you identify
your nodes with integers, size the array to be big enough, reserve a
distinguished integer to mean “nil”, no parent, and initialize by
filling the array with “nil”.  (Alternatively, instead of setting root
nodes’ parents to a nil value, you can make them their own parents.)</p>
<p>Analyzing the performance of this algorithm is difficult enough that I
am not going to try (though there is an extensive literature on the
subject), but you can see that <code>root()</code> is O(1) whenever it is called
a second time on the same node without an intervening <code>Connect()</code> call
that would change its return value, because it recurses at most once.
In such a case it does two <code>u[c]</code> lookups in the map, the second of
which fails, and one (redundant) <code>u[c]</code> update.</p>
<p>For this algorithm variant (“path compression without union by rank”),
CLRS gives a worst-case running time of Θ(<em>n</em> + <em>f</em> (1 + log<sub>2 +
<em>f</em>/<em>n</em></sub> <em>n</em>)) for <em>n</em> - 1 <code>Connect</code> calls and ½<em>f</em> <code>Connected</code>
calls (p. 571).  When <em>f</em> ≫ <em>n</em> this function is very nearly <em>n</em> +
<em>f</em>; when <em>f</em> ≪ <em>n</em> it is <em>n</em> + <em>f</em> lg <em>n</em>; and when <em>f</em> ≈ <em>n</em> it is
about <em>n</em> + <em>f</em> ln <em>n</em>.  The “path compression with union by rank”
variant is asymptotically faster, but it requires a great deal of
extra bookkeeping information and has a larger constant factor; it
uses twice as much space and, until <em>n</em> is fairly large, it’s also
slower.  If <em>f</em> is much larger than <em>n</em>, it’s slower even then.</p>
<h2>A logarithmic-time union-find with edge deletion (or maybe not)</h2>
<p>Suppose that, instead of parent pointers, we maintain, for each node,
a linked list of edges, each indicating a lower-numbered node that it
is directly linked to.  Now <code>Connect()</code> merely has to determine which
node has the higher number and add the edge to that node’s edge list,
but <code>root()</code> becomes infeasible except by groveling over the entire
set of nodes repeatedly.  To avoid this, we add the parent pointers
back in, but in the form of an additional linked list of edges on each
node — but these edges are edges between components, not just between
nodes.  These are established using essentially the same rule as
before, with the additional proviso that they must point from a higher
to a lower node, like the edges between nodes.  So now <code>Connect()</code>
must create both a between-nodes edge and a between-components edge,
and unlike before, it does not delete a between-components edge.</p>
<p>Every edge (in the between-nodes list or the between-components list)
has a list of dependent between-components edges attached to it.  If
that edge is removed, its dependents are also removed; and since those
dependents may have further dependents, those further dependents are
also removed.  When a between-components edge is created, it becomes a
dependent of the between-nodes edge that was created at the same time
(if any), as well as all of the between-components edges that were
followed for its creation.  The logic of <code>root()</code> now must handle the
situation of multiple “parent pointers” (that is, between-components
edges); it always follows the pointer that points to the
lowest-numbered node, since this (XXX I think) is guaranteed to be the
most-recently-created surviving parent pointer.</p>
<p>XXX If a between-components edge is deleted because it depended on
another between-components edge that has been deleted, but it was
added together with a between-nodes edge, should it be recreated from
its original between-nodes edge?</p>
<p>Hmm, I was thinking that I could replace the single-hop parent
pointers with a logarithmic number of parent pointers, each traveling
up the parent chain by a power of 2, or roughly so, sort of like a
skip list, in order to keep the space and time overhead both bounded
at logarithmic.  But I’m not sure any variant of this approach will
work at all.</p>
<h2>Merging union-find structures?</h2>
<p>Suppose you have built two union-find structures on the same set of
nodes by applying two some potentially large sets of <em>connect</em>
operations.  How can you compute the union-find structure that would
have been computed from the union of those two sets of edges?</p>
<p>One way to do it is to determine whether the second set contains any
edges that bridge components that are separate in the first
set — which is to say, whether there are any pairs of nodes that are
connected in the second set but not the first.  If so, you can apply
additional <em>connect</em> operations to the first set to unify them.</p>
<p>To connect, in the first structure, all the pairs of nodes that are
connected in the second set, it is adequate to connect each node to
either its root or its parent (in both cases, in the second union-find
structure).  That is, the parent pointers provide adequate information
for this task; they are a compressed summary of the original second
set of edges.</p>
<p>This merge operation suggests that we could build a binary tree of
union-find structures in which, at the leaves, we have individual
edges (that is, union-find structures containing only a single edge).
Then, to remove an edge, we null out its leaf and propagate the merge
operations back up to the root.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although we need only walk through O(lg <em>E</em>) nodes, we
are doing O(<em>N</em>) work at each node.  It would be faster to just
recompute the union-find from scratch, unless there are many more
edges than nodes.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
