<p>Suppose we have a function to compute some value:</p>
<pre><code>def f(a, b, c):
    if get(a, 3) &gt; 5:
        return get(b)-get("x")
    else:
        return get(c)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we run this function in an environment where we will record its
return value where we will record its return value for the results of
pending or future calls to <code>get()</code>.  (So far I haven't specified how
<code>f</code> gets associated with some value you can pass to <code>get</code>.)  We also
record its calls to <code>get</code> as resulting from this invocation of <code>f</code> and
may even throw exceptions from some of the <code>get</code> calls, for example if
their values are not known yet, exceptions which will be caught by the
context that invoked <code>f</code>.  Now we know which set of <code>get</code> invocations
the current return value of a particular call to <code>f</code> depends upon:
clearly <code>f(3, "/", "@")</code> invokes <code>get(3, 3)</code>, and if that returns 4,
it will cause it toinvoke <code>get("@")</code>.  Now we can infer that the
return value of <code>f(3, "/", "@")</code> depends only on <code>get(3, 3)</code> returning
4 and on <code>get("@")</code> returning whatever it returned at the time; so
it's valid to cache <code>f(3, "/", "@")</code> until one of those two values
changes.  In particular, we do not need to worry about <code>get("/")</code> or
<code>get("x")</code>, since they weren't invoked.  But if <code>get(3, 3)</code> changes
its return value, then the cached value for <code>f(3, "/", "@")</code> is no
longer valid, and when a new value for it is computed, it might have a
different set of dependencies — it might depend on <code>get("@")</code>, for
example.</p>
<p>This allows us to write code in a fairly imperative style and
automatically transform it into a reactive dependency-driven
computation.</p>
<h2>Meteor's implementation</h2>
<p><a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#reactivity">Meteor's <code>Deps</code> facility</a> is
probably the most popular implementation of this in practice today,
although I first encountered a variant of it in the paper that
popularized software transactional memory, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/67418/2005-ppopp-composable.pdf" title="Harris, Marlow, Peyton Jones, and Herlihy">Composable Memory
Transactions</a>, in 2005; and <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/Trellis">The
Trellis</a> is an older
Python package that does the same thing.  <code>Deps</code> has a few surprising
design choices, which are interesting in that they represent the
experience of Meteor's developers and users using it extensively in
practice over the last two years, rather than merely in theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its implementation supports nesting;</li>
<li>If an exception is thrown the first time a computation is invoked,
  it prevents the computation from ever being rerun in the future;
  there's also an explicit <code>computation.stop()</code> API to prevent this.</li>
<li>Computations are rerun eagerly when their dependencies change, but
  only once the system is idle or someone calls <code>Deps.flush</code>, which
  you can't do from inside a Computation; this enables you to use them
  to e.g. update the DOM in the page rather than just producing a
  return value, and the delay-until-idle makes them serializable so
  that one Computation doesn't see partial updates produced by
  another Computation not having finished;</li>
<li>they additionally have an <code>onInvalidate</code> callback which is invoked
  immediately when their result is invalidated;</li>
<li>Computations normally communicate with one another by writing to a
  shared global store (e.g. the database, which is replicated onto the
  MongoDB server) rather than by nested invocation, although nested
  invocation is also supported;</li>
<li>
<p>dependency links have separate identity from the variables they
  track:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason Dependencies do not store data themselves is that it
can be useful to associate multiple Dependencies with the same
piece of data. … A Dependency could represent whether the weather
is sunny or not, or whether the temperature is above
freezing. <code>Session.equals</code> is implemented this way for
efficiency. When you call <code>Session.equals("weather", "sunny")</code>,
the current computation is made to depend on an internal
Dependency that does not change if the weather goes from, say,
<code>"rainy"</code> to <code>"cloudy"</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependency links remove their dependent computations after
  invalidating them, trusting that they will re-add the dependency
  again if necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been told by Meteor users that Meteor doesn't have transactions,
but the Computation and Dependency objects described here are
essentially the same ones that implement transactions in a software
transactional memory system: a Computation is a transaction, and its
Dependencies are the variables it reads.  (It just doesn't support
rollback, which would require at least logging the variables it writes
in order to undo the effect.)</p>
<h2>Continuously changing variables</h2>
<p>Time changes continuously, so in the simplest possible system, any
transaction that depends on the current time will be constantly
invalidated, and thus constantly recomputed if you're using an eager
re-evaluation strategy.  But, as the <code>Session.equals</code> example above
from Meteor shows, in some cases you can make the transaction's
dependency considerably more specific.  You could say <code>if
time.between(nyc.hour(10,00), nyc.hour(10,05))":</code>, for example, so
that your transaction would only be rerun upon crossing the 10:00 or
10:05 boundary.</p>
<p>This is difficult to generalize, but there are ad-hoc approaches that
may work well in practice.  For example, you could sample a variable
periodically, and assume that it doesn't change at other times.
Meteor in fact does this on the server to detect MongoDB changes that
aren't intermediated by Meteor itself.</p>
<h2>Dependencies with exceptions as a substitute for futures</h2>
<p>Futures are a mechanism for writing code that computes with data that
aren't known yet — actually, several similar mechanisms.  The first
was <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6095/AIM-454.pdf?sequence=2">proposed by Baker and Hewitt in AIM-454 in
1977</a>.
They used "future" to refer to more or less what we know in Haskell as
a "lazy value" — Baker and Hewitt were proposing that structuring the
program's run-time state as a pure dependency graph, and then eagerly
computing it in parallel while incrementally garbage-collecting the
parts of the dataflow graph that had been cut off by a conditional,
would be a good way to write parallel programs to efficiently compute
on massive multiprocessors.  They turned out to be wrong about that,
but nobody would actually build a massive multiprocessor until 1983,
so we have to give them credit for trying.  (Besides, it's not too far
off from <code>make -j 16</code>, which is an effective way to program moderately
massive multiprocessors, and Stu Feldman wrote the first,
non-parallel, version of <code>make</code> only the year before.)</p>
<p>Basically their mechanism was that your computation would block when
it attempted to apply a primitive operation such as arithmetic to a
future, unblocking once the value was available.</p>
<p>Composable Memory Transactions proposes that transactions can "block"
by, essentially, throwing an exception (called <code>retry</code> in the paper)
which aborts the transaction, marking it to be retried when one of its
dependencies changes.  As long as the code inside the transaction
really has no communications with the outside world that aren't
intermediated by the transactional memory (a <a href="http://joeduffyblog.com/2010/01/03/a-brief-retrospective-on-transactional-memory/">problem cited by Joe
Duffy in 2010 as one of the killers of
STM.NET</a>),
then the effect is very similar to the transaction magically not being
able to execute at all until one of the dependencies that would guide
it toward the fatal exception is modified.  It's like the system knows
that the transaction would fail, so it doesn't attempt it, and it
magically knows what inputs the transaction takes.  (Of course this
won't work in systems like Meteor that don't support rollback.)</p>
<p>Consider this Python code to calculate how much a share of AT&amp;T stock
costs in pounds sterling:</p>
<pre><code>def t_in_gbp():
    quotes_csv = "http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv"
    data_url = lambda sym: quotes_csv + "?f=sl1d1t1c1ohgv&amp;e=.csv&amp;s=" + sym
    t_data   = www.get(data_url("T"),        max_age=minutes(5))
    gbp_data = www.get(data_url("GBPUSD=X"), max_age=minutes(5))
    price = lambda text: float(csv.reader(StringIO(text)).next()[1])
    return price(t_data) / price(gbp_data)
</code></pre>
<p>You could implement this using blocking HTTP client calls, storing the
result in a cache, and then, to get concurrency, spawn off a separate
thread for each such computation, sharing the result between threads.
As an alternative to threads, though, you could run <code>t_in_gbp</code> in a
transaction and have <code>www.get</code> try to fetch the data from the cache,
initiating the fetch and aborting the transaction if the cached data
is stale.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
