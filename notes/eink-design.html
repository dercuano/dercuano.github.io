<p>(Previously published at <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/eink-design">http://canonical.org/~kragen/eink-design</a>.)</p>
<p>NinjaTrappeur built the <a href="https://alternativebit.fr/posts/ultimate-writer/">Ultimate Writer</a>, a cypress TV typewriter
for undistracted writing, and reports that writing in it is tolerable
despite the e-ink display’s 3-second update delay, but editing is
intolerable.</p>
<p>If you want to design a text editor for low-power e-ink displays, you
probably want to minimize the number of pixels you update per
character (and especially minimize full-screen refreshes) and also
avoid unexpected full-screen refreshes.  That’s because full screen
updates take longer than partial screen updates and because they use a
lot more energy.</p>
<p>This means that running vi or even ed on a standard terminal emulator
is not going to work very well.  Scrolling the whole screen up every
time you want to display a new line at the bottom involves a waste of
time and energy.</p>
<h2>Variations of scrolling</h2>
<p>You can get a substantial improvement over scrolling, without changing
the underlying typewriter model of ed/ex, in at least a couple of
ways: the ntalk/Tek4014 approach and the Emacs approach.</p>
<p>In ntalk, when your typing reached the bottom of your text window, you
would wrap back around to the top, which would erase a couple of lines
there.  Erasing then proceeded one line at a time, always leaving a
blank line below the text you were currently typing and above the
oldest surviving text.  No text ever moved; it remained until it was
erased.  This was a good match for the capabilities of “intelligent”
terminals like the ADM3A which could put text anywhere on the screen
but had no way of moving it once it was there.</p>
<p>The Tektronix 4014 did something similar, except that it had two
columns (the screen was wide enough that typical lines of text fit
into a single column) and couldn’t do partial display erases — its
“direct-view bistable storage tube” could only be erased all at once,
although it permitted incremental drawing.  So if you wrapped around
to the first column again, you usually needed to request a screen
erase in order to see more text.</p>
<p>In Emacs, when you reach the bottom of a window and try to go further
down, it scrolls — but not by a single line.  Instead, it scrolls by a
whole half screenful.  This is more expensive than the ntalk approach,
and it does involve a full screen refresh (slow on either e-ink or the
serial lines common when GNU Emacs was being designed), but it’s a
reasonable balance of efficiency and hysteresis:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you’re typing lines one after another in this system, each line
   gets displayed twice: once when you initially type it, and a second
   time when it scrolls up by half a screenful.  After a second
   scrolling event, it’s no longer visible.  This thus implies a
   multiplier of 2× over the minimal possible expense of displaying
   and erasing the line once, as in the ntalk approach.  This compares
   to 30× for the standard line-by-line approach, if the display is 30
   lines high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re moving down, and then you decide to move back up, this
   does not require scrolling, unless you move up by an entire
   half-window-height.  The maximum possible distance over which you
   could avoid scrolling would be a whole window height, which is what
   the usual scrolling algorithm provides.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the Emacs approach provides half the hysteresis of the best
possible hysteresis, and half the efficiency of the best possible
efficiency.</p>
<p>However, the problem with editing doesn’t end with an efficient
simulation of a teletype.</p>
<h2>Editing and repainting</h2>
<p>Screen editors like vim and Emacs display a window onto the document
you’re editing on your display and keep it constantly updated; the
slogan at the time was “WYSIWYG”, “what you see is what you get”.
(Later that slogan was repurposed to distinguish editors that did
on-screen justification and multiple fonts, rather than displaying raw
markup.)  For changes that amount to adding or removing text at the
beginning or end of the document, or overwriting text in the middle,
the only required repainting of existing text consists of scrolling,
which can be minimized as described above.  But most changes in screen
editors consist of inserting or deleting text in the middle of a
document.  In the WYSIWYG paradigm, this requires repainting a lot of
existing text either after every new line or even after every
keystroke, which is a major cost on these displays.</p>
<p>The pre-WYSIWYG editor paradigm was the “line editor” paradigm,
exemplified by ed, ex, or EDLIN.  Line editors are designed for
teletypes: you type lines of commands at them, and they “print” lines
of results back at you, always adding lines at the bottom.  You could
clearly use this approach with one of the “variations of scrolling”
mentioned above.</p>
<p>However, it won’t be very efficient, because sooner or later you’ll
want to see if you modified the text the way you intended.  And the
only way the line-editor paradigm has to show it to you is for you to
“print out” some lines, including both modified and unmodified text.
So you may end up redisplaying the same unmodified text several times
within the same screenful of typeout, which is an inefficient use of
e-ink, and furthermore of screen real estate, unless the edit history
was really what you wanted to focus on, as opposed to the end result.</p>
<p>Here’s a short example ex session, although it’s using the somewhat
ersatz implementation of ex included in vim.  Note the abundance of
redundant text repaints:</p>
<pre><code>$ ex eink-design
"eink-design" [noeol] 108L, 5582C

<h2>Blanks and strikethrough</h2>
<p>vi, as opposed to vim, was largely written on an ADM-3A, which didn’t
have any capability of moving around text that was already on the
display; the best you could do was to redraw it in a new place.
Perhaps as a result, in vi, when you use the “c” change command, which
deletes a specified span of text and puts you in insert mode to type
new text to replace it with, vi doesn’t delete the text on the
display, shifting the following text to the left.  Instead, it marks
the end of the deleted text with a <code>$</code>, and no text moves unless you
insert more text than was deleted.  It doesn’t even remove the deleted
text from the screen until you leave insert mode.  This reduces
repaint traffic considerably on terminals like the ADM-3A.</p>
<p>On an e-ink display, something like vi’s approach here might be
useful, but we could carry it further.  For example, if you start
inserting into the middle of a line, we could open up a big blank for
you to type in, maybe half the length of the line.  It might look like
this, using | for the cursor (which wouldn’t really take up space) and
displaying successive screen states on successive lines:</p>
<pre><code>On an e-ink display, something like| might be
On an e-ink display, something like |_______________________________________ might be
On an e-ink display, something like vi’s ap|________________________________ might be
On an e-ink display, something like vi’s approach h|________________________ might be
On an e-ink display, something like vi’s approach here|_____________________ might be
On an e-ink display, something like vi’s approach here______________________ mi|ght be
</code></pre>
<p>This way, there’s a single erase and repaint of “might be” at the
beginning of the process, and perhaps another one later if you type
enough into the blank, followed by a final one when the system decides
you’re done editing there, perhaps because you moved to a different
line, or started inserting text somewhere else:</p>
<pre><code>On an e-ink display, something like vi’s approach here might be
</code></pre>
<p>For deletion rather than insertion, you could use strikethrough
analogously to avoid moving other text around, as Microsoft Word does
in Track Changes mode.  If the text previously read “something like
this might be”, and the user deleted "this", it might display at that
point as follows:</p>
<pre><code>On an e-ink display, something like t̶h̶i̶s̶| might be
</code></pre>
<p>The horizontal insertion space may not be adequate once text has to
move vertically as well as horizontally to accommodate your edit.  In
that case, you might want to do something analogous vertically: open
up half a screenful of blank space in order to insert new text into,
expanding it a half-screenful at a time.  You’d probably want to mark
it somehow to indicate that it “wasn’t real”.</p>
<p>This scheme is fairly close to the buffer-gap scheme Emacs uses
internally to represent its text buffers.  In order to avoid having to
move text around in RAM after every character inserted, it maintains a
gap after the last character inserted; whenever a character is
inserted somewhere else, it moves the gap by copying text as necessary
from one end of it to the other.  It normally maintains only a single
gap, and it can be arbitrarily large, since it doesn’t need to worry
about keeping the two ends of the gap close enough together that you
can see them at the same time.</p>
<h2>Double-spaced text</h2>
<p>A disadvantage of all of the above approaches is that <em>any</em> text
insertion in the middle will involve <em>some</em> repainting of text in
order to open up a space for it.  The traditional typewriter-era
approach to this problem was to type the manuscript originally
“double-spaced”, with a blank line in between each pair of lines of
text, in order to allow sufficient space for markup to include text to
be added.  With this approach, the above-explained edit would
start looking like the following:</p>
<pre><code>text from the screen until you leave insert mode.  This reduces

repaint traffic considerably on terminals like the ADM-3A.



On an e-ink display, something like might be

useful, but we could carry it further.  For example, if you start
</code></pre>
<p>And the insertion might leave it looking like the following, with a
caret positioned below the insertion point and the inserted text
above:</p>
<pre><code>text from the screen until you leave insert mode.  This reduces

repaint traffic considerably on terminals like the ADM-3A.

</code></pre>
<p>This approach avoids any need to redisplay existing text to
accommodate small insertions.</p>
<p>Another approach along the same lines would be to pop up a speech
balloon or something over the existing text to contain the edit,
although this obscures some of the existing text.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>text from the screen until you leave insert mode.  This reduces
repaint traffic considerably on termi̲n̲a̲l̲s̲_l̲i̲k̲e̲_t̲h̲e̲_A̲D̲M̲-̲3̲A̲̲.̲_____

<p>For grayscale displays, it might help to make the popup balloon
translucent, display the text within in a larger size, and filter the
text to soften its edges, all with the intent of leaving the obscured
text readable.</p>
<h2>Cursor display and movement</h2>
<p>A separate problem is that the long display latency makes it hard to
tell what your cursor is pointing at when you’re moving it around in
text.  This is a problem I have a lot of experience with in vi, which
I used to use routinely over modem connections with tens of seconds of
latency, and I still use routinely over Tor connections with seconds
of latency.  vi was originally developed under conditions that often
included seconds of latency due to not only modem bandwidth but also
host machine load, and its command set copes well with this situation.</p>
<p>The basic problem is that, under these conditions, you can’t position
the cursor effectively using arrow keys (or vi’s hjkl), and you can’t
delete text with the backspace key, especially if you’re using key
repeat (“Typematic”, to use IBM’s trademark), because those depend on
closed-loop control.  The long and unpredictable latency in the
feedback control loop between your fingers and your eyes means that
you face a painful tradeoff between long settling times and overshoot:
if the cursor hasn’t reached the desired point and you press the arrow
key one more time, you may have caused it to move past the desired
point if you didn’t wait long enough.</p>
<p>The solution is to use movement commands that are <em>convergent</em> and at
a sufficiently <em>high level</em> to not depend on tight closed-loop
control.  “Convergent” means that commands cause similar editor states
to converge to a single editor state, so initial divergences between
the editor state and the user’s belief about it, due to the latency,
will not compound over time.  So, for example, the <code>{</code> command moves
back by a paragraph.  If you believe you’re on the third line of the
paragraph, but you’re actually on the line below the paragraph, it
will still take you to the same point before the beginning of the
paragraph, eliminating your error.  The Vim command <code>ci(</code> similarly
replaces the entire contents of the <code>()</code> parentheses you are within
with whatever you type next; it doesn’t matter if those parentheses
contained 20 or 25 characters, or whether you were on the first or
tenth character of the parenthesized expression, the same text gets
replaced either way.  At a more trivial level, the </p>
<p>These commands, unfortunately, impose a substantial cognitive load and
a great deal of practice to use effectively.  Jef Raskin’s design of
“LEAP”, a single quasimodal movement command, enjoys the advantages of
being strongly convergent and fairly high level, but with a much lower
cognitive load.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Briefly, LEAP is similar to the incremental-search found in Emacs
and Vim; Raskin’s Canon Cat keyboard has two LEAP keys to be pressed
with the thumbs, one on the left for searching backwards and one on
the right for searching forwards, which initiate the search when the
user begins pressing them and terminate it when the user releases
them.  In either case, the user is left at the beginning of the
matched text, rather than the end, so there is no penalty for typing
more characters than needed, and no special provision is needed for
special characters such as newlines.</p>
<p>Raskin claimed that in user tests LEAP was substantially faster than
using a mouse to navigate text.  I haven’t done the rigorous tests
he claims to, but from my experience, this claim seems plausible to
me.</p>
<p>The Cat had no ↑↓ keys, just ←→ “creep” keys and the LEAP keys, the
idea being that if the user was moving far enough to need ↑↓, they’d
be faster if they didn’t have the cognitive load of making a
decision between arrow keys and LEAP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E-ink latency is long, but it’s shorter than the kinds of latency vi
can cope with.  I think LEAP might be a good way to position a cursor
quickly on an e-ink display without needing to see the cursor in order
to know precisely where it was.</p>
<p>Deletion is more problematic, since LEAPing from one end to the other
of the text to delete is usually going to be far too much overhead.</p>
<p>I routinely use ^W in terminals and vim, and Alt-⇐ or Ctrl-⇐ in Emacs,
to delete the entire previous word; this is generally much more
efficient than deleting just the incorrect letters and retyping them,
and often more efficient than going back a word or two to insert a
corrected word.  It’s often easier just to retype the last few words.</p>
<h2>Explicit screen refreshes</h2>
<p>When I first used AutoCAD (2.14K+ADE), it was on an IBM PC-XT.  The XT
was capable of executing about 250,000 16-bit instructions per second,
with a 320×200 CGA graphics display and an 80×25 MDA text display side
by side.  Redrawing the entire contents of the CGA monitor from the
in-memory CAD drawing typically required a second or two.  Therefore,
it was undesirable to perform a redraw after every mouse movement, or
even after every new line or arc added to or removed from the drawing.
Consequently, AutoCAD on this platform would update the display with
an approximation of the change; rubberband lines and arcs for the
mouse were drawn with XOR so they could be quickly erased, newly drawn
lines would overwrite whatever other lines were on the display (even
if they were in a layer below them), and deletion of lines and arcs
was reflected by drawing them in the background color, leaving visible
holes at any intersection.  These operations could be done many times
per second, permitting a real-time interactive feel.</p>
<p>(A more difficult problem was choosing points on the screen with the
mouse, since the display resolution was insufficient to make anything
other than very crude drawings by eye.  Typically I would specify INT
or TAN or whatever on the keyboard, and then point with the mouse to
indicate the intersection of which things, or tangent to which arc; or
I would directly enter relative coordinates in polar or rectangular
form.)</p>
<p>When the damage to the drawing on the screen made it sufficiently
difficult to see what was going on, you would issue the REDRAW command
from the keyboard, which has the merit of being possible to type
without removing your right hand from the mouse.  There were other
operations that also required a redraw, notably zooming and panning
the drawing.</p>
<p>(This kind of pragmatic and very clever compromise was what made it
possible for Autodesk to sell a usable CAD system in the early 1980s
on hardware costing a tenth of what existing CAD systems cost.)</p>
<p>Since a screen refresh on the Ultimate Writer takes some 3000
milliseconds, it’s in the same ballpark as this PC-XT with AutoCAD, so
it might be worth using a similar approach to screen updating: do a
full-screen refresh only when the user requests it explicitly, or when
you’re displaying most of a screenful of new information.</p>
<p>Several of the choices suggested above include a non-WYSIWYG display
of edits: line-mode editing, strikethrough, speech balloons,
double-spaced interlineal markup, large insertion blanks, and so on.
The idea is that these reduce the visual feedback latency from the
3000 milliseconds NinjaTrappeur is suffering now <a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">to a mere 600 or
so</a>, so that you can reasonably do edits.  But it should be easy
for the user to request a WYSIWYG redisplay whenever they want to see
the final result of the edit and are willing to wait the requisite
seconds.</p>
