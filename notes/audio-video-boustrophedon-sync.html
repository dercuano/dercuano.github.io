(2 minutes)</div><p>If you’re trying to sync audio with video, for example because you
recorded them on different devices, you acquired them via different
sources (that don’t share a timebase), or you’re playing them back
through devices with different latencies, you traditionally need some
kind of interactive successive approximation where you twist some kind
of knob or something until you get it right.</p>
<p>A difficulty with this is that only occasionally are there events in
the video that you can associate with high precision with the audio.
So you have to wait for one of them to happen once for each
approximation.</p>
<p>The ideal solution is probably to find a short segment of video with
such an event and repeat it at as high a frequency as possible as you
adjust the audio–video lag.  Around 20 Hz, rhythms — pulse
trains — fade into continuous tones.  So you need something a little
slower than that, which possibly limits you to about 50 ms feedback
latency on the knob.  Also, you probably need several frames of video
to successfully interpolate movement, and video is commonly
interpolated at rates as low as 24 Hz, so you might not be able to do
better than, say, 6 Hz or 4 Hz for the repetition.</p>
<p>However, at these rates, the impulsive event you’re looking to
synchronize the sound with — ideally a clapboard, but often in
practice a spoken plosive or something — may be overwhelmed by the
much larger impulsive event of jumping back in time by 167 ms or 250
ms.  A possible solution is to play both the video and the audio
segment boustrophedonically: first forward, then backward, then
forward again, and so on.  This eliminates the first-order
discontinuities, though the remaining second-order
discontinuities — objects instantly reversing their direction of
motion — may be disturbing.</p>
<p>The knob should probably directly control the video displacement, not
the audio displacement, to avoid screwing with the pitch.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
