(15 minutes)</div><p>Programs compiled with Ur-Scheme are about five times slower than
similar programs compiled with GCC.  TCC is broadly similar.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that a big part of Ur-Scheme's slowness is probably
its complete lack of register allocation.  It treats the i386 as a stack
machine with the top of stack in %eax.  And so it occurred to me that
even the dumbest register allocator would probably provide a big
speedup, maybe up to a slowdown of less than 2.</p>
<p>What's the dumbest register allocator that might give you reasonable
performance?  Well, on amd64, as I understand it, you have 16
general-purpose registers, but one of them is the stack pointer.  You
could statically allocate 8 of these registers to local variables (the
first 8 local variables) and 7 of them to an expression evaluation stack
which is empty in between statements, assuming you have statements and
that control flow is a per-statement thing.  Then you can allocate the
slots on the expression evaluation stack at compile time and spill to
memory if your evaluation gets too deep.</p>
<p>I feel like that would probably work well enough, and it would be very
simple to implement.</p>
<p>On i386, you don't have as many registers.  You could have 4 levels of
expression evaluation and 3 local variables held in registers.</p>
<h2>Context: how well do programs get optimized?</h2>
<p>Here's a Karplus-Strong string synthesis program I wrote in C, something
over a year ago, in golfed form:</p>
<pre><code>enum{n=72};s[n]={1&lt;&lt;15},i;main(){void*o=popen("aplay","w");
for(i=0;i&lt;1&lt;&lt;14;i++)fputc((s[i%n]=s[i%n]*.9+s[(i+1)%n]*.1)&gt;&gt;8,o);}
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a deobfuscated version of the main loop:</p>
<pre><code>for (i=0; i &lt; 1&lt;&lt;14; i++) {
    int j = i % n, k = (i+1) % n;
    s[j] = s[j]*.9 + s[k]*.1;
    fputc(s[j] &gt;&gt; 8, output);
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>n</code> here is 72, and <code>s</code> starts out with just an impulse in it.  (If
you're not familiar with KS synthesis, the weighted averaging of two
samples there serves as a gentle low-pass IIR filter, attenuating all
frequencies but especially the highest frequencies, while feeding the
signal back into the delay line after 72 samples limits the original
harmonic content to harmonics of 8000 Hz / 72 = 111 Hz, and the result
sounds exactly like the string of a six-string guitar.)</p>
<p>I feel like this is a relatively typical piece of C code in some ways.
It has a for loop comparing against a constant expression that can be
folded, some array accesses and a function call inside the loop, some
floating point and integer math, some strength-reduction opportunities,
and a local variable (or two, although <code>i</code> is technically a global).</p>
<p>So how badly does TCC do on this program?</p>
<p>First, what's our gold standard?  It's actually pretty terrifying, both
in terms of the optimizations achieved and the optimizations missed.  On
i386, here's a commented disassembly of the 48 instructions gcc 4.8.4
emits for the main loop with -O:</p>
<pre><code> 804847d:   89 c6                   mov    %eax,%esi

 # This magic number is the approximate multiplicative inverse of
 # 72.  72 times this number is 0x10,0000,0008.  That means that if
 # you multiply some 32-bit integer X by 0x38e38e39, then the high
 # word of the 64-bit result will contain the number divided by 72,
 # shifted four bits to the left.  So, for example, 0x38e38e39L *
 # 146 &gt;&gt; 36 = 2L.  So we save it in %ebx so we can multiply by it
 # in order to divide.  Multiplying is usually much faster than

<p>All right, so we can see GCC missed a <em>lot</em> of optimization
opportunities there, although some of them were missed by the perverse
choice to make i a global variable.  But it did manage to compute i%72
without using any division instructions.  It also manages to keep j and
k in registers and avoid recomputing j --- common subexpression
elimination.  And the control flow is nice and clean, just a single
conditional jump instruction at the end, because it can statically check
that the loop will execute at least once.</p>
<p>How does TCC do?  It's a bit messier but somewhat more straightforward,
as you'd expect. tcc 0.9.25 emits 67 instructions:</p>
