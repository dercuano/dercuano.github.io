<p>Suppose that, like most days, we’re trying to find a local minimum of
a univariate function <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) we can automatically differentiate with
a continuous derivative.  By using affine arithmetic, we should be
able to get both quadratic convergence to the minimum, under
Newton–Raphson-like conditions, and a guarantee of global optimality.</p>
<h2>Newtonish–Raphsonish root finding with affine arithmetic</h2>
<p>Suppose that the derivative is continuous (though not necessarily
Lipschitz) and our automatic differentiation procedure supports
reduced affine arithmetic, so that we can evaluate the function’s
derivative <em>f'</em>(<em>x</em>) at “points” that are really affine forms
describing some interval [<em>x</em>₀, <em>x</em>₁], such as an interval with a zero
in it, and get back an affine form that gives a linear approximation
<em>k</em> + <em>a</em>₀<em>x</em> and a fairly tight worst-case error <em>a</em>₁ from that
approximation <em>x</em> ∈ [<em>x</em>₀, <em>x</em>₁] ⇒ ∃<em>ε</em> ∈ [-1, 1]: <em>f'</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>k</em> +
<em>a</em>₀<em>x</em> + <em>a</em>₁<em>ε</em>.  (Affine arithmetic is discussed at some length in
<a href="../notes/affine-database.html">An affine-arithmetic database index for rapid historical securities formula queries</a> and <a href="../notes/affine-arithmetic-optimization.html">Affine arithmetic optimization</a>.)</p>
<p>This allows us to bound the zero of the derivative, and thus the
critical point of <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>), to a generally much smaller interval: <em>x</em>
must be between -(<em>k</em> - <em>a</em>₁)/<em>a</em>₀ and -(<em>k</em> + <em>a</em>₁)/<em>a</em>₀.  In fact,
<em>every</em> zero of the derivative within the original interval is
guaranteed to be within that new interval, so in cases where the new
interval is larger or fails to be sufficiently smaller than the
original, we must be prepared instead to subdivide the interval and
recurse on each subinterval.</p>
<h3>Rate of convergence and global optimality</h3>
<p>I was thinking about trying to do a rigorous proof here but instead
I’m just going to handwave because it’s almost 4 AM.  Generally the
(vertical) error bounds affine arithmetic gives you are proportional
to the second derivative of the function you’re calculating (which is
itself a derivative in the above), unrelated to its first derivative,
and inversely proportional to the square of the interval width.  This
is pretty much the same situation as Newton–Raphson iteration or the
method of secants, so you should expect it to converge quadratically
under the same conditions that they do.</p>
<p>If you can figure out how to make an initial interval that is big
enough to contain all the local optima, then this approach is
guaranteed to find all the local optima and in fact all the critical
points; you can use branch-and-bound to avoid recursing too deeply in
areas where the local optima are not as good as the worst case in
other areas where you are also searching, so even functions with a
large number of critical points may be tractable.</p>
<h2>Indirect multidimensional optimization, and root-finding in general</h2>
<p>This can, of course, be used to find zeroes of functions that aren’t
derivatives of anything of special interest, and I think that’s where
I got the idea — from people using this approach for raytracing of
implicit surfaces, specifically Gamito and Maddock’s paper from 2004
or 2005, “Ray Casting Implicit Fractal Surfaces with Reduced Affine
Arithmetic”, §4.3, p. 6, fig. 2.  But it seems like an approach that could be
extremely fruitful for mathematical optimization.  In <a href="../notes/adaptive-hill-climbing.html">Robust local search in vector spaces using adaptive step sizes, and thoughts on extending quasi-Newton methods</a> I suggested cutting a multidimensional
function along a gradient line to get a one-dimensional function
that’s easier to optimize, an approach I haven’t tried yet, but it
seems like this approach would work for it.</p>
<h2>Direct multidimensional optimization</h2>
<p>Alternatively, it might be feasible to use this approach more directly
for multidimensional optimization.  There’s a paper out a few years
back about a correct algorithm using interval arithmetic for
multidimensional optimization, using a branch-and-bound approach, but
as I understand it, it has the problem that it is very slow on
high-dimensional spaces.  Suppose you look for a zero of some gradient
<em>g⃗</em> as Σ<em>ᵢgᵢ</em>² or Σ<em>ᵢ</em>|<em>gᵢ</em>| using a variant of the method above,
using reduced affine arithmetic to compute bounds on this (squared)
gradient magnitude or other gradient norm over some multidimensional
box; I think this should take time merely proportional to the
dimensionality.</p>
<p>The magnitudes of the coefficients in the resulting affine form should
tell you how sensitive the gradient is to your location within the box
along each dimension; to some extent you can trade off shrinking the
box along one dimension against shrinking it along another dimension,
but it’s hard to know which dimension is optimal to shrink most in.</p>
<p>Maybe if we automatically differentiate our reduced-affine-arithmetic
program, we can get the gradient of the error bars on the (original
function’s) gradient norm, with respect to the bounds of the box we’re
evaluating the gradient over.  This would tell us which dimensions of
the box are most important to shrink in order to reduce the
uncertainty in the gradient.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
