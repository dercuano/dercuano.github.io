<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method">method of secants</a> is an algorithm the humans have been using for some
3000 years to solve a fairly wide variety of inverse problems, or, to
their modern way of thinking, find zeroes of a fairly large class of
functions.  Given a function <em>f</em> from some vector <em>x</em> to the
underlying field of that vector, such as ℂ or ℝ, we compute a sequence
of iterative approximations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>xₙ</em> = <em>xₙ</em>₋₁ - <em>f</em>(<em>xₙ</em>₋₁) · (<em>xₙ</em>₋₁ - <em>xₙ</em>₋₂) / (<em>f</em>(<em>xₙ</em>₋₁) - <em>f</em>(<em>xₙ</em>₋₂))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can think of this as a variant of Newton–Raphson iteration, using
the secant approximation to the tangent line.</p>
<p>Unlike Newton–Raphson iteration, it doesn’t require computing the
derivative of the function, and it has slightly faster convergence
under the usual assumptions used to prove the convergence of
Newton–Raphson iteration — under those circumstances, the error after
each iteration is the previous error to the power φ ≈ 1.618, but each
iteration only requires computing a single new value of the function
being solved for, while Newton–Raphson iteration requires computing a
new value of the function and also of its derivative, which is usually
about twice as much work.  So in some sense it converges about 31%
faster.</p>
<p>However, it needs two guesses to get started instead of one, which
makes its convergence conditions somewhat more complicated to
describe.</p>
<p>Some ideas occurred to me about how to use the method of secants, so I
thought I’d write them down.</p>
<p>I used the method of secants as an extended example in <a href="../notes/implementation-separation.html">Separating implementation, optimization, and proofs</a>.</p>
<p>(This is probably crushingly naïve compared to all the work out there
on optimization methods I don’t understand yet, like Nelder–Mead,
Broyden’s method, and the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, not to
mention the stunning successes in recent years with variants of
gradient descent; but I thought it would be worth writing down.)</p>

something you don’t want to do while blaming someone else.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Vector-domain functions</h2>
<p>The method of secants is normally described as a one-dimensional
root-finding method, but above, I said that you can generalize the
domain of the function to be a vector, as suggested by the form of its
recurrence relation.  What happens in practice if you try that?</p>
<p>Consider <em>f</em> : ℝ² → ℝ = λ(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>).<em>a</em>² + <em>b</em>² - 1, a paraboloid
which is zero everywhere along the unit circle.  If our initial
starting guesses are <em>x</em>₀ = (1, 1) and <em>x</em>₁ = (2, 0), the values just
sort of randomly oscillate:</p>
<ul>
<li>1, 1</li>
<li>2,  0</li>
<li>0.5,  1.5</li>
<li>-1,  3</li>
<li>0.8,  1.2</li>
<li>1.04545455,  0.95454545</li>
<li>4.29411765, -2.29411765</li>
<li>0.89511609,  1.10488391</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s because each <em>x</em> value in the method of secants is an affine
combination of the previous two values, so there’s no way for them to
get off the line <em>b</em> = 2 - <em>a</em>; and, as it happens, that line doesn’t
intersect the unit circle.  If you’re looking for an intersection of
that line with the circle, or more likely some hairy implicit
function, that might be great — although, if there are multiple
intersections, there’s no guarantee about which one you’ll get, unlike
with signed-distance-function raytracing.  But if you’re trying to
find <em>any</em> solution, it’s not so great that you need to start by
picking two points that are collinear with it.</p>
<p>Other pairs of starting points converge just fine for the same
function:</p>
<ul>
<li>1, 0.5</li>
<li>2, 0</li>
<li>0.90909091,  0.54545455</li>
<li>0.86206897,  0.56896552</li>
<li>0.80697224,  0.59651388</li>
<li>0.80049797,  0.59975101</li>
<li>0.80000430,  0.59999785</li>
<li>0.8,  0.6</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different approaches to solving this problem.  Perhaps the
simplest possible one is to use a secant, not through the last two
points, but through the first and last of the last <em>m</em> points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>xₙ</em> = <em>xₙ</em>₋₁ - <em>f</em>(<em>xₙ</em>₋₁) · (<em>xₙ</em>₋₁ - <em>xₙ</em>₋<em>ₘ</em>) / (<em>f</em>(<em>xₙ</em>₋₁) - <em>f</em>(<em>xₙ</em>₋<em>ₘ</em>))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In theory this should allow the last <em>m</em> points to be a simplex of an
<em>m</em>-1-dimensional space, so their affine combinations would be that
<em>m</em>-1-dimensional space, at the expense of somewhat slower
convergence.  This seems too dumb to work, but it does seem to.
Here’s a Python implementation:</p>
<pre><code>def secnd_seq(f, x):
    x = list(x)
    y = [f(xi) for xi in x]

    while True:
        yield x[-1], y[-1]

        div = y[-1] - y[0]
        if not div:
            return

        x.append(x[-1] - y[-1] * (x[-1] - x[0]) / div)
        y.append(f(x[-1]))
        x.pop(0)
        y.pop(0)
</code></pre>
<p>Given random points from [-5, 5]², this converges to a point on the
unit circle about ¼ of the time with 2 starting points (the orthodox
method of secants), but almost always with 3 or more starting points,
because three points is enough to span the whole 2-D parameter space
almost surely.  However, the algorithm frequently takes several
thousand iterations to converge!  Increasing the number of starting
points to 4, 5, or 6 makes it less frequently need more than 100
iterations or more than 1000 iterations, but since it usually
converges in less than 50 iterations with 3 points, it might make just
as much sense to do a random restart if the algorithm is failing to
converge.  Still, increasing the number of points more makes the
completion time more consistent.</p>
<pre><code>unit_circle = lambda (x, y): x**2 + y**2 - 1

def test_nd(d=3, n=1000, maxiter=100, eps=1e-15, f=unit_circle):
    ok = not_ok = 0

    for i in range(n):
        x = [numpy.random.random(2) * 10 - 5 for j in range(d)]
        items = list(itertools.islice(secnd_seq(f, x), maxiter))
        if abs(items[-1][-1]) &lt; eps:
            print "ok:", x, items[-1][0], len(items)
            ok += 1
        else:
            print "not ok", x, items[-d:]
            not_ok += 1

    return ok, not_ok
</code></pre>
<p>(After several thousand trials, it did find a three-starting-point
state from which convergence failed after 10000 iterations: three
points reported as [array([-2.57650664, -4.90971528]),
array([-0.17240513, -3.30215595]), array([-4.9655625 , 3.50688737])].
Unfortunately, that point converges in 82 iterations; like Lorentz’s,
my attempt at reproducibility has apparently been defeated by
rounding.)</p>
<p>This experimental result suggests that this approach may be usable in
high-dimensionality spaces to find zeroes, perhaps, like gradient
descent is for finding minima.  But I wonder how it compares to
running gradient descent, or one of its modern variants like AdaGrad
or Adam, on the square of a function?</p>
<h2>Finding a zero of a vector-valued function</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to find an intersection (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) of two circles:
(<em>x</em> - <em>x</em>₀)² + (<em>y</em> - <em>y</em>₀)² - <em>r</em>₀² = 0 ∧ (<em>x</em> - <em>x</em>₁)² + (<em>y</em> -
<em>y</em>₁)² - <em>r</em>₁² = 0.  You could think of this as finding a zero of a
vector-valued function <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) : ℝ² → ℝ² = ((<em>x</em> - <em>x</em>₀)² + (<em>y</em>
- <em>y</em>₀)² - <em>r</em>₀², (<em>x</em> - <em>x</em>₁)² + (<em>y</em> - <em>y</em>₁)² - <em>r</em>₁²).  But we
can’t directly apply the method of secants, because we need to divide
by the difference of two function outputs, and you can’t divide
vectors.</p>
<p>However, we can take a norm of the result vector to get a scalar which
will only be 0 when the vector is 0; for example, the <strong>L₁</strong> norm:
|(<em>x</em> - <em>x</em>₀)² + (<em>y</em> - <em>y</em>₀)² - <em>r</em>₀²| + |(<em>x</em> - <em>x</em>₁)² + (<em>y</em> -
<em>y</em>₁)² - <em>r</em>₁²|.  Or, in Python:</p>
<pre><code>def circle_intersection(x0, y0, r0, x1, y1, r1):
    def f(xv):
        x, y = xv
        return (abs((x - x0)**2 + (y - y0)**2 - r0**2) +
                abs((x - x1)**2 + (y - y1)**2 - r1**2))

    return f
</code></pre>
<p>This of course has a discontinuous derivative whenever we cross one of
the circles, and so although the procedure above is able to find
intersections successfully, it takes several hundred iterations to do
so.  But, surprisingly, things get even worse if we try to use the
<strong>L₂</strong> norm:</p>
<pre><code>def circle_intersection_L2(x0, y0, r0, x1, y1, r1):
    def f(xv):
        x, y = xv
        return (((x - x0)**2 + (y - y0)**2 - r0**2)**2 +
                ((x - x1)**2 + (y - y1)**2 - r1**2)**2)

    return f
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is because the quadratic convergence condition of both
Newton–Raphson iteration and the method of secants requires the
function to have a nonzero derivative in the neighborhood of its root,
and the <strong>L₂</strong> norm instead has a zero derivative.  Still, by using
enough initial points, we can usually get to the solutions this way;
this converges on 997 out of 1000 attempts, but usually takes between
1000 and 2000 iterations:</p>
<pre><code>test_nd(d=20, maxiter=10000,
        f=circle_intersection_L2(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1),
        eps=1e-13)
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>L<sup>∞</sup></strong> norm is just as bad.</p>
<h2>Optimization</h2>
<p>Thomas Simpson pointed out that, if you can compute the first and
second derivatives of a function, you can use Newton–Raphson iteration
to numerically approximate its critical points — saddle points, local
minima, and local maxima.  Its global minimum must be one of these or,
if its domain is compact, a point on the boundary of the domain.  (If
its domain is finite and open it may not have a minimum, just an
infimum.)  In low dimensionalities with sufficiently polite functions,
this can enable you to quickly find the global minimum, even by manual
computation.  This approach has expanded into a whole field of
“quasi-Newton methods”, but these involve maintaining an approximation
of the Hessian matrix of the function being optimized — and in <em>n</em>
dimensions, the Hessian has <em>n</em>² elements.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can use the method of secants to numerically
approximate a critical point of a function if you can compute the
function’s derivative — for example, using automatic differentiation.
Earlier, I suggested that maybe you could square a function, at least
a real one, and use generic optimization algorithms to find its
zeroes.  Now I’m suggesting almost the opposite: differentiate a
function and use generic root-finding algorithms to find the zeroes of
its derivative, then test them to see which one is lowest.</p>
<p>If we are attempting to find a minimum of a function <em>f</em> : ℝ<em>ⁿ</em> → ℝ,
we can start by using automatic differentiation to compute points of
∇<em>f</em>, which are in ℝ<em>ⁿ</em>.  Then we can, perhaps, use the extended
method of secants in the way described above — taking some norm of
that gradient and attempting to extrapolate to where it becomes zero,
using something like 2<em>n</em> or 3<em>n</em> points — with only on the order of
3<em>n</em> + O(1) operations per iteration, rather than the O(<em>n</em>²) required
by quasi-Newton methods.  (However, I suspect that convergence, if it
happens at all, may be slower per iteration with this approach, so
overall it may be faster or slower than quasi-Newton methods.)</p>
<h2>Genetic algorithms</h2>
<p>“Genetic algorithms” is a catchy name for a popular metaheuristic
based on Darwinian and Mendelian metaphors.  You have a “population”
of “chromosomes” over which you compute “fitnesses”; then, to create a
new “generation”, you “crossbreed” members of the population chosen
randomly (with higher probability increasing with fitness) by
combining their “genes” with “crossover” and apply “mutations” to the
results.  As long as the crossover and mutation operations aren’t too
destructive to fitness, each generation of the population will tend to
have higher and higher “fitness”.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that the method of secants sort of fits into this
mold, but with an especially powerful “crossover” mechanism — it
attempts to extrapolate from the differences between the two “genomes”
it’s crossbreeding to find the optimum.  The offspring is necessarily
within the space of affine combinations of the two parents, but its
fitness may be much higher than theirs.  (But sometimes it’s not.)</p>
<p>The above approach of just drawing secants from further back in the
history of approximations, in order to handle higher dimensionality,
can be seen as a sort of degenerate genetic algorithm in which we only
crossbreed two individuals at a time, and they’re always the oldest
and youngest.  Presumably more judicious choice of parents would yield
faster convergence.</p>
<p>As an example, I was thinking of approximating an image (see <a href="../notes/image-approximation.html">Image approximation</a>) with a set of Lambertian spheres of the same
color and some lighting, and using the method of secants as above to
generate new combinations of spheres.  The function being optimized
would be a combination of the difference between an image rendered
from a given configuration of spheres and a penalty for the complexity
of the configuration; the configuration would consist of an (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>,
<em>z</em>) direction for the directional light, an (<em>r</em>, <em>g</em>, <em>b</em>) color for
the ambient light, and parameters (<em>xᵢ</em>, <em>yᵢ</em>, <em>zᵢ</em>, <em>Rᵢ</em>, <em>rᵢ</em>, <em>gᵢ</em>,
<em>bᵢ</em>) for each sphere in the configuration.  Mutation operations would
add noise to everything and occasionally clone a sphere.  Initial
renderings would be low in resolution to speed up the initial search.</p>
<p>Dunno, maybe something like that could work for the
structure-from-shading or even structure-from-motion problem, though
in the second case you additionally have to estimate the camera path
relative to the object.  And maybe gradient descent and its variants
are better fits.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
