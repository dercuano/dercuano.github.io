(4 minutes)</div><p>Suppose your codeword is a common-time measure; the symbols available
for use within it are a quarter-note, two eighth notes, and a rest;
you’re using two pitches simultaneously, separated by a perfect fifth;
the first beat, for timing, cannot be two rests or two eighth notes,
nor can the second beat be two rests; and if only one of the pitches
appears in the measure, it must be the low one (since without hearing
the other one, it’s hard to guess whether it’s meant to be the low one
or the high one).  How many possible codewords do you have?</p>
<p>Well, a normal beat (the third or fourth) has 9 possibilities
available.  The first beat can be 7 of those 9 possibilities, and the
second can be 8 of them.  That gives us 7·8·9·9 = 4536 possibilities,
but of these, a few have only rests at the lower pitch: 2·2·3·3 = 36.
So the total number of these very simple biphonic melodies is 4500, so
each one can encode just over 12 bits, which is roughly a single
English word, depending on how sophisticated a model you use to
measure the entropy.</p>
<p>I chose a perfect fifth because, although the two pitches are
assonant, their harmonics will be largely distinct, potentially
enabling decoding even if large swaths of the spectrum are lost.  The
fundamentals of the two of them are the second and third harmonic of a
fundamental an octave below the lower pitch, and so the
divisible-by-three harmonics of the low note will be the even
harmonics of the high note.  This means that half of the harmonics of
the high note will not be found in the low note’s harmonics, and two
thirds of the low note’s harmonics will not be found in the harmonics
of the high note.</p>
<p>If, for example, we choose 220Hz (A, I don't know, is that A below
middle C?) for the low note, then 330Hz (E?) will be the high note.
The 220Hz note has about 68 harmonics in the easily-human-audible
range, of which 46 are not among the harmonics of E; and E has 46
harmonics in the easily-human-audible range, of which 23 are not among
the harmonics of A.  You should be able to distinguish between these
notes by finding the 9.09ms-lag autocorrelation peak and comparing it
to the 4.55ms-lag one and the 3.03ms-lag one (they should be higher if
there is a note there and lower if there isn’t?), and that should work
even if big parts of the spectrum (including the fundamentals) are
strongly suppressed.  And you should be able to find the note onset by
differentiating these autocorrelations over time.</p>
<p>If you play the melody at 180bpm, which is pretty durn fast for music,
you will get through one measure every 1333ms, for a total of 9 bits
per second.  This is slower than people talk, so people might be able
to learn it.  Your eighth notes will run for 167ms each, which is
about 37 cycles of A’s fundamental, which is plenty.</p>
<p>A 30ms window is 1323 samples at 44.1kHz, and brute-forcing its ACF is
thus about 0.9 million multiplications, which seems like a lot.  A
1024-sample Fourier transform should be something like 0.02 million,
and you can derive the ACF by DFT | take magnitude | DFT.  But if
you’re only looking to compare autocorrelation at three particular
lags, you can do that much more simply, with only three
multiply-accumulates per sample and without explicit windowing.</p>
<p>(A thought here for pitch tracking: if you’re trying to track a
changing pitch using autocorrelation, maybe you could hill-climbingly
adjust a pair of lags bracketing the true frequency, like nostrils,
and get by with only two multiply-accumulates per sample?  That's
maybe cheaper even than the Goertzel algorithm or a software PLL,
although it does require a multiply.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
