(4 minutes)</div><p>Okay, I can’t find my previous notes on frequency identification, but
here’s what I came up with tonight, which I’m pretty sure is good.
You get two booleans by comparing the current sample to 0 and to the
simple moving average (or maybe double simple moving average) of the
last N samples, getting a kind of estimate of its derivative.  These
two booleans give you a quadrature rotation signal: 00, 01, 11, 10,
repeat.  The timing of the (corresponding forward) transitions of this
signal is ¼ the period of the input signal.  You get the transition
immediately at the sample, with no codec or processing latency the way
an STFT has, and fairly little computation per sample:</p>
<pre><code>// Advance ring buffer sample pointer
xj = &amp;x[j++];
if (j == n) j = 0;
// Update ring buffer x and moving average numerator m
m -= *xj;
*xj = xi;
m += xi;
// Compute new quadrature state.
s = (xi &gt; 0) &lt;&lt; 1 | (xi * n &gt; m);
if (s != os) transition(t[os &lt;&lt; 2 | s]);
os = s;
</code></pre>
<p>So in the usual case, that works out to an increment, an indexed
address computation, four comparisons, a memory fetch, a subtraction,
a memory store, an addition, a multiplication by constant N, a bit
shift, a bitwise or, and a state variable update which could be
eliminated by unrolling the loop once: 14 operations per sample, all
very simple except possibly the constant multiplication.  In the case
of a detected transition, you get a bitshift by two, an or, and a
table lookup.</p>
<p>All of this is LTI up to the last bit where we take the signs and look
stuff up in a transition table.</p>
<p>The FIR frontend is a very chintzy bandpass filter: the (implicit)
subtraction from the current sample attenuates low frequencies, while
the moving average itself attenuates high frequencies, but can only
manage about 3dB of attenuation on the overall transfer function
because of the impulse at lag 0.  An additional moving-average pass (6
more operations, including the memory references and wrap) cleans up
the high-frequency part of the response.  We could make it a somewhat
better bandpass filter, at the expense of fractional cycles of
response latency, by using something else than the current sample:
another simple moving average, which of course suggests that maybe we
should use two moving averages of the same size, abutting but not
overlapping, thus removing the multiplication as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting, though, is to use several moving-average
filters of different sizes, which, if they are single-stage, can use
just one single buffer of input data.  If their sizes are powers of 2,
you can rescale the sums for the subtraction just by a bit shift of 1.
In the limit, this takes the same 14 operations per sample per octave,
but gets you much better low-pass filtering.  Each filter will detect
a separate frequency, which may or may not be the dominant frequency
in its octave.</p>
<p>You could try to track the phase of the signal more closely than just
within 90°, and this may be useful.  However, the moving-average
filter that provides the "derivative" signal imposes a somewhat
arbitrary attenuation, which means that your phase velocity will vary
throughout a cycle, perhaps wildly.  However, the lag between crossing
a given phase angle on successive cycles should be consistent.</p>
<p>Median filtering, PLLs, blah.  Everybody uses variants of
autocorrelation (ASDF and AMDF).</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
