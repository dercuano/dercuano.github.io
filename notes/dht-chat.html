<p>I think you can build a DHT bulletin board system duplicating the
functionality of Usenet fairly simply.</p>
<h2>Usenet</h2>
<p>Usenet, a peer-to-peer communications system started in 1980, provides
a bulletin-board or threaded-discussion system. It consists or
consisted of a bunch of “articles”, each of which was identified by a
“message-ID”, categorized in one or more “newsgroups”, and
“referenced” zero or more articles that it was a “follow-up” to,
typically the transitive closure of the “references” relation on the
article it was replying to, with the ID of the message being replied
to last.  Typically, a Usenet news server would provide access to
articles recently posted to some finite set of newsgroups, replicated
to other news servers using gossip.</p>
<p>Typically, Usenet newsreaders would display a tree of the followup
relation while displaying the body of a single article, which would
often include pieces of other articles it was commenting on.  JWZ
devised the <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html">standard algorithm</a> for deriving the tree from the
“references” headers.  Experimental visualizations such as Yee’s
<a href="http://zesty.ca/threadmap/">threadmap</a> (<a href="http://zesty.ca/pubs/yee-threadmap-chi2005-workshop.pdf">paper</a>) have been tried, echoing the
two-dimensional hypertext layout used in the <a href="http://www.mesacc.edu/~thoqh49081/handouts/talmudpage.html">Talmud</a> for
millennia.</p>
<p>I’m speaking in the past tense here because Usenet has largely
succumbed to spam; the gossip protocol’s lack of scalability and the
needs of spam filtering resulted in a progressive centralization of
Usenet servers; and web-based systems have largely supplanted it for
day-to-day discussion.</p>
<p>Making message-IDs unique was always a bit of a challenge, in
particular since the gossip protocol in NNTP used message-IDs to
determine whether it already had an article, so you could halt the
spread of an undesirable message by posting a competing article with
the same message-ID, if you got wind of it soon enough.  Modern
peer-to-peer systems like BitTorrent, Git, Bitcoin, and Tahoe-LAFS
usually use self-certifying names (such as secure hashes of documents
or of public keys) in order to avoid such collisions.</p>
<h2>System design</h2>
<p>The system consists of a DHT storage system for immutable data and
feeds for mutable data.</p>
<h3>The DHT, storage, messages, and newsgroups</h3>
<p>The system’s immutable data is stored, potentially permanently, in a
DHT on the internet; the DHT’s basic interface consists of <code>key =
PUT(data)</code> and <code>data = GET(key)</code>.  The <code>key</code> is a 192-bit unique ID,
which is 24 bytes in binary or 32 bytes in base64, such as
“oruMktRkd127bWh6av4tXhJXiEscirL/” or
“SUrY99PC96aUjJttKFjmvWTFFqkNXmt1”; it consists of a randomly
generated 96-bit symmetric encryption key to use to decrypt the
article with an authenticated mode such as GCM, and a 96-bit secure
hash of the encrypted data chunk (for example, the first 96 bits of
SHA-256).  Only the secure hash is sent over the network to the DHT
storage nodes in the GET operation.</p>
<p>The DHT is only able to store fairly small chunks of data, up to 16
kibibytes or so, so a single article may be split across many DHT
chunks.  One of these chunks is the “root chunk” of the article, whose
key is the message-ID, containing the following data, together with
its typical sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>an “in-reply-to” field, with the message-IDs of zero or more
  articles to which it is a followup (24 bytes);</li>
<li>optionally, a “supersedes” field, with the message-ID of a article
  that this one is intended to replace, which must be signed by one of
  the same authors (24 bytes);</li>
<li>zero or more signatures identifying the authors of the article (64
  bytes), who may be bitcoins;</li>
<li>other human-useful metadata such as the subject/title, timestamp,
  byte count, and tags (128 bytes);</li>
<li>the key to the root block of a Merkle hash tree containing the
  article contents, including possibly other metadata (24 bytes).
  Typically this tree will contain a single node, which is the body
  itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a total of about 264 bytes, and it’s roughly what a Usenet
“overviews” entry would contain for the article.</p>
<p>The Merkle hash tree in this case is made out of 192-bit keys, so it
can support about 682-way branching; a single level of branching gets
you to message bodies of 11 megabytes, two levels of branching get you
to message bodies of 7.6 gigabytes, and three levels get you to 12.7
terabytes.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of “newsgroups” in this system: an “unmoderated
newsgroup” consisting of a tag query over whatever articles you happen
to know about, and a “moderated newsgroup” which is a special message
content-type containing the concatenation of many message-IDs, each
with the “root chunk” of the message appended to it in encrypted form,
just as the DHT node would send it to you, so that you don’t have to
query the DHT to get each message’s overview.</p>
<p>With this structure, a moderated newsgroup with a history of 100 000
messages would be a message of about 26 megabytes.  New versions of
the newsgroup, as long as the moderator doesn’t reorder the overviews
of the existing messages, will generally only alter the last chunk in
the Merkle tree — so you can update your view of the moderated
newsgroup by downloading only the root chunk, two levels of branching
chunks, and the newly-updated chunk.  (At the cost of revealing,
perhaps, how much of the newsgroup you had before.)</p>
<h4>Purging/expiry</h4>
<p>DHT nodes need to adopt some policy for purging data that nobody will
ever query once their storage media begin to get full; otherwise, it
will become impossible to post new articles, and this could even be
carried out as a denial-of-service attack by a .  Inevitably, the system as
a whole will expire data as old DHT nodes go offline forever and new
ones replace them.  (Unless the system is, at the time, dying, like
Usenet.)  So all of the data that ought to be preserved, in anybody’s
opinion, has to get “refreshed” by being stored again in the DHT, at
intervals.</p>
<h3>Feeds</h3>
<p>None of the above allows you to go from old data to new data, because
old data can only contain the keys of older data.  uery</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
