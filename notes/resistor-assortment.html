(4 minutes)</div><p>The electronics shop around the corner from GM Electronics sells
resistors in quantity 10 and up, for AR$8.
<a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stackpole-electronics-inc/CF14JT10K0/CF14JT10K0CT-ND/1830374">https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stackpole-electronics-inc/CF14JT10K0/CF14JT10K0CT-ND/1830374</a>
is a typical resistor: a 10kΩ ¼W 5% axial through-hole resistor.  Its
price is 10¢ in quantity 1, 4¢ in quantity 10, down to 0.7¢ in
quantity 1000 (US$7 for the 1000).</p>
<p>40¢ is AR$10, so AR$8 is a reasonable price in quantity 10, slightly
cheaper than Digi-Key actually.</p>
<p>I think I should ask for:</p>
<pre><code>10 1Ω   $8
10 2.2Ω $8
10 4.7Ω $8
10 10Ω  $8
10 22Ω  $8
10 47Ω  $8
10 100Ω $8
10 220Ω $8
10 470Ω $8
10 1kΩ  $8
10 2.2kΩ $8
10 4.7kΩ $8
10 10kΩ  $8
10 22kΩ  $8
10 47kΩ  $8
10 100kΩ $8
10 220kΩ $8
10 470kΩ $8
10 1MΩ   $8
10 2.2MΩ $8
10 4.7MΩ $8
10 10MΩ  $8
</code></pre>
<p>That’s 22 separate values, totaling AR$176.</p>
<p>I should probably also include some other basic components: opamps,
microcontrollers, voltage regulators, capacitors, transistors.</p>
<p>Opamps: the most popular opamps on Digi-Key are the TI TSV321RILT
(US$0.58), the TI LM2904DR (US$0.39), and the TI TL072CDR (US$0.62).
I don’t recognize any of those names.  The most popular non-TI opamp
is the ST LMV321ILT (US$0.51), which I assume is a TI LM321 clone.  So
maybe I should ask for an LM321 and expect to pay AR$15 for it.  The
LM741 is the one Electrocomponentes says is standard.</p>
<p>Digi-Key’s most popular μC is STILL a PIC12, a 74¢ one.  But the top
three PIC12s are followed by a $4.34 Cypress CY8C4245AXI-483, whatever
the fuck that is (apparently a Cortex-M0), then an $3.56 STM32 (also a
M0), and then finally a $12.35 ATMega2560.  All the cheapest μCs are
AVRs, though — an ATTiny5 for US$0.17, an ATTiny102 for US$0.30, an
ATTiny10 for US$0.34.  So if I don’t want to hassle with PICs, I
should probably ask for AVRs.  Electrocomponentes does have ATTiny11s,
13s, 2313s, and ATMega32s (which I guess are ATMega328s).  ATtiny13s
cost US$0.40 at Digi-Key.</p>
<p>Voltage regulators: probably I want programmable ones, plus maybe some
7805s.  The top pick among linear regulators is the US$0.72 LM317 with
350k in stock.  Even more popular among switchers is the US$0.70
EZBuck AOZ1280CI from a company I’ve never heard of.  No boost
regulators seem to be super popular.</p>
<p>Capacitors: I should probably get a bunch of 0.1μF ceramic bypass
caps.  These seem to cost about 10¢ apiece in quantity 10 and 5¢
apiece in quantity 100.</p>
<p>For MOSFETs, I should probably get some 2N7000s or similar.  These
seem to cost about US$0.51 in quantity 1 (9.4¢ in quantity 1000), and
they’re good to 60V, 115mA.  Also, for higher power, maybe some
IRF530s (100V) and IRF630s (200V) and their P-channel partners IRF9530
and IRF9630.</p>
<p>For BJTs, the most popular and cheapest are currently apparently
something called an MMBT3904, a 10¢ part good to 40V, 200 mA, with a
PNP counterpart called the MMBT3906 or PMBT3906.  An order of
magnitude faster are the 47¢ Rohm 2SC5662T2LPs, with fT of 3.2 GHz,
good to 11V, 50 mA.  There are also the 12¢ BC846 and BC849, NPN 65V
and 30V 100mA transistors, and their PNP counterparts the BC858 and
BC856, more or less; but these are only good to 100MHz.  The
traditional BJT is I think the 2N3904 (200 mA, 40V) and its PNP
partner the 2N3906.</p>
<p>Oh, I guess I should get some diodes: 1N4007 (the big 1N4001) and
1N4148 at least, and maybe some Schottky 1N5819s.  Maybe 100 of each.
Maybe not from the place that doesn’t guarantee their semiconductors
though.</p>
<p>Connectors for wires are called “borneras”; for pins are “conectores”.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
