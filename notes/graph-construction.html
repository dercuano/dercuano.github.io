<p>I think I have a new approach to concisely and responsively describing
directed graph structures that is useful in many different creative
endeavors that can be undertaken with computers.  I don’t yet have a
working implementation; this article is only an exploration.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of different possible notations for edge-labeled
directed graphs (and related structures), including some new
applications.</p>
<p>As an example application, in one variant of the notation, this is a
schematic for an energy-harvesting power supply circuit taken from a
paper on the subject.  Here <code>,</code> represents parallel connection,
concatenation represents serial connection, and <code>&lt;&gt;</code> represents
reversal, among other things:</p>
<pre><code>{{&lt;d&gt; {{ac i, c}}=q &lt;d&gt;, {&lt;d&gt; q &lt;d&gt;, c}} s {&lt;d&gt;, l {c, {&lt;v&gt;, r} r}}}
</code></pre>
<p>However, this approach is not limited to circuit design.  All of the
following can be conveniently represented as edge-labeled directed
graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular expressions</li>
<li>finite state machines</li>
<li>bubble-and-arrow diagrams (although the bubbles are more commonly
  labeled than the edges)</li>
<li>database queries</li>
<li>database contents</li>
<li>dataflow pipelines (or more generally dataflow graphs)</li>
<li>circuit schematics</li>
<li>control-flow graphs in programs</li>
<li>networks of constraints</li>
</ul>
<p>These techniques should be applicable to user interaction and
generative programming in all of these areas.</p>
<h2>Netlists</h2>
<p>You can write these things as netlists or 3-tuples; an abbreviated
example of a bubble-and-arrow diagram from the dot man page:</p>
<pre><code>   digraph test123 {
           a -&gt; z [label="hi", weight=100];
           x -&gt; z [label="multi-line\nlabel"];
           b -&gt; x;
   }
</code></pre>
<p>Or, here’s a circuit netlist <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/reference/chpt-7/example-circuits-and-netlists/">in Spice</a>:</p>
<pre><code>Multiple dc sources
v1 1 0 dc 24
v2 3 0 dc 15
r1 1 2 10k
r2 2 3 8.1k
r3 2 0 4.7k
.end
</code></pre>
<p>This requires naming every node; the nodes are named <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>x</code>,
and <code>z</code> in the dot example, and 0, 1, 2, and 3 in the Spice example.</p>
<p>Here’s a dataflow example <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse378/03wi/lectures/mips-asm-examples.html">by zahorjan@cs.washington.edu</a> in MIPS
assembly, which is at the same level of abstraction, although it
reuses the “dataflow node labels” $t0 and $t1 — each time they are the
first operand of an instruction, their previous value is overwritten:</p>
<pre><code>srl    $t0, $t0, 1       # i/2
addi   $t1, $gp, 28      # &amp;A[0]
sll    $t0, $t0, 2       # turn i/2 into a byte offset (*4)
add    $t1, $t1, $t0     # &amp;A[i/2]
</code></pre>
<p>If we were to rewrite that with SSA-style subscripts (what Ada
Lovelace use prefixed superscripts for) we get:</p>
<pre><code>srl    $t0₁, $t0₀, 1
addi   $t1₀, $gp₀, 28
sll    $t0₂, $t0₁, 2
add    $t1₁, $t1₀, $t0₂
</code></pre>
<p>There are better alternatives, though.</p>
<h2>Infix</h2>
<p>The traditional solution for the arithmetic dataflow case, of course,
is to divide the computation into unary and binary operations and
write them in infix notation; the above MIPS assembly then renders as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>($t0₀ &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 &lt;&lt; 2) + ($gp₀ + 28)
</code></pre>
<p>This is considerably easier to follow, bringing related things closer
together and eliminating most of the accidental names, ending up about
three times shorter.</p>
<p>By itself, it only covers a very restricted range of cases:
tree-shaped digraphs, in which, if interpreted as dataflow graphs,
each value is used only once, producing a single output.  But it isn’t
immediately obvious how to apply that to get more general kinds of
graphs.</p>
<h2>Kleene’s Theorem</h2>
<p>Stephen Kleene (whose name I mispronounced for 21 years as [klin], but
TIL it’s actually [kleɪni]) showed that any regular language, and thus
the possible paths through a finite state automaton, can be generated
by a regular expression.  As I understand it, a regular expression on
some alphabet Γ is recursively defined as the smallest language L such
that</p>
<pre><code>L = Γ ∪ ({“concat”, “alt”} × L × L) ∪ (L × {“*”}) ∪ {∅, ε}
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm, that definition is shitty, I’ll try again.  A regular expression
<code>Γ re</code> over Γ is defined as the sum type</p>
<pre><code>Γ re = Lit of Γ
     | Concat of (Γ re × Γ re)
     | Alt of (Γ re × Γ re)
     | Closure of Γ re
     | Impossible
     | Emptystring
</code></pre>
<p>The language generated by a regular expression is defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>lang(Lit(x)) = {x}
lang(Concat(a, b)) = {wa || wb for wa in lang(a) for b in lang(b)}
lang(Alt(a, b)) = lang(a) ∪ lang(b)
lang(Closure(a)) = {ε} ∪ lang(Concat(a, Closure(a)))
lang(Impossible) = ∅
lang(Emptystring) = {ε}
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>||</code> is string concatenation.  (Or word concatenation, as
combinatorists apparently like to say.  And who can argue?  A C
program as little resembles a piece of twine as it does an entry in
the dictionary.)</p>
<p>So the nifty thing here is that this gives you a way to generate all
possible finite-state-machine languages by building up a finite-state
machine from simpler single-entry single-exit finite-state machines,
which is to say, building up a directed graph from simpler
two-terminal directed graphs.  You can’t express every possible graph
in this way; in particular, there are a set of “irreducible control
flow structures” which, if present, require duplication of nodes.
(McCabe’s 1976 paper “A Complexity Measure” explains in more detail in
the context of program control flow.)</p>
<p>Traditionally in regular expressions we write Concat, Alt, and Closure
as mere juxtaposition, infix <code>|</code>, and postfix <code>*</code>, respectively,
although, in the context of Kleene algebras, alternation is
traditionally written with infix <code>+</code> instead.</p>
<p>And this is somewhat more expressive; it can express any
series-parallel circuit.  This includes trees as a subset.  If we use
the traditional <code>|*</code> notation, we can express the above MIPS-assembly
arithmetic graph as follows:</p>
<p>XXX try , instead of |?</p>
<pre><code>(($t0₀ | 1) &gt;&gt;&gt; | 2) &lt;&lt; | ($gp₀ | 28) +) +
</code></pre>
<p>Here we are supposing that constants and variables obliterate whatever
data was present on their branch of the dataflow digraph, that
rejoining dataflows creates a node where both pieces of data are
available (with the left and right branches distinguished!), and that
the operators then reduce the two pieces of data available at their
node to 1.</p>
<p>But now we can also represent the SPICE circuit I gave above, for
example.  One possible representation is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(v⁻¹[dc 24] r[10k] (r[8.1k] v[dc 15] | r[4.7k]))*
</code></pre>
<p>This contains all the useful information in the original netlist, but
it is both much easier to write and, I would argue, even much easier
to read; it’s easy to see what is in series and what is in parallel.
Interpreted as a regular expression, it yields all of the possible
traversals through the circuit in a certain direction (which could be
the direction current is flowing, but happens not to be).</p>
<p>It’s common to be able to express the majority of an electrical
circuit in terms of such series-parallel circuits, with the occasional
deviation from series-parallel constructions; the same is true for
control flow in programs.</p>
<h2>Postfix</h2>
<p>The arithmetic expression above may look suspicious:</p>
<pre><code>(($t0₀ | 1) &gt;&gt;&gt; | 2) &lt;&lt; | ($gp₀ | 28) +) +
</code></pre>
<p>It happens to be exactly equivalent to how you’d express this
expression in postfix (RPN), but with stack relationships explicitly
called out — every time some value produced by <code>b</code> is on top of some
value produced by <code>a</code> on the stack, we have written <code>(a|b)</code> rather
than just <code>a b</code>.  If we adopt the more usual convention, this
expression reduces to the following:</p>
<pre><code>$t0₀ 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 &lt;&lt; $gp₀ 28 + +
</code></pre>
<p>Can we apply this to the circuit diagram as well?  It’s simple:</p>
<pre><code>{ 24 dc v⁻¹  10 k r  { 8.1 k r  15 dc v | 4.7 k r } }
</code></pre>
<p>Consider the expression as an RPN program to construct a circuit
diagram, with a stack consisting of node identifiers and numbers.  It
begins with a single node identifier on the stack, and it uses the
following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{</code> duplicates the top item on the stack</li>
<li><code>dc</code> pushes some number on the stack used to indicate DC</li>
<li><code>v⁻¹</code> pops a voltage type and parameters from the stack, allocates a
  new node, connects the positive side of a newly created voltage
  source to the new node, connects the negative side to the node on
  the stack, which it pops, and pushes the new node on the stack</li>
<li><code>k</code> multiplies the number on top of the stack by 1000</li>
<li><code>r</code> is analogous to <code>v⁻¹</code> but creates a resistor instead</li>
<li><code>v</code> is exactly the same as <code>v⁻¹</code> but connects its items in the
  opposite order.</li>
<li><code>|</code> exchanges the top two items on the stack</li>
<li><code>}</code> shorts together the two nodes on top of the stack, causing them
  to become equivalent</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that, in this context, this semantics for <code>{ }</code> makes
them adequate both for Kleene closure <code>*</code> and to enclose a binary
alternation <code>|</code> in the context of circuit schematic capture, because a
wire forward from the beginning of a part of a circuit to its end is
the same as a wire backward from its end to its beginning.  In other
contexts, like regular expressions, these two are not equivalent.</p>
<p><code>v⁻¹</code> is a bit suspiciously ad-hoc; really we might prefer this
operation of flipping a bit of circuitry around before connecting it
to be an orthogonal operation, rather than separately defining <code>v⁻¹</code>,
<code>d⁻¹</code>, <code>electrolytic_capacitor⁻¹</code>, and so on.  You could instead
define <code>v</code> to allocate two fresh nodes and push them both on the
stack, then use a separate <code>forward</code> or <code>reverse</code> operation to short
two of them together and remove them from the stack.  Alternatively,
you could have <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> operations that enclose a piece of
circuitry to be reversed — the first allocating a fresh node and
pushing two references to it onto the stack, the second performing the
equivalent of <code>rot }</code>.  But really this is the converse relationship
on binary relations, about which more later.</p>
<p>In general, I find postfix less readable and more error-prone than
infix, so I’m not sure it’s really the right thing, but it has a few
advantages which might be relevant in this context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its semantics are ruthlessly simple and thus easy to implement
  correctly.</li>
<li>It’s very clear to see how to extend it to define new parametric
  components or macros — pseudo-arcs that are really an entire
  subgraph — simply by attaching a name to a sequence of
  graph-construction operations and invoking them as if by copy-paste
  later on.</li>
<li>It smoothly handles three-terminal and multiple-output devices;
  three-terminal devices can, for example, consume two items from the
  stack and produce a third (ideal for things like logic gates) or
  push fresh nodes for all of their terminals onto the stack.  If you
  can define new component macros, you could define a bridge-rectifier
  macro that consumes two AC terminals and returns two DC terminals.</li>
<li>For interactive graph construction and editing, not only does it
  require fewer UI actions than other means of schematic capture, it
  can also provide immediate simulation feedback while the circuit is
  being constructed, because almost everything is already connected
  when it’s constructed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure that “edge-labeled directed graphs” are quite the right
abstraction for electrical circuits.  Yes, a battery or a diode is a
directed relationship between two wire nodes/nets, so representing it
as a labeled directed edge in a graph makes some sense.  But a bipolar
transistor is a relationship between three wire nodes/nets, each of
which has a unique relationship to it, and a microcontroller is in
some sense a relationship between dozens of nodes.  These are more
like hypergraphs, but the existing work on <em>directed</em> hypergraphs is
pretty slim.</p>
<p>This mirrors the state of relational databases and logic programming,
where most of the work is with some arbitrary number of finitary
(N-ary) relations, rather than binary relations.</p>
<p>A bipartite directed graph, where wire nodes/nets are one part and
components are the other part, would be an adequate model.  In
dataflow, the parts would instead be values and operations.</p>
<p>Despite all this stuff and despite being quite compact, postfix, even
augmented with the <code>{ | }</code> operations above, can’t construct arbitrary
edge-labeled directed graphs, just directed graphs whose traversals
are equivalent to traversals of any given directed graph, and that
only at the cost of a potentially exponential expansion in graph size.
In particular, they can’t construct any nonplanar graphs, and not even
all planar graphs.</p>
<h2>Variables/Labels</h2>
<p>The usual solution for this in dataflow is to use (possibly immutable)
named variables, and in control flow to use labels and <code>goto</code> —
essentially escaping back to netlists, where connection is indicated
by coincidence of names rather than proximity.  Labels or variables
are “wormholes” in the otherwise planar and recursive graph
construction; they can connect anywhere.  Usually you don’t need very
many of them.</p>
<p>The above discussion of regular expressions leads us to speculate on
whether we should be labeling nodes, as is normally almost universal,
or entire subgraphs.  Consider the following SPICE model, from the
same textbook page as the example I gave earlier:</p>
<pre><code>fullwave bridge rectifier
v1 1 0 sin(0 15 60 0 0)
rload 1 0 10k
d1 1 2 mod1
d2 0 2 mod1
d3 3 1 mod1
d4 3 0 mod1
.model mod1 d
.tran .5m 25m
.plot tran v(1,0) v(2,3) 
.end
</code></pre>
<p>Like bridge circuits in general, this is not a series-parallel
circuit; you need a label.  You can represent most of it as a
series-parallel circuit; let’s use the postfix form, and suppose we
have the direction-reversing brackets <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> suggested earlier:</p>
<pre><code>{ 15 60 ac v  { d &lt; d &gt; | &lt; d &gt; d } }
</code></pre>
<p>This expresses the entire circuit above except for the load
resistance.  If we add the new operation <code>}=</code> to define a label for a
subgraph, defining the word following it to hook up the two nodes on
the stack as if they were an arc, then we can write it as follows:</p>
<pre><code>{ 10 k r }= rload  { 15 60 ac v  { d rload d | &lt; d rload d &gt; } }
</code></pre>
<p>This defines exactly the same circuit as the SPICE model in a third
less text, although it doesn’t specify the simulation parameters.
Each time <code>rload</code> is invoked, it connects its environment to the
<em>same</em> component, unlike things like <code>d</code>, which generate a new
component each time they’re invoked.</p>
<p>Alternatively, and more traditionally, we could define <code>}=</code> to simply
define a name for the node on top of the stack, removing it from the
stack; when invoked, the name shorts that saved node to whatever is on
top of the stack at the time.  Then we can define the circuit as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>{ 15 60 ac v  { d { 10 k r }= rload &lt; d &gt; | &lt; d &gt; rload d } }
</code></pre>
<h2>Explicit series connection</h2>
<p>Another alternative, which I mention here more for completeness rather
than because I think it's necessarily better than the others
mentioned, is to make the series connection explicit rather than
implicit.  In an infix syntax, for example, using the hyphen for the
series connection, perhaps R-C is a series connection of a resistor
and a capacitor, while R|C is a parallel connection.  Then we can do
things like L-(C|L-(C|R)).  Here, as in the notation at the beginning,
the values being combined are not circuit nodes or nets but rather
subcircuits with a beginning and end.</p>
<p>We can, of course, use a stack notation for this as well; for example,
instead of L-(C|L-(C|R)), we could write LCLCR|-|-.  A stack-notation
expression can represent any number of subcircuits rather than just
one, because it can end with any number of items on the stack;
similarly, it can represent a transformation of a circuit or set of
circuits, rather than just a circuit.  (Hmm, this is a digression;
perhaps it belongs elsewhere.)</p>
<p>Without the explicit series combination operator, we can get the same
amount of power in a stack-language context by having an explicit
“push new disconnected node” operator.  I think.</p>
<h2>Other arities of edge creation</h2>
<p>You could also create an edge between the top two nodes on the stack,
consuming both and returning neither.  In this model, you must
explicitly create each node, then explicitly duplicate any node that
will be connected to more than one edge; in a sense, the expected
degree of a node is 1.  (So to get three resistors in series, you
would say NODE DUP NODE R NODE OVER R NODE OVER R. I think.)  The
other approaches I’ve been describing all have, in some sense, an
expected degree of 2 for each node — the operation of adding each new
edge to the graph consumes a node and produces a node, which then can
be merged with some other node in the (implicitly exceptional) case
where that is desired.</p>
<p>You could also imagine leaving all the nodes on the stack, not
consuming any of them, so NODE NODE R R R would give you three
resistors in parallel.</p>
<p>What’s the best default node degree?</p>
<p>Eyeballing a couple of small schematics, I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 nets, 8 2-terminal components, 2 3-terminal components, average
  degree of <code>(/ (+ (* 8 2) (* 2 3)) 8.0)</code> = 2.75.</li>
<li>12 nets, 8 2-terminal components, 6 3-terminal components, average
  degree of <code>(/ (+ (* 8 2) (* 6 3)) 12.0)</code> = 2.83̄.</li>
<li>4 nets, 4 2-terminal components, 1 3-terminal component, average
  degree of <code>(/ (+ (* 4 2) (* 1 3)) 4.0)</code> = 2.75.</li>
<li>9 nets, 2 2-terminal components, 1 3-terminal component, 1
  5-terminal component, average degree of <code>(/ (+ (* 2 2) (* 1 3) (* 1
  5)) 9.0)</code> = 1.3̄.</li>
<li>12 nets, 12 2-terminal components, 5 3-terminal components, average
  degree of <code>(/ (+ (* 12 2) (* 5 3)) 12.0)</code> = 3.25.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some sense, this suggests that the “average” degree of a circuit
net (i.e. wire) is somewhere around 3.</p>
<p>However, that’s including the power rails and ground as nets, which
commonly have lots of connections.  For example, in the last circuit
above (Figure 12.67 from Horowitz &amp; Hill 3ed., a simple laser drive
circuit), ground has 7 connections and the positive power rail has 3.
If we discount those, the average goes down to 2.416̄.  The first
circuit, figure 5.56, has three ground connections; discounting those
gives us 2.375.</p>
<p>Consequently, I think that the most likely optimum is not 1 or ∞ or
even somehow 3 but 2.</p>
<h2>Binary relations and the relational product</h2>
<p>A few years back I spent some time on <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/binary-relations">a database query language based
on binary relations called Binate</a>.  It has several things in
common with the work I’m describing here.</p>
<p>One of the things I never resolved properly in Binate was the status
of constants; I treated them as relations from anything whatsoever to
the constant value, like the transformation of a register state
produced by a load-immediate instruction.  This introduces potentially
awkward infinities if you take its converse.</p>
<p>Binate uses a really-infix grammar whose expressions all evaluate to
binary relations, so it handles non-binary finitary relations with an
N-ary relational-product operation, which produces nodes that
participate in a bunch of fresh binary relations.</p>
<h2>Labels, dynamic scope, and linking</h2>
<p>Earlier I mentioned NAND gates as an example of a three-terminal
circuit element for which it’s natural to consume two input nets from
the stack and produce an output net, but in reality a two-input NAND
gate has five terminals: power and ground.  Usually in a big part of
the circuit you use the same power and ground for all the NAND gates,
but maybe not in the entire design.  Flip-flops additionally have a
clock, and it’s very common to hook lots of them up to the same clock,
but to have more than one clock domain in a design.</p>
<p>An analogous phenomenon pops up in graphics programming: it’s common
to do a bunch of drawing operations with the same color, the same
font, the same line joins, and so on.  It’s annoying to have to
specify this in every drawing operation.</p>
<p>Dynamically-scoped variables — accessible to lots of things, but set
during particular dynamic scopes and restored afterwards — are one
possible solution for this.  In a stack machine, you could use a
PostScript-style <code>load</code> operation to save the current binding of a
label on the stack, then run a bunch of graph-constructing code, then
restore it at the end.  This requires that invoking the label connect
you to its current value, like a DEFERred word in Forth or like an
operator in PostScript, not like a regular word in Forth.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at this is that it’s like what a linker does
with an object file: it resolves the relocations for a given label to
point to a given label definition from its environment at link time.</p>
<p>In some cases it may make sense to provide default arguments for
things like pullup resistors and bypass capacitors, and those could be
provided in a similar way, rather than taken from the stack.</p>
<h2>Dropping brackets for parallel construction</h2>
<p>In a sense the above uses series combination as the default operation,
which can be sort of overridden by providing a different context, like
the <code>{ }</code> or <code>&lt; &gt;</code> contexts.  In algebra, we also have a default
operation, which is multiplication, but we don't have to write <code>{ 3x²
+ { 2x + 5 } }</code> conventionally; instead we just write <code>3x² + 2x +
5</code>. You could implement this by beginning with an empty sum
(consisting of, say, 0) and an empty term (consisting of 1) “on the
stack” and having the <code>+</code> separator sum the top two terms and push a
new empty term “on the stack”; then all the other things can just
implicitly multiply.  This does require a final summing action on
termination of input, and it can’t handle infix division (it needs
brackets), but that's not so relevant to graph construction.</p>
<p>You could insist on a single outermost set of parentheses, with these
stack effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(</code> pushes 0 1</li>
<li><code>)</code> adds the top two items on the stack</li>
<li><code>+</code>, as before, adds the top two items on the stack and pushes 1</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules give the right answer for nested expressions like
<code>( ( 3 x + 2 ) x + 4 )</code>.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
