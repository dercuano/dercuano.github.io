(7 minutes)</div><p>I’ve been designing a new chat/email UI called Desbarrerarme, and one
of the design approaches I want to try out is computing the UI state
as mostly a pure function of the input history of the system.</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve been thinking about for Desbarrerarme is
querying.  By far the nicest existing way I’ve found to do normal
queries is Prolog/Datalog; it’s dramatically better than SQL or
Tutorial D.  (Binate may be better, but it’s unfinished.).  However,
it’s not totally clear to me how to do aggregate queries, in
particular “top N” queries.</p>
<p>I’ve been struggling with this for a long time; see
e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1467898/what-language-could-i-use-for-fast-execution-of-this-database-summarization-task">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1467898/what-language-could-i-use-for-fast-execution-of-this-database-summarization-task</a>.
(“Top 5 scores and their dates for each player”; one response: “Top-N
is a well-known database killer. As shown by the post above, there is
no way to efficiently express it in common SQL.”)</p>
<p>Here are some example queries I’ve been thinking about for
Desbarrerarme:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the N most recently updated threads (i.e. threads with the
   most recent messages)?  Because those are the ones we want to show
   on the screen.</li>
<li>What are the participants and the most recent message in each of the
   N most recently updated threads?  Because that’s what we want to
   display on the left side.</li>
<li>What are the N most recent messages in thread X?  Because those are
   the ones we want on the screen.</li>
<li>What are the N most recently updated threads <em>I haven’t tagged as
   to-archive</em>?</li>
<li>What are the N next scheduled reminders after the beginning of
   today that I haven’t marked as taken-care-of?</li>
<li>What are the N best threads that contain the words “apache” and
   “spark”, case-insensitively, where “best” is some kind of
   combination of recency and TF/IDF?</li>
</ol>
<p>If we have a single relation <code>messages</code> with the columns <code>when,
thread, from, body</code>, and some similar thing for reminders, it’s
apparent how to compute each of these inefficiently.  We can
calculate #2, for example, like this:</p>
<pre><code>participants = {}
last_message = {}
top_n = []
for when, thread, from_, body in sorted(messages):
    if thread in top_n:
        top_n.pop(top_n.index(thread))
    else:
        if len(top_n) &gt;= n:
            top_n.pop(0)
    top_n.append(thread)

    if thread not in participants:
        participants[thread] = set([from_])
    else:
        participants[thread].add(from_)

    last_message[thread] = (when, body)

for thread in top_n:
    yield participants[thread], last_message[thread]
</code></pre>
<p>This has three big disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s a lot of code.  The English version of the question was 18
   words; the Python version above is 18 lines.</li>
<li>That code is poorly abstracted, so it isn’t reusable.  For example,
   it’s very likely that this isn’t the only place we’d like to know
   the participants of a chat.</li>
<li>It’s inefficient.  It inherently needs to traverse the entire
   <code>messages</code> relation, which might be many gigabytes, and it
   accumulates a potentially large <code>participants</code> relation in memory
   because it doesn’t know at the outset which threads are going to be
   included in the final result.</li>
</ol>
<p>Problems #2 and #3 are interrelated.  For example, if we could freeze
the whole execution state of the loop partway through, then we could
incrementally recompute its final state if new messages were added
with a later date.</p>
<p>Better still, in this case, you could break the computations down into
a monoid tree — <code>participants</code> can be computed from results over
subsets of the data set simply using the union operation, while
<code>top_n</code> could be computed from results over subsets of the data set by
concatenating those results (ordered by timestamps) and truncating to
the last N.  Abstracting the operations to this level would allow them
to be not only recomputed incrementally after updates, but also
parallelized and made fault-tolerant.  Also, the <code>top_n</code> result is
probably somewhat lazy — it’s probably possible to compute the most
recently updated 10 or 20 chats without looking further back than 1–30
days.</p>
<p>Ideally, we could find a set of language primitives to express queries
like these that would make the query simple to express.  Something
like maybe</p>
<pre><code>top = max(when) by thread | sortby when desc | limit n
participants = distinct(project(thread, from))
latest = max(when, body) by thread
(participants naturaljoin latest) if thread ∈ top.thread
</code></pre>
<p>Or, I don’t know, something still more concise.  And ideally that set
of language primitives would expose enough structure to a runtime to
allow the orthogonal specification or even inference of optimizations
like the ones suggested above; and ideally it would also, like the
above, make it straightforward to reuse the definitions for other
things.</p>
<p>Also, if it’s not too much to ask, generalize the materialized views
that are used to speed up incremental recomputation so that they can
be used for a larger range of queries than just the current ones.
That is, maybe I only asked for the latest 12 chats, but maybe it
would be prudent to calculate the latest 24 or 64 if that isn’t
harder; and maybe <code>latest</code> only contains <code>when</code> and <code>body</code> here, but
maybe we should also keep <code>from</code> just in case.</p>
<p>Additionally, I’d like to get the results from these queries
incrementally, so that the UI isn’t frozen while the query is being
evaluated.</p>
<p>This seems like it might be related to Spark’s concept of “resilient
distributed datasets”.  I need to read more.</p>
<h2>Faster brute force</h2>
<p>An alternative approach to caching and materializing a bunch of shit
is trying to make brute-force query evaluation sufficiently fast.
Considering this <code>messages</code> thing again, suppose I had 10 messages per
second for the last 20 years.  (Busy IRC channels.)  That’s 6.3
billion messages.  But maybe there are less than 65536 participants,
so participants can be identified by 16-bit numbers; so the
participants column there is only 12 gigabytes, and it’s probably
highly enough compressible with LZ4 to fit into RAM easily.
Similarly, suppose we’re using 64-bit microseconds for <code>when</code>; now we
have 50 gigabytes of timestamps, but again, they probably fit into RAM
easily with LZ4.  The message bodies won’t, but they’ll fit on a small
SSD, and will probably compress enough to hit RAM-like speeds for
scanning.</p>
<p>And the above query, if the query optimizer is lucky enough to pick a
reasonable evaluation order, should only need to traverse the tail end
of the <code>when</code> and <code>thread</code> columns before hitting <code>n</code>, and then the
entire <code>from</code> column.  Still, this is probably not going to get us to
subsecond response times.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/syntax.html">Syntax</a> (28 notes)
