(11 minutes)</div><p>Parallel arrays are bad because array indices are untyped, and
sometimes because of storage management and locality of reference.
But what if each array had its own <code>⎕IO</code> (APL's name for <code>OPTION
BASE</code>)?  This could put each type of object ID into its own namespace,
so that you'd get an index error if you tried to index an array with
the wrong kind of object ID.  It's like how in a spreadsheet, maybe
rows 1-40 are the employees, and rows 101-120 are the products, and so
if you have an index between 101 and 120, you know it identifies a
product and not an employee.  (Too bad that in an actual spreadsheet
the column names will be the same in both cases.)</p>
<p>You could actually index arrays using an (object type,
zero-based-index) pair rather than combining the two into a single
number.  This would give you many of the same type-safety and
index-safety benefits of structs, aka records, without sacrificing the
dubious benefits of aggregate operations.  (And if you can verify all
the type stuff at compile time, you could drop them at runtime!)</p>
<p>Element-by-element scalar functions should only work on arrays
representing, in some sense, attributes of the same object.
Operations like "grade up" and "compress" would create new index
namespaces.</p>
<p>"Interesting" functions from APL (not element-by-element) include
monadic <code>⍴⍳,⌹⌽⊖⍋⍒⍉</code>, dyadic <code>∈⍴↑↓⊥⊤,\/⍳⌹⌽⊖⍉</code> and indexing [], plus the
operators (scan, reduce, and inner and outer product).</p>
<p>The details I've been able to work out follow.</p>
<p>Since much of this is sort of about types, I'm going to write types in
a Haskelly way: <code>a-&gt;b</code> means that something (a vector) takes as an
argument (index) things of type <code>a</code>, and returns (has as elements)
things of type <code>b</code>; and <code>X: T</code> is an expression which has the value of
<code>X</code>, but asserts that that value is of type <code>T</code>.</p>
<h2>Multidimensional arrays</h2>
<p>I'm going to try to work out the cases of zero and one dimensions
first, before attempting to handle multiple dimensions.  An
N-dimensional array for N&gt;0 can be considered as either a homogeneous
1-dimensional array of N-1-dimensional arrays, an array indexed by
N-tuples, or an N-1-dimensional array of 1-dimensional arrays; both of
the first two interpretations are common in APL.  Changing the nature
of indexing is likely to interact with them in unpredictable ways.</p>
<h2>Indexing <code>[]</code></h2>
<p>Indexing <code>A[B]</code> (also <code>.</code> or simple juxtaposition in K, or <code>A@B</code> for
another variant) should produce a value with the shape of B by
indexing the elements of A.  That is, </p>
<pre><code>((A: c-&gt;d)[B: e-&gt;c]): e-&gt;d
</code></pre>
<p>It's like function composition.  So the elements of B need to be valid
indices for A.</p>
<h2>Compress <code>/</code></h2>
<p>Dyadic <code>A/B</code>, "compress", gives you one element of output for every
nonzero element in A.  Its two arguments must have the same set of
indices, and the left one must be boolean.  If you compress two
vectors <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> with the same vector <code>A</code>, the resulting vectors
need to be conformable, so you can write <code>(A/B) + (A/C)</code>, for example.</p>
<p>In q/k/kdb+, I think this is written <code>B[where A]</code>, helpfully
decomposing the operation into two steps, the first of which is
constructing a vector of the positions where <code>A</code> is nonzero.  I think
this is the right way to analyze this operation, because it constructs
a <em>new index namespace</em>: </p>
<pre><code>(where (A: b-&gt;c)): d-&gt;b
</code></pre>
<p>(This is a rather remarkable type, creating a new type out of whole
cloth!)</p>
<p>Indeed, this is such a common operation in APL that the Dyalog APL
tutorial gives the APL spelling of it, <code>(V∈D)/⍳⍴V</code>, as their first
example of an idiomatic APL expression.</p>
<p>It's probably more accurate to write <code>(where (A: b-&gt;bool)): d-&gt;b</code>,
since the</p>
<h2>Expand <code>\</code></h2>
<p>I haven't written enough APL to know what the dyadic expand function
is good for.  In a sense, it's the inverse of the compress function,
but the compress function is lossy — it leaves out chunks of its right
input, which the expand function will fill with zeroes.  It's
guaranteed that <code>A/A\B</code> is the same as <code>B</code>, but not <code>A\A/B</code>.</p>
<p>It seems rather difficult to type-check in a sane fashion: <code>A</code> needs
to have exactly as many <code>1</code>s set as there are valid indices in <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>Dyalog APL's expand function extends this to the case where <code>A</code> may
contain things beyond just booleans, interpreting them as a repeat
count (or, if negative, a zero count).</p>
<p>The Dyalog APL tutorial gives the following common uses of expand:</p>
<ul>
<li>to add blank or zero rows in between the rows of a matrix (for
  example, to separate text output into paragraphs);</li>
<li>to repeat a scalar some number of times.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also gives as an exercise the problem of replacing a given letter
globally with spaces: <code>'a' Whiten 'Panama is a canal between Atlantic
and Pacific'</code> should return 
<code>'P n m  is   c n l between  tl ntic  nd P cific'</code>.  The solution, 
I suppose, is the <code>A\A/B</code> above, where <code>A</code> is just <code>~Letter = Phrase</code>.</p>
<p><a href="http://aplwiki.com/AplIn20Minutes">http://aplwiki.com/AplIn20Minutes</a> may have some information.</p>
<h2>Grade-up and grade-down <code>⍋⍒</code></h2>
<p>These are used for sorting.  <code>⍋X</code> (<code>&gt;X</code> in K) is a vector such that
<code>X[⍋X]</code> is sorted ascending; <code>⍒X</code> does the reverse.  This is more
useful than simply giving you the sorted results because, if you have
another vector <code>Y</code> that can be indexed with the same indices as <code>X</code>,
you can sort the elements of <code>Y</code> according to <code>X</code> with <code>Y[⍋X]</code>.</p>
<p>It does not generally make sense to index <code>X[⍋X]</code> with indices that
are valid for <code>X</code>, with the exception of things that are sort of
coincidental; for example, 1 is probably a valid index for both of
them.  But it doesn't make sense to say, for example, <code>(X &gt; 3)/X[⍋X]</code>;
that's almost certainly a bug.</p>
<p>So grade-up and grade-down, like compress, creates a new index namespace: </p>
<pre><code>(⍋(X: a-&gt;b)): d-&gt;a
(⍒(X: a-&gt;b)): d-&gt;a
</code></pre>
<p>This is maybe the point at which array indices might begin to have an
advantage as object IDs over raw memory addresses: once you can start
taking advantage of the sequence of the array indices.</p>
<h2>Reversal and rotation, monadic and dyadic <code>⌽⊖</code></h2>
<p><code>⌽X</code> is just <code>X</code> with the indices of its last axis in reverse order;
<code>⊖X</code> is the equivalent for the first axis.  Analogously, rotation
<code>3⌽X</code> rotates <code>X</code> three items to the right, which can be achieved by
reversing <code>X</code>, reversing its first three items, and then reversing the
remaining items.  On the face of it, it seems that these should also
create a new index namespace; it doesn't make sense to write <code>(X &gt;
3)/⌽X</code>.</p>
<p>However, I think this is not actually true.  The valid <em>range</em> of
values is the same.  <code>1⌽X</code> gives you the <code>X</code> property of the
(cyclically) following object in <code>X</code>'s index sequence; this is a
useful kind of thing to be able to do!</p>
<pre><code>⌽(X: a-&gt;b): a-&gt;b
⊖(X: a-&gt;b): a-&gt;b
(N: int)⌽(X: a-&gt;b): a-&gt;b
(N: int)⊖(X: a-&gt;b): a-&gt;b
</code></pre>
<h2>Shape and index generation: monadic <code>⍴</code> and monadic <code>⍳</code></h2>
<p><code>⍳</code>, aka "iota" or "index generator" (in K, <code>!</code> or <code>til</code>) counts from
1 (0 in K) to a given number; but its primary use is to generate the
valid indices of a vector given its size.  The size of a vector is
generated with <code>⍴</code>, the "shape" operator (in K, <code>count</code>), so <code>⍳⍴V</code>
gives you the indices of <code>V</code>.</p>
<p>This use of <code>⍳</code> is so important that Dyalog APL's <code>⍳</code> applied to a
vector generates a sequence of multidimensional indices, such that
<code>V[⍳V]</code> is equivalent to V for any shape of V (which is impossible in
traditional APL), and the "index origin" variable <code>⎕IO</code>, equivalent to
BASIC's <code>OPTION BASE</code> can affect <code>⍳</code>'s operation.</p>
<p>Although this form of <code>⍳</code> takes only one argument, it's
straightforward to use it to generate values starting from any
starting point, increasing by every step: <code>start + step * (⍳N)-1</code>,
although of course the <code>-1</code> is a result of the default <code>⎕IO</code> being 1
rather than 0.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it's probably worthwhile to preserve the invariant
that <code>⍳⍴V</code> produces the indices of a vector <code>V</code>.  If this is to work
with <code>⍴V</code> producing a scalar or 1-vector in this case, which seems
desirable to avoid complication for multidimensional cases, then it
needs to be possible to extract both the length and the object type
from that scalar; that is, <code>employees[301]</code> needs to be a single
scalar object from which you can extract <code>employees</code> and 301.  If we
represent <code>employees</code> as <code>employees[0]</code>, then it's sufficient to
provide a function for extracting either of the two; ordinary
subtraction suffices to produce the other, and ordinary addition is
sufficient to recombine the two.</p>
<p>So ⍴ produces a single-element vector:</p>
<pre><code>⍴(X: a-&gt;b): {0}-&gt;a
⍳(X: a): int-&gt;a
</code></pre>
<h2>element-of <code>∈</code> and index-of, dyadic <code>⍳</code></h2>
<p><code>A∈B</code> produces a boolean array of the shape of <code>A</code> indicating whether
each item of <code>A</code> occurs in the vector <code>B</code>; that is,</p>
<pre><code>((A: c-&gt;d) ∈ (B: e-&gt;d)): c-&gt;bool
</code></pre>
<p>The index type of <code>B</code> disappears entirely, because we don't care
<em>where</em> the elements of <code>A</code> occurred in <code>B</code>; we're just using it as a
set.  If we wanted their positions, we'd use the dyadic <code>⍳</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>((A: c-&gt;d) ⍳ (B: e-&gt;d)): c-&gt;e
</code></pre>
<p>This is a little bit tricky, because for the elements of <code>A</code> that
didn't occur at all in <code>B</code>, this function produces <code>1+⍴B</code> (or <code>⍴B</code> in
the <code>⎕IO=0</code> case), which is not a valid index into <code>B</code>.  You could say
it's not a member of <code>B</code>'s index type <code>e</code> at all.</p>
<p>In K, the dyadic <code>⍳</code> function is written <code>B?A</code> instead.</p>
<h2>The things I haven't figured out how to handle yet</h2>
<p>How do you get literal vectors in your program to have a reasonable
type?</p>
<p>What about take, drop, and catenate?  Some uses of take and drop can
be reasonably handled by rotation, but others can't.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
