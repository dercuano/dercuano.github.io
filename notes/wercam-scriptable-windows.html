<p>One of the designs I’m thinking of for window systems for BubbleOS
(see <a href="../notes/bubbleos.html">Speculative plans for BubbleOS</a>) is sort of based on MGR, the Blit, and Plan 9,
with some ideas from NeWS (<a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/unix-haters/x-windows/disaster.html">as filtered through the UNIX-HATERS
Handbook</a>), <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">eBPF</a>, and <a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">Dan Luu’s studies of user
interface latency</a>.  It’s also partly inspired by thinking about
might-have-beens about the VT100, the H19, and the Datapoint 2200 from
the 1970s.</p>
<p>However, see also <a href="../notes/wercam-nonscriptable-windows.html">A nonscriptable design for the Wercam windowing system</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, the issue is that user interface latency is a really big
deal when it comes to the “feel” of an interactive system, and modern
computer software design is making our user interface latency suck
shit, to the point that most modern computers are dramatically less
responsive than an Apple //e.  The Apple //e takes 30 ms to get a
keystroke on the screen, while a typical modern machine takes
100–160 ms, and a tuned modern machine takes 60 ms.  And this gets
worse rather than better when we try to operate our systems over
long-latency links, which are, despite all predictions, increasingly
common in today’s world, despite the concurrent proliferation of
low-latency links.</p>
<p>One approach to the link latency problem is the Lotus Notes strategy:
partially replicate the application state on different nodes,
including some as close to the user as possible, and reconcile the
occasional conflicting update after the fact.  This is more or less
the modern AJAX strategy, but it doesn’t help much with user-interface
latency as such.</p>
<p>A different approach, which is sort of the original use case for JS,
is to put a small amount of application-specific code as close as
possible to the client to react quickly to input events, while
delegating more complex processing to the client application.  As <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/unix-haters/x-windows/disaster.html">Don
Hopkins explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the mere mention of network window systems, certain propeller
gheads who confuse technology with economics will start foaming at
the mouth about their client/server models and how in the future
palmtops will just run the X server and let the other half of the
program run on some Cray down the street. They’ve become unwitting
pawns in the hardware manufacturers’ conspiracy to sell newer
systems each year. After all, what better way is there to force
users to upgrade their hardware than to give them X, where a single
application can bog down the client, the server, and the network
between them, simultaneously!</p>
<p>The database client/server model (the server machine stores all the
data, and the clients beseech it for data) makes sense. The
computation client/server model (where the server is a very
expensive or experimental supercomputer, and the client is a desktop
workstation or portable computer) makes sense. But a graphical
client/server model that slices the interface down some arbitrary
middle is like Solomon following through with his child-sharing
strategy. The legs, heart, and left eye end up on the server, the
arms and lungs go to the client, the head is left rolling around on
the floor, and blood spurts everywhere.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem with X’s notion of client/server is that the
proper division of labor between the client and the server can only
be decided on an application-by-application basis. Some applications
(like a flight simulator) require that all mouse movement be sent to
the application. Others need only mouse clicks. Still others need a
sophisticated combination of the two, depending on the program’s
state or the region of the screen where the mouse happens to
be. Some programs need to update meters or widgets on the screen
every second. Other programs just want to display clocks; the server
could just as well do the updating, provided that there was some way
to tell it to do so.</p>
<p>The right graphical client/server model is to have an extensible
server. Application programs on remote machines can download their
own special extension on demand and share libraries in the
server. Downloaded code can draw windows, track input eents, provide
fast interactive feedback, and minimize network traffic by
communicating with the application using a dynamic, high-level
protocol.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine a CAD application built on top of such an
extensible server. The application could download a program to draw
an IC and associate it with a name. From then on, the client could
draw the IC anywhere on the screen simply by sending the name and a
pair of coordinates. Better yet, the client an download programs and
data structures to draw the whole schematic, which are called
automatically to refresh and scroll the window, without bothering
the client. The user can drag an IC around smoothly, without any
network traffic or context switching, and the server sends a single
message to the client when the interaction is complete. This makes
it possible to run interactive clients over low-speed (that is,
slow-bandwidth) communication lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a security point of view, the idea of uploading arbitrary
application code to the window server is somewhat alarming.  What if
it hangs the window server, or makes it run slowly or unresponsively?
What if one application uploads a malicious version of a widget used
by another application?</p>
<p>Putting a small amount of application code into the input event
handling path is also the approach taken by <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">BPF</a> for packet
filtering: tcpdump uploads a tiny bytecode program into the BSD kernel
to discard uninteresting packets <em>in interrupt context</em>, forwarding
the interesting packets to the user-level program.  This avoids
context-switching to the tcpdump process for every network packet,
which was seriously important in 1992 when BPF was designed, and even
more important in 1980 when its stack-machine predecessor, CSPF, was
designed.</p>
<p>BPF’s instruction set has 22 instructions and two registers, but only
supports forward jumps, so it cannot express loops.  <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">eBPF</a>, which
includes things like functions and user-accessible data structures, is
now used by Linux not only for packet filtering, but also for
sandboxing processes (a purpose for which MacOS uses a tiny Scheme),
inserting debugging and performance probes into the kernel, XXX</p>
<h2>Uses of scriptability in Wercam</h2>
<p>Suppose that application programs can upload event-handler scripts for
a similar virtual machine into the Wercam window server, which then
compiles and runs them.  Then maybe those scripts can provide quicker
responsiveness than the applications themselves, because they’re
running in the process that directly draws into the framebuffer.
Indeed, maybe at some point we can move that process out of the
time-sharing operating system the applications are running on, into a
real-time executive like the one in RTLinux, or even onto dedicated
display-handling hardware.  Then we can get the latency of user
interface responsiveness down into the submillisecond range where the
delay really is undetectable by humans.</p>
<p>But to guarantee this kind of responsiveness, especially without
rewriting major parts of your application in this strange virtual
machine, we must limit the amount of context available to the
event-handler script; and it might not produce the ultimately correct
display immediately.  In a lot of cases, this is probably okay.  Mosh
does something similar with typing: when you type a printable
character, it immediately adds it to your screen, and then it
reconciles the screen image with the remote host, so if the character
didn’t get echoed by the application there, it disappears.</p>
<p>What kinds of things might you reasonably add?</p>
<h3>Input event selection</h3>
<p>Well, one simple example is that you can specify which events you
would like the window server to send to the client.  Don’s example of
how some applications would like all mouse movement, while others just
want clicks, is the simplest example.  You can implement it easily if
your event-handler script is in charge of sending the events back to
the client; it can simply return without doing anything when the
mouse-button state hasn’t changed since the last event.  This
mechanism is more complicated than the X11 mechanism:</p>
<pre><code>  /* Apparently StructureNotifyMask is what you use to get MapNotify
   * events? */
  XSelectInput(w-&gt;display, w-&gt;window, KeyPressMask
               | KeyReleaseMask
               | ButtonPressMask
               | ButtonReleaseMask
               | PointerMotionMask
               | StructureNotifyMask
  );
</code></pre>
<p>But it’s probably a lot easier to debug!</p>
<h3>Bit gravity</h3>
<p>X11 has a “bit gravity” feature which modifies window resize handling.
If the bit gravity of a window is set to, for example,
<code>NorthEastGravity</code>, then when a window is resized, the previous window
contents are in the upper right corner of the screen (“northeast” in
the conventional mapping of compass directions to maps).  This matters
because there is a span of time between the window resize on the
server and when the application may be able to respond by redrawing
the window.  Indeed, when X was designed in the 1980s, window redraws
often took several video frames, even when there were no issues of
system load.</p>
<h3>Input event translation</h3>
<p>A more interesting example — and this is where we get into MGR and
Blit territory — is that if the client’s event-handler script is
responsible for sending the events to the client, maybe it can also
determine the form of those events.  Like, maybe you could add a
mouse-compatibility layer in front of some program written for a
character-cell terminal, just by defining a few event handlers.</p>
<h3>Application-to-display stream parsing?</h3>
<p>Of course, that suggests that the event-handler script could <em>also</em> be
in charge of the handling of data <em>from the client</em>.  And then maybe
you could, as the Blit does, start out in a glass-tty mode with some
default event handlers that provide glass tty behavior, and then
upload new event handlers with escape sequences.</p>
<p>That’s probably not actually ideal, for a couple of reasons.  First,
graphical applications can easily involve sufficiently massive data
volumes that we want to minimize the number of copies of that data.
(I’m typing this on a 1920×1080 32bpp 60Hz screen, which multiplies
out to 497,664,000 bytes of pixel data per second.  mpv can actually
reliably get that data on the screen, using OpenGL.  We probably don’t
want that data flowing through an unaligned FIFO, and we probably
don’t want client bytecode to be in charge of parsing it, because
despite the potential advantages of XXX</p>
<p>It’s probably better to maintain the application-to-display protocol
fixed, but include in it the ability for the application to directly
invoke previously-uploaded event handlers, including event handlers
that won’t fire on any window-system-generated events.</p>
<h3>Vertical sync for tear-free redrawing</h3>
<p>Another interesting example is the unfortunately-named† XSYNC
extension, intended to provide tearing-free and flicker-free
double-buffering for X11, as well as audio/video synchronization.  It
was <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/libXext/synclib.html">proposed in 1991</a> but <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/Obsolescence/#xsync">the Linux implementation still lacks
access to the vsync signal</a> needed to make it work, despite <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/FreedesktopProjects/#synchronization">some
work on this in 2003</a>.  <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/guide/extensions/#index5h2">XSYNC works by corking up the
pipeline</a> of drawing requests from a given client until some
condition becomes true, such as a given timestamp passing, a counter
incrementing, or <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/354596/">the monitor going into vsync</a>.  Then the pipeline
gets uncorked and updates the screen during the vertical blanking
interval (VBI) or renders the next animation frame or whatever.</p>
<p>† “Unfortunately named” because an almost, but not completely,
unrelated core X11 function is called <code>XSync()</code>.</p>
<p>Aside from the clumsy special-casing in the <code>XSyncWaitCondition</code>
struct (which you can read about in the docs if you’re interested),
implementing vertical synchronization just by uncorking a drawing
request pipeline excludes many optimizations we would like to do.
Consider <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.29.4871&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=132">what Massalin said about terminal emulation in
Synthesis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The numbers in Table 7.5 can be used to predict the elapsed time for
the “cat /etc/termcap” measurement done in Section 7.2.2.
Performing the calculation, we get 3.4 seconds if we ignore the
invocation overhead and use only the per-character costs. Notice
that this exceeds the elapsed time actually observed (Table 7.2).
This unexpected result happens because Synthesis kernel [sic] can
optimize the data flow, resulting in fewer calls and less actual
work than a straight concatenation of the three quajects would
indicate.  For example, in a fast window system, many characters may
be scrolled off the screen between the consecutive vertical scans of
the monitor.  Since these characters would never be seen by a user,
they need not be drawn.  The Synthesis window manager bypasses the
drawing of those characters by using fine-grained scheduling.  It
samples the content of the virtual VT100 screen 60 times a second,
synchronized to the vertical retrace of the monitor, and draws the
parts of the screen that have changed since the last time.  This is
a good example of how fine-grain scheduling can streamline
processing, bypassing I/O that does not affect the visible result.
The data is not lost, however.  All the data is available for review
using the window’s scrollbars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of optimization — which, incidentally, improves
predictability and reduces user-interface latency — can’t be done
simply by uncorking a drawing pipeline at a predetermined time.  You
have to avoid sticking useless drawing operations into the drawing
pipeline in the first place.</p>
<p>It would, on the other hand, be easy to implement this drawing
approach as an event-handler script, although not without some kind of
looping capabilities.  Note that in this case the loop indexes over
the terminal screen contents, which is a finite-size data object, and
so it’s amenable to worst-case execution-time guarantee calculation —
just not in such a straightforward way as BPF’s loop-free
virtual-machine instruction set.  (And you could limit execution time
by, for example, inserting an Ethereum-style gas check before each
backward jump or potentially-recursive function call, although a
static check seems perhaps more desirable, since it moves the error
reporting to a client request instead of a failed window redraw.)</p>
<p>(Despite the complaining in the links above, it’s actually reported to
be possible to get tear-free redraws under X11; <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30277659/how-to-wait-for-vsync-in-xlib-app">GLX is reported to be
adequate</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5f4ul3/does_wayland_actually_eliminate_tearing/daig3ey/">when used properly</a>, but I think I do see tearing
in mpv using an OpenGL visual.)</p>
<p>Terminal emulators may be a somewhat unusual case, though.  The
“source” contents of a terminal window is small (typically a few
kilobytes) and bounded, so it’s safe for a window server to traverse
it during the VBI; and it’s much smaller (typically 200× smaller,
though this varies by font size and pixel depth) than the pixel data
in the window, updating the “source” is inherently much cheaper than
updating the pixel data; and the source may suffer massive quantities
of updates while it’s not visible.  Other kinds of applications
(hypertext browsers, movie players, PDF viewers) might not have all
these properties.</p>
<p>So it may not be ideal to design Wercam around what’s best for
terminal emulators.</p>
<p>However, tear-free vertically-synced redrawing is desirable for many
applications.</p>
<h3>Window-server-side text editing</h3>
<p>However, modern GUI programs are full of text fields, and each text
field is a full-fledged text editor.  Much of the time, the app
doesn’t care about the intermediate values of the text field, only its
eventual value.  Rather than simply doing local echo of keystrokes,
ideally the vast majority of keystrokes and mouse clicks could be
handled by the window server without any interaction with the
application process at all, until it wants the contents of the text
field, or the user sends some keystroke that the text field doesn’t
handle.</p>
<p>This requires the window location and shape, font metrics, font
glyphs, and buffer contents to be all maintained in the window server,
where they’re accessible to the client-sent event handlers.  The font
glyphs in particular are a potential problem, given the rendering time
and total size of full Unicode fonts, so probably some kind of
glyph-rendering-on-demand is needed, with some kind of placeholder
displayed for not-yet-loaded glyphs.</p>
<p>With Unicode, combining characters and bidirectional text rendering
are another big ball of hassle that is probably best not uploaded in
tiny event handlers.</p>
<p>But even handling the most basic actions with low latency — cursor
positioning with the mouse or arrow keys, inserting characters,
deleting characters with backspace — would go a long way to reducing
the latency of user interaction with text fields.</p>
<h3>Keyahead and mouseahead for menus</h3>
<p>One of the benefits of Don Hopkins’s implementation of <a href="https://medium.com/@donhopkins/pie-menu-fud-and-misconceptions-be8afc49d870">pie menus in
the window server in NeWS was “mouseahead”</a>: since mouse movements
that followed the click that brought up the pie menu weren’t processed
until the pie menu was already active, there’s no window of time
during which a too-fast click or release will be lost.  This is
analogous to how you can “key ahead” or “type ahead” in
keyboard-driven menu or data-entry systems; you don’t need to wait for
the application to display a menu before selecting from it, or to move
the cursor to the next field before typing into it.  The same sequence
of actions will always have the same result regardless of details of
timing or how fast the application manages to respond, which makes the
system feel better, allowing the user to control it quickly with
open-loop control.</p>
<p>A very simple event-handler script is adequate to track the user’s
position in a menu tree and navigate it by mouse movements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Keyahead” is a rather old term, appearing for example in <a href="https://electrickery.hosting.philpem.me.uk/comp/trs80m2/doc/TandyModel2DiskOperatingSystemReferenceManual.pdf">the TRS-80
Model II DOS manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Keyaheads</h4>
<p>TRSDOS allows keyaheads of up to 80 characters.  This means that you
can type in the next command while previous ones are being executed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A keyahead will not be displayed until TRSDOS or the
application program is ready to interpret it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t know of a modern term for the phenomenon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MATE, the desktop environment I’m using at the moment, has a serious
failure of both keyahead and mouseahead.  It has a
Microsoft-Windows-95-style “Start” menu, which can be activated either
by clicking the menu button or by pressing the Microsoft Windows key
on the keyboard.  When it hasn’t been used for a while, though, it
gets slow (presumably relevant stuff needs to be read from disk) and
subsequent keys or mouse actions are captured by whatever the
foreground application window is, rather than being routed to the
menu.  This means that, even when the menu opens quickly, you have to
wait for it to appear before starting to select things from it.</p>
<h3>Animation, compositing, and filtering</h3>
<p>It’s beneficial for filtering (for e.g. text drop shadows) to run in
the display server rather than the app.</p>
<h2>Other protocol considerations</h2>
<p>Applicaiton embedding (e.g. a Flash player or movie player in a web
browser) will really benefit a lot if there’s a way to avoid copying
all the pixel data first from one application to the other, then to
the server.</p>
<h2>Tentative protocol design</h2>
<p>The primitive unit of drawing is a 32×32-pixel tile in premultiplied
32-bit RGBA format with the bytes in that order.  This representation
is chosen for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s 4096 bytes, the usual memory page size on i386 and amd64
  systems.  That means that in theory you should be able to transfer
  tile buffers between clients and servers on the same machine without
  copying them, just by remapping memory, at least if they’re properly
  aligned.  It may have undesirable cache effects for operations on
  corresponding pixels in multiple tiles, but typically these are done
  on only three or four tiles at a time, and all modern L1D caches are
  at least four-way set-associative.</li>
<li>A single scan line of it is 32 pixels, which is 128 bytes.  This is
  larger than, and divisible by, the cache line size on currently
  popular desktop CPUs, which is 64 bytes.  It’s also larger than any
  of the SIMD registers in current popular CPUs, which max out at 512
  bits (64 bytes).  A single color plane of it would be only 32 bytes,
  which would be smaller than a 512-bit AVX512 register, but would fit
  in the more commonly used 256-bit SIMD registers.</li>
<li>It’s smaller than typical L1D cache sizes (≈64 KiB), so you can fit
  several tiles in the L1 cache at once.</li>
<li>It’s large enough that most pixels (87.9%) are interior pixels, not
  border pixels.</li>
<li>It’s large enough that unaligned blitting from one tile to another
  will still only run into tile boundaries every 16 pixels on average.</li>
<li>It’s small enough to keep wasted space in tiles that run off the
  edge of a window to a tolerable level.  To take a random window size
  that would fit on this display, a 949×1067 window is 30×34 tiles, or
  31×35 tiles if none of its edges are aligned on tile boundaries.
  That’s a total of 1,111,040 pixels, while the window as such
  contains 1,012,583 pixels, so you have 9% waste.  Windows I actually
  have open on this display have sizes like 800×482, 656×362, and of
  course 1920×1080.  Many of these are divisible by 16; some are even
  divisible by 32.</li>
<li>It’s the pixel format this video system uses.  Most video systems,
  in fact.  And it’s easy to work with.  And it has alpha.  It has the
  great disadvantage that it’s twice as big as the 16-bit and 15-bit
  formats common in mobile phone displays and video formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tiled images can efficiently support filtering and rescaling
operations, which, like alpha-compositing, are fundamental to
currently fashionable GUIs.</p>
<p>There are two ways to draw things: either send a tile from the
application to the display server, sticking it into a tile-aligned
position on some pixmap, or blit some pixels from one pixmap to
another.  Blitting uses the premultiplied version of the Porter–Duff
“over” operator to modify the destination pixmap with the source
pixmap, as in Plan9’s 8½ or the usual use of the XRENDER extension.</p>
<p>Blitting coordinates can exceed the boundaries of the source pixmap,
which is not an error; instead, the pixmap wraps.  Destination pixmap
coordinates are clipped as you would expect.</p>
<p>Note that this leaves out the “hold out of” and “add” Porter–Duff
operations, as well as the possibility of using an alpha channel from
another source, which are present in the XRENDER Composite request.</p>
<p>When the application creates a thing, such as a pixmap, a data buffer,
or an event handler, it specifies the identifier it will use in the
future to identify that thing.  This eliminates the round trips that
would be needed if the display server were to be responsible for
allocating these identifiers, as in X11 and 8½.  The application must
first request resource allocations to be used by these later
creations; the resource allocation may be denied, but if it is
granted, the creations are guaranteed to succeed precisely when they
do not exceed the allocated quantity.</p>
<p>Duplicate tiles are not coalesced in the memory of the display server,
as they are in XRENDER.  This is because, in any case, this could not
be visible to applications, for security reasons.  Reducing the charge
against the application’s pixel quota would make applications unstable
in a difficult-to-debug way; they would fail to allocate sufficient
pixels only when certain other applications were running.  Pixmaps are
writable, and Wercam is designed to provide guaranteed real-time
responsivity, which means that even copy-on-write tile sharing is
probably a bad idea, because it means that writing a pixel might vary
in speed by orders of magnitude depending on whether that tile was
shared.  (And this is a side-channel information leak if the timing is
observable to the application, which it surely would be.)</p>
<p>Another desirable property of the system is that you should be able to
capture and replay a protocol stream, as you can with ttyrec, and in
particular that it should be possible to generate a “checkpoint”
containing just the protocol messages necessary to get the window into
the current state, so that a checkpointed application can be
reconnected to a fresh window server, if desired.</p>
