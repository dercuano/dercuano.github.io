(3 minutes)</div><p>LZ77 compression uses backreferences of the form (distanceback,
length).  You could think of this as a call to a subroutine consisting
of a sequence of previously produced characters: the distanceback is
like a PC-relative jump destination address.  But the length is
curious: it tells how long the subroutine is!  In ordinary machine
code, several different subroutines can share a common tail by having
different entry points, each of which falls through into the next; but
in LZ77-land, several different "subroutines" can share a common
<em>head</em> as well, by being "called" from "callsites" with different
lengths.</p>
<p>This means, for example, that the word "compression" in the first
paragraph here can serve as a source both for the prefix "com" in the
word "common" later in the paragraph, and for the word "compression"
in this paragraph.</p>
<p>However, is it worth it?  It imposes the cost of indicating the length
on the "caller", which seems like it might be dumb.  Consider if
instead we had</p>
<pre><code>'LZ77 '
X { Y { 'com' } 'pression' }
' uses ... nes can'
Z { ' share a '; call Y; 'mon' }
'tail by having...nes" can'
call Z
'\n*head* as well'
</code></pre>
<p>In this approach, there's still a count, but it's in the "callee"
rather than the "caller", so the expense of storing it is amortized
across callers.  Here I've written it as a "}" terminator rather than
a count.  And you can see that we don't lose the ability to use common
prefixes, but we don't save anything unless a particular backreference
is used more than once.</p>
<p>But what is the tradeoff?  It depends on how exactly we do the
storage.  If we actually use a "RET" terminator, then we can share
tails for free, just as in machine code.  But nesting isn't free:
either we need a matching start marker, or we need to replace nesting
with an explicit call.  X above can't be represented just as 'com' RET
'pression' RET; otherwise when you called it, it would return too
soon!  </p>
<ul>
<li>It could be represented as { { 'com' } 'pression' }, which gives you
  suffixes like "om" and "ession" for free, though not "ompression",
  at the cost of needing both begin and end markers.</li>
<li>Or X could be represented as Y 'pression' RET, with Y defined
  earlier outside of the main flow, but the extra invocation of Y is
  probably larger than the begin marker.</li>
<li>Or, instead of using a terminator, we could just put the count into
  the begin marker: "9:3:compression", counting the initial 3-letter
  string as a single element of a 9-element sequence.  This loses the
  ability to share tails for free.</li>
</ul>
<p>With any of these three possibilities, you also now have the
possibility of representing the distanceback with an index into a list
of defined subroutines, rather than a number of bytes back.  This
should save a number of bits from the distanceback, effectively
enabling much larger windows.</p>
<p>This is a relatively obvious tweak to LZ77, so it's probably been
tried before.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
