(2 minutes)</div><p>Let’s say some color component, say red, is a linear function of pixel
position (x, y) in some region: rᵢ = a₀xᵢ + b₀yᵢ + r₀.  This is an
arbitrarily oriented linear gradient.  Now, if we α-blend this red rᵢ
with some other red rⱼ painted over it with some opacity α, we get
rₖ = (1 - α)rᵢ + αrⱼ.  This gives us a new gradient:</p>
<pre><code>rₖ = (1 - α)(a₀xᵢ + b₀yᵢ + r₀) + α(a₁xᵢ + b₁yᵢ + r₁)
   = ((1 - α)a₀ + αa₁)xᵢ  +  ((1 - α)b₀ + αb₁)yᵢ  +  (1 - α)r₀ + αr₁.
</code></pre>
<p>That is, the three components of the gradient (r, a, b) blend
according to the alpha-blending equation just as if they were colors.
Except really they are nine components; in some sense a linear
gradient is a transformation matrix from (x, y, 1) space into
(r, g, b) space.  These matrices then react to alpha-blending in the
same way that individual color vectors do: (1 - α)M + αN, at least if
this α is constant and not a gradient as well.</p>
<p>This means that if we have several layers, each of which is divided
into disjoint regions, each painted with a linear gradient with a
constant alpha, we can compute the intersection regions of the
single-layer regions in different layers, and compute the resulting
gradient for each of those intersection regions, then render the
resulting gradient.</p>
<p>For things like drop shadows, it would be nice to have gradients of
alpha, as well, so that things can be gradually feathered into
complete transparency.  Linear alpha multiplied by a linearly varying
color gives us a quadratic gradient.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
