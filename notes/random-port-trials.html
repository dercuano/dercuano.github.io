(2 minutes)</div><p>Symmetric NAT is a tricky problem for peer-to-peer applications.
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15038468">Ierymenko says</a> you can get 96% success in establishing
connections if you do port prediction, but also that you can succeed
eventually with random port trials because there are only 65535 ports.</p>
<p>The idea is that A and B send a pair of UDP packets to each other at
the same time (on the mark of some third party) and have a 1/65535
chance of happening to guess the correct UDP port for the other.  So
if they do this once a second, they will succeed on average in 18
hours, at an average cost of 65535 packets per party.  The time to
success takes an exponential distribution.</p>
<p>I was thinking that perhaps you could increase your success by sending
larger batches of packets, so that each packet has a larger “target
size” to aim at, but that only makes sense for full-cone and
address-restricted-cone NAT, which can be tackled by easier techniques
anyway.</p>
<p>The purely random approach can still work faster than one packet per
second.  16 packets twice a second should be feasible in most cases,
which should take 2048 seconds on average.  As long as this doesn’t
crash your NAT or disrupt your existing connections, which should be
detectable, the expected bandwidth is (20 bytes IP header + 8 bytes
UDP header) * 65536 = 1.8 megabytes, roughly the same as loading one
extra web page.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
