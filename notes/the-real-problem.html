<p>A dear, admirable friend of mine recently wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, [I agree that Facebook doesn’t want to fix their fake news
problem].  But the real problem [with the virality fake news] is
people not turning to real journalism anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several assumptions that I think underlie this statement,
all of which are incorrect:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real journalism exists, or used to exist, as a thing that provides
   reliable information.</li>
<li>Reliable information can make a person adequately informed about
   the world.</li>
<li>Humans who are adequately informed about the world will make good
   political decisions.</li>
<li>Good political decisions by voters will result in good government.</li>
</ol>
<p>I may, of course, be misunderstanding his point of view; but, absent a
better alternative for now, I will proceed to rebut my interpretation
above.</p>
<p>If any one of these four is false, then the link from “people not
turning to real journalism anymore” to good government is a false
trail.  Here I explain why all four of them are false, but if you find
my arguments on one of these four points unconvincing, please have the
patience to consider whether at least one of them receives its quietus
here.</p>
<h2>Journalism has never provided reliable information</h2>
<p>Journalism, since its 17th-century inception, is done by people who
are ignorant about the topic they are writing about; they learn enough
about the topic to be able to explain it authoritatively to others,
but their explanations are nearly always ridiculous to anyone knowledgeable
about the topic.  Worse, journalists are only allowed to explain
things that are timely — which is the time when the least is known
about them.</p>
<p>This has resulted in journalists clothing all manner of ridiculous
lies in the solemn garments of Received Wisdom, with the lightest
dusting of background information generally cribbed from some other
recent article on the subject.</p>
<p>(Maybe you remember the period when dozens of articles mentioning the
World Wide Web described it as “the graphical section of the
Internet”, when of course the internet does not and did not possess
sections; the World Wide Web was not and is not graphical but
primarily textual; and many graphical applications that are not Web
browsers also ran on and run on the internet.  The only way such
nonsense could propagate is if each ignorant journalist copied it from
an earlier one.)</p>
<p>Journalism’s standard of exceptionality as a factor of newsworthiness
also undercuts its reliability, as is widely observed; famously, it
has led many people to imagine that commercial airline flight in the
US in the 1970s and later was much more dangerous than driving,
because plane crashes are exceptional, while car crashes are not.</p>
<p>This makes journalism, even when it achieves its highest standards, as
in Consumer Reports, extremely poor as a source for information.  But
journalism has never frequently achieved its highest standards.  Most
journalism has always been schlock.  The Pulitzer Prize is named after
a yellow journalist noted for his sensationalism and unconcern for
veracity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even when reliable information is available, reading it
has never been very popular; novels have always been much more
popular.  This seriously limits the possible readership of a would-be
provider of reliable information — the kind of people who think a
5,000-word article is a “long read” are never going to obtain much
information about anything outside their direct personal experience.</p>
<p>This has gotten worse in recent years as newsrooms have cut their
budgets, but it was always thus: in the 17th century when journalism
began, when Hearst arguably launched the
Spanish-American War,
when reporters interviewed me in my childhood,
when Crichton formulated his famous Gell-Mann Amnesia effect in 2002,
when the New York Times
shrank from calling torture “torture” for a decade, and today.</p>
<h2>Reliable information is not enough to adequately inform you about the world</h2>
<p>But suppose that the information you get is reliably correct.  Instead
of reading conceited ignorants parroting the misunderstood words of
whatever expert they were able to talk to, you can instead read the
brilliantly expressed, deeply knowledgeable analysis of the world’s
leading experts on a topic, which furthermore is carefully contextualized
and prioritized so that you aren’t left with big holes in your knowledge.
This would be like reading a good textbook on a
subject, instead of the low bar journalism aspires to reach and almost
invariably fails at, because of the structural problems I described above.</p>
<p>And let's suppose, improbably for nearly all humans,
that you actually do read the whole thing.
Is this enough to make you informed?</p>
<p>No.  If you read a textbook and do not do the exercises, you still do
not gain the understanding that the textbook author attempted to
convey to you.  You cannot become informed about a topic merely by
reading about it.  You must practice it.</p>
<h2>Adequately informed humans still often make terrible decisions, even in politics</h2>
<p>The catalogue of human folly is limitless.  Many humans smoke several
cigarettes per day, thus making a decision several times a day that
they know will likely cause them to die in agony while those they love
most watch helplessly.  We have all seen humans neglect important
parts of their lives until they fell apart — a marriage, a diabetic
condition, a leaking roof, their own illiteracy.  We all waste our
money sometimes, from the poorest to the richest.  Procrastination is
a universal experience, though some are harder hit than others.</p>
<p>Humans do not decide their actions intellectually.  They decide
emotionally.  Their thoughts affect their emotions, and vice versa.
But their thought and beliefs do not determine their actions.  Much of
the time they invent justifications for their actions after the fact.
Salesmen and other negotiators spend enormous attention on modeling
the emotional reactions of their prey, even more than they spend on
modeling their prey’s incentive structures.</p>
<p>All of this applies to politics as well.  Informing humans — even when
it is possible to do so — often merely provides them with further
justifications for their existing belief systems, which (especially
for allistic humans) are determined mostly by their social milieu, not
by their own attempts to think based on the information they have
access to.</p>
<h2>Good political decisions by voters are not adequate for good government</h2>
<p>If the candidates are corrupt, the government will be corrupt,
regardless of which one the voters choose.  If the officials, once in
office, are confronted by perverse incentive structures in their
institutions, even good officials will produce bad government.  And
Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem places strong limits on how good a
voting system can be.</p>
<p>Institutions matter.  Voting is not enough.  Consultation matters.
Expertise matters.  Low-quality elites don’t become high-quality
elites by competing for votes.</p>
<h2>None of this means voting and journalism are useless</h2>
<p>The popular vote is still the most important safeguard against the
kinds of disastrous policies that led India to famine after famine
under colonial administration, that led the US to commit genocide
against the Native Americans, and that kept a substantial fraction of
the US’s population in chattel slavery for generations.  If Indians,
Native Americans, and African Americans, respectively, had had the
vote, these things would not have happened, as clearly shown by the
end of slavery.</p>
<p>And even the very rotten kind of information that journalism provides
at its best can still be valuable when it’s about current events,
where no better information is available.</p>
<p>But let’s not mythologize “real journalism” or create unachievable
expectations for it.</p>
