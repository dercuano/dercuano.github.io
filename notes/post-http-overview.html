<h1>Stuff I've posted to kragen-tol over the years about post-HTTP</h1><div class="metadata">Kragen Javier Sitaker, 2014-02-24
(12 minutes)</div>
<p>I've argued that we need a browser that supports accessing resources
stored in decentralized content stores like Tahoe-LAFS or Git, rather
than named according to a path defined by the administrator of a
particular domain name over time.  I haven't done a very good job
of gathering my thoughts on the matter into one place yet.</p>
<p>This all seems a little silly, given that other people have contributed
so much more to solving this problem than I have, but there may be one
or two things in here that aren't currently easy to find, but that are
important.</p>
<p>I've only dug through the archives back to 2000.  There might be stuff in 1998 or 1999
that's relevant, but surely not very important.</p>
<h2>Reasons why</h2>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2006-November/000841.html">"What's wrong with HTTP?"</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In this essay, the first of a pair on browser apps, I explore how
they are better than traditional desktop apps in some ways, but
worse in others.  Some of the disadvantages of browser apps are
deeply rooted in the use of HTTP URLs for naming.  In the second
essay, I will present a design sketch for a new platform, a
replacement for HTTP combining both styles' advantages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still haven't published the second half, and it needs thorough revision now.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2006-July/000818.html">"The equivalent of free software for online services"</a></h3>
<p>Explains why it's crucial to implement communication systems as cooperating software
running on users' computers, rather than on centralized servers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So people use free software because of its guaranteed low cost, because
it does what its users want, and because it's trustworthy.  And they use
web services because they get low system administration costs, they can
use huge databases without downloading them first, they can get software
updates quickly, they can do very-CPU-intensive things, and they can
collaborate with their friends easily.  How can we get both of these
sets of advantages at once?</p>
<p>I think there is only one solution: build these services as
decentralized free-software peer-to-peer applications, pieces of which
run on the computers of each user.  As long as there's a single point of
failure in the system somewhere outside your control, its owner is in a
position to deny service to you; such systems are not trustworthy in the
way that free software is. ...</p>
<p>So we need a platform, something like a web browser, that supports a
universe of constantly-changing code written by a multitude of authors,
which migrates to where it's being used, and simultaneously supports
individual control over what version of the code is running on your
system and no-hassle updating when someone else has a change you want;
that replicates your data transparently to other machines so that you
don't have a single point of failure, but without allowing the owners of
those other machines to spy on you or corrupt your data; that runs
programs in a high-level language; that supports conflicting updates to
different replicas of the data and allows a human being to resolve the
conflicts; and that makes it easy for you to share particular bits of
your code or data with anyone, everyone, or no one.  Maybe we could even
start with a web browser and add the other stuff to it.</p>
<p>If we don't build such a platform, we will eventually lose the
advantages of free software, because we will use web services instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's actually a lot of detail in this essay about specifically how you
could structure such a system.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2011-August/000938.html">"Why I do not want to work at Google"</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Google has an orientation that is opposed to my agenda. ...</p>
<p>I imagine a different future, where if Alice wants to talk to Bob and
Bob wants to talk to Alice, there’s no unaccountable intermediary that
can interfere with their communication, whether they’re speaking text,
or video, or 3-D models, or simulation.  If Alice’s email gets marked
as spam, Bob ought to be able to find out why — and fix it!  I imagine
a future where every human being can participate in creating the
culture they live in, without needing permission from anybody, and
without fearing repercussions. ...</p>
<p>I believe that warehouse-scale client-server computing will, in the
end, undermine the kind of democratic freedom of communication that we
need to deal with today’s global menaces.  It’s more practical than
peer-to-peer computing at the moment, but that pendulum has swung back
and forth several times over the decades.  (Some of my friends were
among the first employees of a hot cloud-computing startup, in 1964,
called Tymshare.)  The proper response to the current impracticality
of decentralized computing is not to sigh and build centralized
systems.  The proper response is to build the systems to <em>make</em>
<em>decentralized computing practical again</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Things contributing to building the solution</h2>
<p>There's a lot of software out there now that wasn't there when I wrote
this stuff; I should probably make a list of it here too.  See above,
too, the item about "The equivalent of free software for online services."</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2005-June/000784.html">"Imagine decentralizing Wikipedia with Codeville"</a></h3>
<p>Codeville was an early decentralized version control system, like Git or
Mercurial, that didn't take off.  Functionally the systems are equivalent:
they replicate the entire version history to every user and provide hash-based
retrieval.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So support for individual points of view amidst general disagreement
is one of the benefits of del.icio.us over dmoz or Yahoo, and it's
built into the architecture of the system --- it's not just a social
practice.  Could Wikipedia's architecture change to support divergent
points of view better?..."arch", darcs, monotone,
Codeville, git, and other decentralized version-tracking systems aim
to support a wider array of development models; in particular, they
aim to allow each person's tree to stand alone as a first-class
citizen, easily sharing its changes with other similar trees.</p>
<p>Imagine that we applied one of these systems to Wikipedia.  We would
have several benefits: tolerance of controversy, disconnected
operation, higher availability, and potentially organizational
decentralization.</p>
<p>We could tolerate controversy better because Holocaust deniers would
have their own version of Wikipedia, which they could modify to their
heart's content.  This would reduce their desire to modify the
Wikipedia that everyone else reads, but it would not eliminate it.</p>

<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2005-April/000769.html">"DHTML persistence: a design for a generic Ajax server-side"</a></h3>
<p>Probably the first essay I wrote advocating what we were doing at KnowNow in 2000,
which kind of went mainstream in 2004 with Gmail and 2005 with Google Maps:
putting all the application logic on the client side in JavaScript, relegating the
server to basically being a dumb data store.  Once you do this, of course, you no
longer need a server as such; you need a dumb data store, which can be provided by
a peer-to-peer network — but this essay doesn't talk about that at all.</p>
<p>I'm not convinced that I actually achieved a usable protocol design here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my view, the most sensible thing to do is to write the application
entirely in JavaScript from the beginning and run it all on the client
side.  Doing this prevents you from having to rewrite bits from time
to time, and puts the application code on the machine of its user, who
can then use bookmarklets and Greasemonkey to customize its
functionality.</p>

<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2012-November/000968.html">"Decentralized chat using CouchDB"</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I was just chatting with Noah on IRC about how IRC sucks and we need
to replace it and whether we could do that using CouchDB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More broadly, what's needed for decentralized secure chat, which is to say, 
pub/sub, or event notification.  Pub/sub is one of the fundamental services
needed for distributed, including decentralized, applications.</p>
<p>CouchDB is one of the current systems that contemplates Lotus-Notes-style
mobile-code secure applications, which it calls CouchApps.  Unfortunately,
I think the discussion that followed this email showed that it's not
capable of providing the kind of support for secure collaboration that we
need — its security model is too simple.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2004-October/000767.html">"distributed posting list joins"</a></h3>
<p>One of the hardest problems in decentralized systems is how to query a decentralized
database with acceptable efficiency.  In this post, I finally found a solution that
allows you to build a <em>distributed </em>if not decentralized full-text web search engine.
This followed some work in <a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2004-February/thread.html">http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2004-February/thread.html</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2004-January/000749.html">"rumor-oriented programming"</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we want to build a distributed application with automatic
change synchronization.  Here's a persistence system with coordination
functions somewhat similar to mod_pubsub or Linda, but specifically
designed for replicating the state of an application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually wrote some things kind of like this, but never built the full system
described.  In fact I never finished describing it :(  But it's kind of like
CouchDB or Meteor.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2011-August/000935.html">"Peer-to-peer overlay networks are a bad idea on a DSL-based internet."</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Peer-to-peer overlay networks are inefficient on ADSL networks.  ADSL networks
are almost twice as efficient as SDSL networks.  Better alternatives require
redesigning the physical layer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2010-March/000910.html">"mailing lists, blog posts, and Git: what to do next with kragen-tol?"</a></h3>
<p>Lamenting that neither Git nor the Web provide distributed autentication
of publication date, which is a thing I want for kragen-tol, which is why
kragen-tol is still a mailing list.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2008-July/000900.html">"web services, operations as a strategic advantage, and decentralization"</a></h3>
<p>Suggesting that if we can decentralize web services onto individual users'
machines, then maybe we'll be able to reduce deployment headaches.  In retrospect,
I think this is kind of a dead end — instead we have devops — but it contains 
the concept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because the software runs on its users' machines doesn't mean
it can't be providing a networked service; consider BitTorrent or
Skype or, for that matter, Sendmail, ircd, or INN.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2007-April/000858.html">"the end-to-end principle in human society: scholarly writing and freedom of speech"</a></h3>
<p>Describes web browsers as "mere conduits" for information; suggests
content-centric networking.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2006-November/000840.html">"offline web reading"</a></h3>
<p>Nothing earthshaking but does mention I was able to use Google Maps offline
with WWWOFFLE because of its RESTian architecture.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2005-May/000778.html">"lazy evaluation in a distributed system"</a></h3>
<p>Some notes on how to build an event-notification/pub-sub/cache-invalidation
system that supports decentralized operation --- for changeable resources
that live at an identifiable network node.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2002-February/000681.html">"level-triggered 'event notification': condition notification"</a></h3>
<p>More notes on event-notification and pub-sub systems.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2002-February/000683.html">"P2P resource discovery"</a></h3>
<p>I suggest storing current physical location information for mobile P2P nodes in a DHT,
so that you can route packets to them.  Really, that's it; you don't need to read the post.</p>
<h3><a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2002-January/000655.html">"distributed mailserver"</a></h3>
<p>How to build a fault-tolerant distributed SMTP/IMAP server, supporting mailing lists
(pub-sub!) using distributed transactions.</p>
