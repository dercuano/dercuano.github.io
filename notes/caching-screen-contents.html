(2 minutes)</div><p>Suppose I have a 1920×1080 screen that doesn’t always update, and I'd
like to cache tiles of it.  I could do it with quadtrees (11 levels
down to the pixel level, or 7 levels down to the traditional 16×16
tile size) or I could do it by simply dividing the screen into a flat
grid of tiles — tiles of 64×64 pixels, say, dividing the screen into a
30×17 grid.</p>
<p>Then, to redraw the screen in a kind of RESTful system, I could make
510 requests to a tile-rendering service, providing it with
information about what was on the screen.  For many uses, it would be
okay for these requests to take too long for the screen to fully
update in a single frame time.  You could imagine a usable system, for
example, where each 16.7ms frame only has time to refetch 50 of the
tiles: 340μs to merely revalidate the cache of a tile.</p>
<p>(As a point of comparison, httpdito on my laptop takes about 50 μs per
HTTP request, which would be not quite enough to redraw the screen.)</p>
<p>This would suck for watching a movie or mouse tracking, though, since
you’d have randomly 0–100 ms of latency (0–6 frames) for screen
updates, making your mouse pointer jitter all over the fucking place,
making movies unwatchable, and making real-time games utterly
unplayable.  But if you have some kind of cache invalidation protocol
that eagerly recalculates the tiles that have actually changed, you
could reliably keep your latency to a fraction of a frame and track
the mouse accurately.</p>
<p>Suppose we can improve somewhat on httpdito by using a binary protocol
and not forking and accepting new connections and get down to 10 μs
per request.  (0MQ can normally handle messages in under 1 μs.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
