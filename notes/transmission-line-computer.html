(7 minutes)</div><p>Reading <em>The Art of Electronics</em> I was reminded of a rumored
unpublished result I vaguely recall from somebody at Bell Labs in the
1990s to the effect that you can build a universal computer if you
have a single NAND gate.  Could you do something like this in practice
using a big coil of coax?</p>
<p>(Coaxial and fiber-optic delay lines are an existing commercial
product.)</p>
<p>Table 2.1, on p.74 (the 107th page) of the current edition of <em>The Art
of Electronics</em> is labeled, “Representative Bipolar Transistors”.
Almost all of them can switch at 100 MHz; the 2N3904/2N3906
“jellybean” is 300MHz.  But at c, an oscillation at 300MHz is 999mm.
Typical coax propagates signals almost nondispersively (is this close
enough?) at about half of c, so each meter of it could hold about four
bits of storage.  My 32768-bit benchmark for a practical computer
would then require about 16 kilometers of cable.  At 2.95mm (the
diameter of RG58 instrumentation cables) that’s 109 liters of cable,
which is a completely reasonable amount of cable to manage, but
somewhat costly.  </p>
<p>(Some RF-amplifier transistors in the table reach up to 4GHz, reducing
all of this by an order of magnitude.)</p>
<p>(With magnetostrictive torsion delay lines, you could reduce the size
of all this stuff by many orders of magnitude; if your wire transmits
shear waves at 2km/s, which I think is a reasonable ballpark, and is
0.3mm wide, each bit takes up about 300μm×300μm×3.33μm, so 32767 bits
is 109mm instead of 16km, nearly a milliliter of wire instead of
nearly a cubic meter.  It should be practical to have megabytes of
memory.  But nondispersive magnetostrictive delay lines require
special stress-relieved spring wire and magnetostrictive transducers,
both of which sound tricky to me.)</p>

is a hundred-foot (30.5 m) length of 50Ω 30V RG58 coaxial cable with
BNC connectors on the ends.  They sell it for US$57.49, which would
set the price of the above quantity of cable at US$30200.  I hope it's
cheaper in bulk!</p>
<p><a href="http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-610317920-cable-rg-58-cuerda-foam-nuevos-_JM">http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-610317920-cable-rg-58-cuerda-foam-nuevos-_JM</a>
is a roll of 100m of 50Ω RG58 coaxial cable without connectors for
AR$1583, which is just over US$100, so the cost would be about half of
what I said above.</p>
<p>If all of this cable were in a single length, the bit-circulation
latency would be about 55 μs (32768 bits of 1.67 ns each), but in
practice you would probably want to have at least some modest amount
of parallelism; some sort of ideal compromise would be to have
something like 128 cables each containing 256 bits with a circulation
time of about 427 ns.  You probably also want to have some diversity
of cable lengths; for example, if the main cycle time is 256 bits, you
might want some cables of 255, 254, 252, 248, 240, 224, 192, 160, 96,
and 32 bits delay times, allowing nonlocal interaction.</p>
<p>Another reason for wanting shorter delay lines is that the lines are
lossy; the cable I linked above is specced to attenuate at 138dB/km at
100MHz.  That means that the 100-foot (200ns, say) cable attenuates by
about 4.2dB.  Your jellybean transistor might have a β between 25 and
150, which means that a single one of them can recover from over 30dB
of signal loss and maybe up to 44dB.  So 200ns or 400ns of delay line
at a time is fine, but if you get up over about 200 meters (700 ns)
you might start to need a repeater.  At some point you're going to
start having SNR problems.</p>
<p>What would the logic design for such a machine look like?  I’m
thinking of the delay line as containing a number of separate state
machines (something like 128 to 4096 of them), each of whose has a
state represented in a set of parallel bits in the different cables,
one bit per cable; each of them goes through a single state transition
every time it cycles through the state-transition active circuitry
that they all share.  The circuitry is entirely capable of latching
some amount of state from one machine to the next; this constitutes an
output from the previous machine, and an input to the next.</p>
<p>By itself, this is adequate to implement simple machines like the
rule-33 or rule-110 cellular automata.  But we can surely build a
machine that’s easier to program and more efficient than those are.
The “nonlocal communication” strange-length links I mentioned above
are one useful enhancement: they link these virtual state machines
into a much more densely connected topology than the ring topology
inherent in the temporal sequence of the delay lines.  (If you could
only pick a single extra length, rather than the eight I suggested, it
should be the square root of the total number; for example, if there
are 1024 state machines, each with 32 bits of state, this extra
network link should have a delay time of 32 or 992, enabling a message
to be routed from any machine to any other in at most 64 hops with an
average of 32.  The logarithmic network would cut this to a maximum of
10, at the cost of needing ten odd-sized links instead of one.)</p>
<p>(I should read about what Turing’s Pilot Ace and the LGP-30 were like,
since they had some of this nature.)</p>
<p>On the Pilot Ace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main store of the machine used ten delay lines each holding 32
words of 32 bits. There were also six temporary stores implemented
as short delay lines each capable of holding a 32-bit number.</p>
<p>The operations of the Pilot ACE allowed the programmer to specify
move operations from one delay line to another. This was achieved by
waiting for the number to come round and then "gating" it into the
data flow of another delay line. Because it was arranged so that the
numbers emerged from the delay lines at the same moment you could
only move the nth number in a delay line to become the nth number in
another delay line.</p>
<p>If you wanted to change the order of numbers in the long delay lines
you had to first transfer the number to a short delay line and then
wait for the position in the destination to come round. This made
programming more like juggling.</p>

<p>32 to 128 bits is not enough space to program a very complicated state
transition function.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
