<p>The extended version of Euclid’s algorithm due to Aryabhata
(the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADaka">kuṭṭaka</a>
(कुट्टक) or “pulverizer” algorithm) explains how to find
the coefficients <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>
such that <em>sa</em> + <em>tb</em> = gcd(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>).  Except I
don’t understand the explanation, so I am going to try to work through
an example.</p>
<p>Given 1247 and 1624.</p>
<pre><code>1624 - 1247 = 377  ∴ 377 + 1247 = 1624
1247 - 3·377 = 116 ∴ 116 + 3·377 = 1247
377 - 3·116 = 29   ∴ 29 + 3·116 = 377
116 - 4·29 = 0     ∴ 4·29 + 0 = 116 ∧ gcd(1624, 1247) = 29
</code></pre>
<p>So now I can try to express 29, the GCD, as linear combinations of the
values on the other lines.  The first one is already done:
29 = 1·377 - 3·116.  The previous pair was (1247, 377).  How can we
get 29 as a linear combination of those?  We know that
1247 = 116 + 3·377, but how does that help?</p>
<p>Oh!  The thing that helps is actually the other direction:
116 = 1247 - 3·377, which we can use to eliminate the 116 from
377 - 3·116 = 29, rewriting it as
377 - 3·(1247 - 3·377) = 29; 377 - 3·1247 + 9·377 = 29;
10·377 - 3·1247 = 29.</p>
<p>Then we can do the same thing again to re-express 29 from a (1247,
377) basis to a (1624, 1247) basis, because 1624 - 1247 = 377.
10·(1624 - 1247) - 3·1247 = 29; 10·1624 - 10·1247 - 3·1247 = 29;
10·1624 - 13·1247 = 29.</p>
<p>This is useful for finding multiplicative inverses, which only exist
in the multiplicative group modulo n for numbers relatively prime to
n.  In this case, if we divide by 29, we find that 10·56 - 13·43 = 1,
so modulo 56, -13 (=43) and 43 are multiplicative inverses, and modulo
43, 10 and 56 are.</p>
<p>So after all these years I understand how to find multiplicative
inverses efficiently in a Galois field.  At least a Galois field of
prime order.</p>
<p>If a multiplicative group order is a prime <em>n</em>, then you can also find the
multiplicative inverse by taking to the power <em>n</em>-2, by Fermat’s Little
Theorem, so, for example, 56⁴¹ % 43 = 10.  But that doesn’t work in
general for multiplicative groups of any order: 56⁴² % 44 = 12, but
because 56 and 44 have a common factor of 4, 56 has no multiplicative
inverse in ℤ/44ℤ; 43⁵⁴ % 56 is 1, which not its multiplicative inverse
in ℤ/56ℤ, because 1 is always its own multiplicative inverse.  43 is,
as I said, its own multiplicative inverse in ℤ/56ℤ, and the pulverizer
algorithm can compute this just as well without the extra confounding
factor of 29:</p>
<pre><code>56 - 43 = 13;
43 - 3·13 = 4;
13 - 3·4 = 1
= 13 - 3·(43 - 3·13) = 10·13 - 3·43
= 10·(56 - 43) - 3·43 = 10·56 - 13·43
</code></pre>
<p>Can I formalize this algorithm?  The forwards-backwards ordering seems
to suggest recursion; we could perhaps try to define a function
egcd(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) → (<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>g</em>) such that <em>sa</em> + <em>tb</em> = <em>g</em> and <em>g</em> =
gcd(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>).  The base case of the recursion would be, I suppose,
that <em>a</em> % <em>b</em> = 0, in which case a valid answer is (0, 1, <em>b</em>).
Otherwise, we have <em>q</em> = <em>a</em> // <em>b</em> and <em>r</em> = <em>a</em> % <em>b</em>, so <em>a</em> - <em>qb</em>
= <em>r</em>, and we need to recurse with <em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>g</em> = egcd(<em>b</em>, <em>r</em>).
Assuming that succeeds somehow, we have <em>sb</em> + <em>tr</em> = <em>g</em>, so we can
deduce that <em>g</em> = <em>sb</em> + <em>t</em>(<em>a</em> - <em>qb</em>) = (<em>s</em> - <em>tq</em>)<em>b</em> + <em>ta</em>, so
we can return (<em>t</em>, <em>s</em> - <em>tq</em>, <em>g</em>).</p>
<p>In Python:</p>
<pre><code>def egcd(a, b):
    q, r = divmod(a, b)
    if r == 0:
        return 0, 1, b

    s, t, g = egcd(b, r)
    assert s*b + t*r == g
    return t, s - t*q, g
</code></pre>
<p>Applied, for example, to (70, 24), this gives -1·70 + 3·24 = 2, so in
ℤ/12ℤ, 35⁻¹ = 11⁻¹ = -1 = 11, and in ℤ/35ℤ, 12⁻¹ = 3, both of which
are correct.</p>
<p>They say it is possible to extend this algorithm to non-prime-order
Galois fields GF(<em>pⁿ</em>) where <em>n</em> &gt; 1 by using polynomial division, but I
do not yet understand that.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (123 notes)
