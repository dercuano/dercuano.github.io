(1 minute)</div><p>Numeric loops running over large arrays are among the easiest kinds of
code for JIT compilers to optimize.</p>
<p>Numba is a popular BSD-licensed Python library for LLVM code
generation for numerical code; among the things it can do are to
compile graphs of Numpy array operations into efficient machine code,
including GPU code.</p>
<p>However, Python itself doesn’t have a general JIT compiler; Numba is a
limited-scope attempt at one.</p>
<p>JS does have a general JIT compiler, several of them actually
(SpiderMonkey, V8/Crankshaft, and JavaScriptCore).  It doesn’t,
unfortunately, have operator overloading.  But maybe building
computation graphs of arbitrary-dimensional arrays would be a
reasonable thing to do in JS; then you could compile them into JS
code, from which the existing JIT compilers could generate efficient
CPU code, and maybe you could write a new compiler to compile the
computation graph into GPU code, whether using WebGL in browsers or
something else.</p>
<p>An initial hack at generating numerical code for V8
(sweetdreams-js.js) yielded disappointing results.  But it was
straight-line, loop-free code, so it may not be applicable.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
