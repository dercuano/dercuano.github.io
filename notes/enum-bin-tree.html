<p><a href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Mirrored/AdvProgLangDesign/">Raphael Finkel's
book</a> says,
"Enumerating binary trees (see Chapter 2) is quite difficult in most
languages, but quite easy in CLU."  Of course I am not enthusiastic
about the idea that CLU has any merits not shared by my own favorite
languages, and so I am curious how hard it would be in, say, Python or
Scheme.</p>
<p>So, I thought, enumerating the binary trees of a particular size
should be fairly straightforward in Python:</p>
<pre><code># With a generator.
def enum_bin_tree(n):
    if n == 0:
        yield None
    for leftsize in range(n):
        for left_tree in enum_bin_tree(leftsize):
            for right_tree in enum_bin_tree(n - leftsize - 1):
                yield left_tree, right_tree

# With a multi-for list comprehension.
def enum_bin_tree_eager(n):
    if n == 0: return [None]
    return [(left_tree, right_tree)
            for leftsize in range(n)
            for left_tree in enum_bin_tree_eager(leftsize)
            for right_tree in enum_bin_tree_eager(n - leftsize - 1)]

# With a simple nested loop.

def enum_bin_tree_simple(n):
    if n == 0: return [None]
    rv = []
    for leftsize in range(n):
        for left_tree in enum_bin_tree_simple(leftsize):
            for right_tree in enum_bin_tree_simple(n - leftsize - 1):
                rv.append((left_tree, right_tree))
    return rv
</code></pre>
<p>Or in Scheme:</p>
<pre><code>(define (enum-bin-tree n)
  (if (= n 0) '(())
      (mapappend (lambda (left-size)
                   (mapappend (lambda (left-tree)
                                (map (lambda (right-tree)
                                       (list left-tree right-tree))
                                     (enum-bin-tree (- (- n left-size) 1))))
                              (enum-bin-tree left-size)))
                 (iota n))))
(define (iota n) (iotaplus (- n 1) '()))
(define (iotaplus n rest) 
  (if (&lt; n 0) rest (iotaplus (- n 1) (cons n rest))))
(define (mapappend fn lst)
  (if (null? lst) '()
      (append (fn (car lst)) (mapappend fn (cdr lst)))))
</code></pre>
<p>Then I looked at Finkel's pseudo-CLU version; it is 24 lines, compared
to 14 for the Scheme version and 6-8 for the Python versions.
However, it happens to be very similar to the first (7-line) Python
version above; the only differences in the algorithm are the position
of the -1 and its use of side effects in place of constructing new
tree nodes.</p>
<p>A variant of the approach above can be used to enumerate the sentences
of a given length in at least some context-free languages; the tricky
part is making sure that the recursion terminates.  I think it will
work for grammars with no epsilon-productions and no cycles in which a
nonterminal can expand to itself A -&gt; A.  I'm not quite sure if it can
be expanded to include those languages; I'm pretty sure allowing the
cycles don't add any power (you can rewrite the grammar to an
equivalent grammar without them) but I'm not sure about the
epsilon-productions.</p>
<h2>Enumerating binary search tree keys</h2>
<p>Another example Finkel's book gives, which is perhaps more to the
point, is comparing two binary trees to see if their nodes have the
same value in inorder traversal.  This is very similar to the
samefringe problem, in that the recursive formulation of inorder
traversal is very straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>def inorder_traverse(fn, bintree):
    if type(bintree) is type(()):
        left, middle, right = bintree
        inorder_traverse(fn, left)
        fn(middle)
        inorder_traverse(fn, right)
</code></pre>
<p>A nonrecursive procedural formulation, on the other hand, is
considerably more opaque.</p>
<pre><code>def inorder_traverse_nr(fn, bintree):
    stack = [("node", bintree)]
    while stack:
        action, arg = stack.pop()
        if action == "node":
            if type(arg) is type(()):
                left, middle, right = arg
                stack.push(("node", right))
                stack.push(("visit", middle))
                stack.push(("node", left))
        else:                           # action == "visit"
            fn(arg)
</code></pre>
<p>And if you want to be able to get those items on demand, for example
so that you can compare them with the items being produced from
another such traversal, you end up structuring it into some objects:</p>
<pre><code>class Inorder_Iterator:
    def __init__(self, bintree): self.stack = [Node(bintree)]
    def next(self):
        if self.stack: return self.stack.pop().next(self)
        raise StopIteration
    def push(self, other): self.stack.push(other)
    def __iter__(self): return self
class Node:
    def __init__(self, bintree): self.node = bintree
    def next(self, stack):
        if type(self.node) is type(()):
            left, middle, right = self.node
            stack.push(Node(right))
            stack.push(Visit(middle))
            stack.push(Node(left))
        return stack.next()
class Visit:
    def __init__(self, val): self.val = val
    def next(self, stack): return self.val
</code></pre>
<p>By contrast, Python generators let you write this:</p>
<pre><code>def inorder_traverse(bintree):
    if type(bintree) is type(()):
        left, middle, right = bintree
        for item in inorder_traverse(left): yield item
        yield middle
        for item in inorder_traverse(right): yield item
</code></pre>
<p>That's 6 lines of code instead of the 19 of the explicit object
version.  Both are noticeably shorter, however, than the 25-line
pseudo-Simula version with coroutines that Finkel presents (in chapter
2, subsection 2, p.33, figure 2.8).</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
