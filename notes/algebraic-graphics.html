<p>I was thinking about how to model objects for 3-D printing in a more
flexible and generative way than OpenSCAD provides, and a very
interesting factorization of 3-D geometry occurred to me.  It falls a
little short of what I was hoping for, but it still seems like it will
be somewhat useful.</p>
<p>You can compose all the common primitive solids, plus a large number
that are not common in 3D graphics but commonly occur in the world,
from a small number of primitives, belonging to a smaller number of
types (in the programming sense of data types) and primarily function
composition.  Surprisingly, it might even be practical to compute
things with.</p>
<p>In particular, this approach derives lines, squares, circles, arcs,
ellipses, cubes (and parallelepipeds in general), helices, cylinders,
cylinder walls, cones (including frusta), spheres, ellipsoids,
paraboloids, logarithmic spirals, discs, cycloids, spirographs,
machine turning patterns, and tori from seven
or eight relatively powerful primitives, each in about two lines of
code.</p>
<p>I say this is "algebraic" in the sense that I'm defining a set of
primitive objects and operations on those objects that I think will
map to the domain I'm interested in in a useful way.  You could also
say that it's "algebraic" in that it represents the 3-D objects as
symbolic expressions containing variables that can be evaluated to get
coordinates.</p>
<p>This is derived from some work Nick Johnson and I a few years ago for
an algebra of two-dimensional paths for his sand-table plotter, which
drew aesthetically appealing patterns in sand with a ball bearing
controlled by a magnet below the sand.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>I haven't tested these.  See section "The algebra" for a brief

<h2>It's based on extrusion</h2>
<p>"Extrusion" is a relatively general way of adding a dimension to a
manifold.  If you have a point, or a set of points, extruding them
along some path gives you a curve, or a set of curves; and if you have
a curve, or a set of curves, extruding them along some path gives you
a surface, or set of surfaces.  (If the path is discontinuous, you may
discover points becoming sets of curves, or curves becoming sets of
surfaces.)  For example, you can rotate a point into becoming a
circle, and the circle into becoming a torus; or you can translate the
circle to make the wall of a cylinder.</p>
<p>A few years back, when I wrote a real-time 3D engine in JavaScript (XXX)
with the 2-D canvas, this was where I stopped: extrusion took as
parameters an object, a linear 3-D transform, and an iteration count,
and gave you back an object made by extruding the original object
through that transform an arbitrary number of times.  The result was a
kind of faceted crude approximation to a torus, although I should
really have twiddled parameters a bit to get some kind of more
interesting shape, like a spiral or something; if you wanted a finer
approximation of a torus, you could halve the rotation angle and
double the iteration count, and you'd have more facets with duller
angles between them.</p>
<p>You'd think you could use this approach with arbitrary 3-D
transformations, taking some kind of "square root" of the
transformation in order to make a finer mesh where needed.  This turns
out to be impossible because even a simple rotation transformation
has, in some sense, lost the information about its angle: if it's 0.1
radians around the z-axis, say, we have this matrix:</p>
<pre><code>[ [ cos 0.1 -sin 0.1  0  0 ]
  [ sin 0.1  cos 0.1  0  0 ]
  [   0        0      1  0 ]
  [   0        0      0  1 ] ]
</code></pre>
<p>and if you want "half" of that rotation, it's equally valid to use sin
and cos of 0.05, or of π+0.05; either one will work out to the above
matrix when you double them.  (The fundamental theorem of algebra
tells us that in general zⁿ = w has n distinct solutions for a given n
and w, and multiplying by a complex number is a subset of the
transformations we're interested in here.)</p>
<p>So to get a smoothly interpolable representation, we can't simply use
a structure of 12 real numbers; we need something that preserves more
information about the functional relationship between those numbers
and the parameter, or parameters, we'd like to interpolate.</p>
<p>So how can we get there from a relatively small and usable set of
primitives with reasonably tractable computation?</p>
<p>This extrusion operator relies on a terribly general notion of "path".
I mean, PostScript's "path" was already very general: it can be
discontinuous and either open or closed, but at least it was just a
one-dimensional manifold of two-dimensional points.  This notion of
"path" seems to be a one-dimensional manifold of twelve-dimensional
transformation matrices:</p>
<pre><code>[ [ x0  x1  x2  x3  ]
  [ x4  x5  x6  x7  ]
  [ x8  x9  x10 x11 ]
  [ 0   0   0   1   ] ]
</code></pre>
<p>where the twelve variables inside the matrix are some kind of
piecewise-continuous real functions of one real variable, t.  In some
sense you can see the [x3 x7 x11] column as specifying a path in the
more traditional sense, some kind of infinite sequence of points in
3-space, along which a point transformed from the origin [0 0 0 1]
could swoop and soar as t changes; the other 9 variables simply
describe how a thing moving along the path gets stretched, skewed,
rotated, and perhaps reflected.</p>
<p>If we make these twelve variables, instead, functions of <em>two</em>
parameters, we get a parametric surface, which we can sample as finely
as we desire.</p>
<h2>Linear real functions</h2>
<p>First, and most basic, let's consider the linear real function
y = mt + b.  You can compose this from two one-dimensional manifolds
in a variety of different ways; let's say:</p>
<pre><code>M(m) = mt + 0
B(b) = 0t + b
</code></pre>
<p>These two <em>could</em> be composed with one another, but it is more useful
to be able to add them (pointwise), because that lets us span the
whole mt + b space.  So the function πx + π/2 can be written as
M(π) + B(π/2).  These functions are closed under addition, but not
composition or multiplication.</p>
<p>If we consider transforming the interval [0, 1] through these
functions, we can see that they can be used to represent arbitrary
closed intervals on the number line; in this interpretation, the
function above represents the interval [π/2, 3π/2], for example.  Of
course there are an infinite variety of other possible
interpretations, but this is the one I will choose.</p>
<p>Frankly, though, this is a little silly; instead of M and B, I will
use a single function of two real arguments:</p>
<pre><code>I(x0, x1) = (x1-x0)t + x0
</code></pre>
<p>which I will write as:</p>
<pre><code>x0...x1
</code></pre>
<h2>Elementary paths</h2>
<p>So let's consider the general 3-D linear transform that changes over
time.  This is capable of scaling (nonuniform scaling and reflection),
skewing, rotation, and translation.</p>
<p>If we have rotations around two axes, we can get rotation around the
third by composing them; if we have rotations around all three axes,
we can get scaling along arbitrary dimensions by composing 90°
rotations with scaling along a single dimension; and skewing happens
if you use a non-90° rotation and then scale along a single dimension.
Finally, composing arbitrary rotations with translations along a
single dimension will give you arbitrary translations.</p>
<p>So we have four elementary "paths", in the sense of path I described
earlier — not just a point that varies with some parameter, but a
general linear 3-D transform that varies over time:</p>
<pre><code>X(v) = [ [ 1    0       0    0   ]
         [ 0  cos v  -sin v  0   ]
         [ 0  sin v   cos v  0   ]
         [ 0    0       0    1   ] ]

Y(v) = [ [ cos v  0  -sin v  0   ]
         [   0    1     0    0   ]
         [ sin v  0   cos v  0   ]
         [   0    0     0    1   ] ]

TX(v) = [ [ 1 0 0 v ]
          [ 0 1 0 0 ]
          [ 0 0 1 0 ]
          [ 0 0 0 1 ] ]

SX(v) = [ [ v 0 0 0 ]
          [ 0 1 0 0 ]
          [ 0 0 1 0 ]
          [ 0 0 0 1 ] ]
</code></pre>
<p>So what is this v?</p>
<p>You could think of e.g. T as being the entire X-axis, or X as being
infinite rotation around the X-axis, in the sense that for any real
value of v, they represent a particular real 4×4 matrix that
translates the origin to that point on the X-axis or rotates to that
angle around the X-axis.  And if you take some interval of real
numbers [v0, v1] and transform it through T or X, you get some
interval of translations along the X-axis or rotations around it.</p>
<p>In particular, if we draw our v from the linear real functions
described in the previous section, then as t varies from 0 to 1, these
elementary paths will interpolate continuously and smoothly over some
interval.</p>
<p>We can multiply these matrices to compose the 3-D operations they
represent.  This means we're multiplying these individual elements,
which may be linear functions of t or transcendental functions of
linear functions of t.  This will produce, unfortunately, relatively
general algebraic expressions as elements of the matrices, which in
the worst case can grow exponentially in the number of elementary
paths in the matrix product: each variable rotation introduces two new
transcendental functions of a potentially new linear function.  (It
should be clear that Spirograph patterns can be computed this way
easily, so you shouldn't expect much worst-case simplification.)</p>
<p>This is a bit of a disappointment, since I was hoping for something
that would occupy bounded space, or hey! at least linear space, after
an arbitrarily large number of operations.  Not exponential space.</p>
<p>I console myself with the thought that the alternative representation
is often a triangle mesh, and it's going to take a pretty big formula
to approach the amount of space a triangle mesh uses.</p>
<h2>Surfaces</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a curve defined as above, some arbitrary composition
of elementary curves, each parameterized by some interval of the real
number line; now we would like to extrude it into a surface, which
might enclose a volume.  We can do this by transforming it through
some other arbitrary curve, which can stretch and rotate and skew it
as needed; all of this can be implemented simply by matrix
concatenation, but with the variable t renamed to u in the extrusion
path.</p>
<p>This gives us a 4×4 matrix, 12 of whose cells are arbitrary algebraic
expressions in t and u, combined with numbers, sin, cos, addition, and
multiplication; but we probably really only care about three of those
cells, [x3 x7 x11], the ones that give us the coordinates to which the
surface has carried the origin.</p>
<p>You might want to transform a surface by composing a path with it, but
maybe not a path that depends on t or u; it's not clear what that
would mean to me.</p>
<h2>The algebra</h2>
<p>So we have five basic elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>I(x0, x1: real): interval; written as x0...x1</li>
<li>X(v: interval): path</li>
<li>Y(v: interval): path</li>
<li>TX(v: interval): path</li>
<li>SX(v: interval): path</li>
</ul>
<p>And two, or arguably three, ways of combining them:</p>
<ul>
<li>compose(a: path, b: path): path; written as a . b</li>
<li>extrude(a: path, b: path): surface; extrudes a by moving it along b;
  written as a * b</li>
<li>extrude(a: surface, b: path): surface (or solid); makes two copies
  of a, one at each end of b, one of them with its polarity flipped,
  and connects them with a surface where the edge of a passed as it
  moved along b.  Effectively this involves turning the edge of a into
  a path and extruding that path as it moves along b.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Maybe instead: extrude or construct interval with ":", construct
interval with "@", apply functions with simple concatenation or ".",
compose with simple concatenation, ",", or ";", extrude with "/"?  I'm
ending up with lots of noise in my expressions.  Maybe also use
lowercase.)</p>
<p>Internally, this builds trees of the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>an expression is one of:<ul>
<li>a variable, t or u</li>
<li>a real</li>
<li>(a: expression) + (b: expression)</li>
<li>(a: expression) * (b: expression)</li>
<li>-(a: expression)</li>
<li>cos (a: expression), or</li>
<li>sin (a: expression). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an interval is an expression.</li>
<li>a path is 12 expressions.</li>
<li>a surface is 3 expressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could restrict this further, since e.g. the argument of a
transcendental function here will always be a linear one, but that
doesn't seem to offer much benefit yet.</p>
<h2>Computations on the surfaces</h2>
<p>The simplest and most obvious thing you might want to do is to sample
the points on a surface to build a triangle mesh, which you can do by
just evaluating the expressions for the surface points for different
values of t and u.  The range for t and u is predefined as [0, 1], so
it's just a matter of figuring out how much and where to subdivide the
range.</p>
<p>That's a bit of a problem, though.  You'd maybe like to keep your
sampling mesh more or less uniform in density, so as to avoid wasting
triangles on areas without much detail.  (On a sphere, for example,
there will surely be a point where one or the other of the parameters
doesn't give you any extra information.)</p>
<p>You can use bounding-box arithmetic ("interval arithmetic") to find
3-D bounding boxes of parts of the mesh, recursively bisecting the
mesh until your 3-D bounding boxes are small enough that
you are satisfied with your triangle size.  Interval arithmetic is
explained in a section below.</p>
<p>Additionally, for smooth shading (Gouraud or Phong), vertex normals
can be helpful.  You can calculate these by partially differentiating
the surface vector with respect to t and u and normalizing the cross
product.</p>
<p>Calculating the area of a surface may be useful for some purposes:
maybe for paint coverage or heat loss or adsorption or something.
It's reasonably feasible to approximate numerically with a simple
double integral over the parameter space.</p>
<h2>Interval arithmetic</h2>
<p>This is a sort of abstract interpretation of numerical formulas,
introduced to me
as an exercise in SICP, using [min, max] pairs to produce a
conservative approximation of a function's range over some interval.
For our case, we can use the following evaluation rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>a constant number k becomes [k, k]</li>
<li>[a, b] + [c, d] = [a+c, b+d]</li>
<li>-[a, b] = [-b, -a]</li>
<li>[a, b] * [c, d] = [a<em>c, b</em>d] if all four are nonnegative; otherwise,
  use identities to transform the expression into the tractable
  all-nonnegative form above:<ul>
<li>-[a, b] * [c, d] = -([a, b] * [c, d]); apply if a and b are nonpositive</li>
<li>[a, b] * -[c, d] = -([a, b] * [c, d]); apply if c and d are nonpositive</li>
<li>-(-x) = x; apply if possible</li>
<li>[a, b] = union([a, 0], [0, b]) if a and b have opposite signs;
  apply if possible</li>
<li>a * union(b, c) = union(a * b, a * c); apply if possible.  If
  this is applicable, you need to start again from the top because
  probably one of the new multiplication subexpressions contains a
  negative-going interval.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>union([a, b], [c, d]) = [min(a, c), max(b, d)] (remember,
  conservative approximation!)</li>
<li>sin [a, b] may be:<ul>
<li>[sin(a), sin(b)] if a and b are in the same monotonically
  increasing interval of sin;</li>
<li>[sin(b), sin(a)] if a and b are in the same monotonically
  decreasing interval of sin;</li>
<li>[min(sin(a), sin(b)), 1] if a and b have a peak between them;</li>
<li>[-1, max(sin(a), sin(b))] if a and b have a valley between them;</li>
<li>[-1, 1] if a and b have both a peak and a valley between them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Analogously for cos [a, b].</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are conservative, but they are precise in the sense that
if you subdivide a bounding box into smaller and smaller parts,
eventually the bounding box of a union-free formula evaluated over it
will have an arbitrarily small range.</p>
<p>Applying these evaluation rules to the three expressions that give the
x, y, and z coordinates of points on a surface, with interval values
for t and u, will give you a bounding box in x, y, and z for that
subsection of the surface.  If you use [0, 1], you get a bounding box
for the whole surface.</p>
<p>I write these bounding boxes as [a, b] rather than a...b because the
meaning of the second is slightly different, but confusingly similar:
it's a motion from a to b that varies linearly with t, while [a, b]
might oscillate wildly between a and b as t and u vary, perhaps not
even reaching them.</p>
<h2>Possible extensions</h2>
<p>Given a third parametric parameter, you could animate an unchanging
object along a path.</p>
<p>CSG — union, intersection, and especially subtraction — would
dramatically increase the power of the system.  It might be
particularly tricky to compute precisely, though.</p>
<p>Piecewise functions would enable you to do things like splines.  You
could imagine a sequence(a: path, b: path) operator (perhaps written
"a; b") that evaluated as a(2t) on [0, ½) and then b(2(t-½)) or
perhaps a(1)+b(2(t-½)) on [½, 1].  I think that the
extrude-a-surface-into-a-solid functionality kind of depends on doing
this anyway, since the resulting surface is a sort of composite of six
different surfaces: the initial and final surface and the four
surfaces produced by extruding the t=0, t=1, u=0, and u=1 edges.
(Alternatively you could make a "surface" be an arbitrary set of
parametric surfaces rather than just one.  Also this is making me
think I should read Wouter's CUBE engine.)</p>
<p>Piecewise functions potentially introduce a finite number of
discontinuities, and many things might then need to get a list of
discontinuities in an interval.</p>
<p>Being able to read in geometry from external sources (STL files, DXF
files, Hershey fonts, SVG logos, TrueType fonts, heightfields) would
enable a lot more stuff.</p>
<p>Being able to query geometrical results, KSeg-style or AutoCAD-style,
or even just PostScript-style (flattenpath, pathbbox, charpath,
pathforall), would make parametric modeling a lot more reasonable.</p>
<p>If you're just generating an STL file for 3-D printing, the shape is
all you need.  But for other purposes (displaying onscreen, using in a
game, 3-D printing in color) you need a way of adding other
attributes to your material.</p>
<p>Another thing you might want to do with a surface, besides look at it
or extrude it into a solid, is to "shell" it — build up a solid around
it of a given thickness.  This is analogous to the "stroke" or
"strokePath" operation in 2-D graphics.  I call it "shell" because if
you use it on a surface that encloses a solid volume, the result is a
hollow shell of some thickness.  (CATIA calls it "shell" too.)</p>
<p>The approximate inverse operations of "shell" are "fill" (remove
hollow spaces inside of) and "erode" (known as "inset" in Inkscape;
take a given thickness off the surface all the way around).</p>
<p>What are the equivalents of line dash patterns or halftone patterns in
PostScript? Maybe honeycomb (and other) infill, or surfaces perforated
to save plastic in 3-D printing?  Maybe embossed surface texture?</p>
<p>I want to be able to query the volumes of enclosed or nearly-enclosed
spaces for acoustic reasons.</p>
<p>In general it seems like repeating shapes could be useful.  Like if
you have an ellipsoid and you want to make sixteen of them evenly
spaced.</p>
<p>Perlin noise or midpoint-displacement surface roughness might be
useful things to have; but how do you add things like that in a clean
way?</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/math.html">Math</a> (78 notes)
