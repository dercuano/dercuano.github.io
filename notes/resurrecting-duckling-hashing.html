(8 minutes)</div><p>Tonight I was reading <em>Software Abstractions</em>, by Daniel Jackson,
Michael Jackson’s son. and came across the specification of a
hotel-room rekeying protocol that uses only keycards to communicate
between the hotel front desk and the door locks.  When it is desired
to rekey the lock, thus locking out the previous “guest”, the front
desk issues a new key; the battery-powered lock can recognize both the
current key and the new key, and upon recognizing the new key, it
updates its “current-key state” to refer to that new key.</p>
<p>This is vaguely reminiscent of the problem [Stajano and Anderson] set
out to solve: “secure transient association of a device with multiple
serialised owners”, the “owners” in this case being the hotel
“guests”, and the “device” being the door lock.</p>
<p>[Stajano and Anderson] https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/1999-StajanoAnd-duckling.pdf "The Resurrecting Duckling, 1999"</p>
<p>The keycard protocol is an ingenious approach, but it can be refined
further and applied more broadly.</p>
<h2>The weak protocol suggested in the book</h2>
<p>The suggestion in the book was that the lock could use, for example,
an LFSR to compute the “new key” from the “current key”.  This
approach is unnecessarily vulnerable to some attacks.  Most simply,
the “guest” could compute the successor of their own room key, and
after checking out, come back to rob the new occupant.  Slightly more
annoyingly, they could compute the successor of the successor, and not
only rob the new occupant but also lock them out.  Furthermore, they
could extend this attack arbitrarily far into the future, computing
keys far into the future.</p>
<h2>A better protocol</h2>
<p>Given a one-way function, instead of computing a <em>successor</em> key, the
door lock can recognize a <em>predecessor</em> key.  It compares the
presented key PK contents to its “current key” CK, opening if there is a
match PK = CK; if that fails, it computes a one-way function of the presented
key H(PK) and compares <em>that</em> to the current key.  If there is a match H(PK) = CK, it
updates its current key to be the new key, thus locking out the old
key.  (This “comparison to the current key” could be achieved by way
of a salted KDF such as bcrypt() so that even with knowledge of the
lock’s memory contents, however acquired, it is infeasible to
fabricate even a current key.  That is, instead of storing CK,
the lock would store some salt S and CKK = KDF(CK, S), and instead of
comparing PK = CK, it would compare KDF(PK, S) = CKK.)</p>
<p>To initialize the lock, the front desk generates and stores a hash
iteration count <em>N</em> of, say, a billion, and a random bitstring R; it
hashes the bitstring <em>N</em> times — K[0] = R; K[1] = H(K[0]);
K[2] = H(K[1]); ... K[N] = H(K[N-1]); and sets the lock’s “current key” CK to
the billion-hashed version K[N], and then it erases all of K except <em>N</em> and R.
To generate the new
key, the front desk decrements <em>N</em> and repeats the computation, thus
producing a key that will rekey the lock.</p>
<p>The crucial factor here is that the initial <em>N</em> should be large enough
that we will not run out of keys before the door lock (or other
device) needs to be repaired for some other reason, at which point it
can be reinitialized.  Even 9999 is likely sufficient for a hotel-room
door lock.</p>
<p>As I understand it, this is more or less the OPIE or S/KEY approach,
and it’s probably in Merkle’s dissertation, which I haven’t read yet.</p>
<h3>Performance optimizations</h3>
<p>If the direct approach of performing nearly a billion hashing
operations per rekey is too slow, it is straightforward to cache
hashes K[<em>N</em> - 1], K[<em>N</em> - 2], K[<em>N</em> - 4], K[<em>N</em> - 8],
and so on, such that the
amortized average number of hashing operations required per rekey is
just under 2, at a logarithmic space cost — 30 keys for this
example.</p>
<p>Most of the cache space is used for the last few levels — if you
could afford a million hashing operations per rekey, you could cache
only 10 keys instead of 30, still getting a thousandfold speedup over
the cacheless case.  That is, from a certain point of view, 99.9% of
the speedup comes from 33.3% of the cache.</p>
<p>As usual, in exchange for a higher space cost, the amortized bound can
be made into a worst-case bound.  The first rekey operation consumes
the cached key <em>N</em> - 1 and computes keys <em>N</em> - 3 and <em>N</em> - 7; the
second rekey operation consumes <em>N</em> - 2 and computes keys <em>N</em> - 6 and
<em>N</em> - 5; the third consumes <em>N</em> - 3 and computes <em>N</em> - 15 and <em>N</em> -
14; the fourth consumes <em>N</em> - 4 and computes <em>N</em> - 12 and <em>N</em> - 11;
the fifth consumes <em>N</em> - 5 and computes <em>N</em> - 10 and <em>N</em> - 9; the
sixth consumes <em>N</em> - 6 and computes <em>N</em> - 31 and <em>N</em> - 30; and so on.
In this case the space cost becomes linear if we pay only two hashing
operations per rekey, which is likely unacceptable.  I think that if
we pay four hashing operations per rekey, we can keep the space cost
logarithmic, though still up to twice the space cost of the
amortized-only algorithm.</p>
<h2>Reverse metempsychosis and imprinting an ignition key</h2>
<p>[Stajano and Anderson] suggest that an IoT device should “imprint on”
or “be ensouled by” the first public key it receives when it hatches;
this allows the owner to establish a relationship with it that its
manufacturer cannot participate in.  The rekeying protocol plays the
role their paper calls “escrowed seppuku”, allowing the manufacturer
to command the duckling to die and prepare to be ensouled anew.</p>
<h2>Extension to further applications</h2>
<p>Because this protocol only depends on the strength of a hash function,
it’s a good candidate for being resisting quantum cryptanalysis, which
is good news, since Google has just announced that they have
demonstrated quantum supremacy.  But in the form above it can’t do
very much; it can’t even authenticate any other information on the
keycard, such as the “guest”’s checkout date or public key, since that
other information would break the hash chain.</p>
<p>Suppose that instead of computing the keys by merely hashing their
predecessor, we additionally generate a private-key seed D[0], and
compute a series of private-key seeds D[1], D[2], ... D[N] from it by
the recurrence D[I] = H(D[I - 1]), as we were doing before with the
room keys.  And suppose we have some computation A to generate a
public key from one of these private key seeds: Q = A(D[I]), which
perhaps also generates a private key into the bargain.  Now, instead
of computing the new room key as K[I] = H(K[I - 1]), we compute that
key as K[I] = H(K[I - 1] || A(D[I])), and we put both K[I] and A(D[I])
on the keycard.  The verification step changes accordingly.</p>
<p>Now, however, the room lock can verify both the newly presented key
and this other datum A(D[I]), which it does not understand and
therefore could not have used to verify that it was used to derive the
A(D[I + 1]) that it previously held.  The front desk, however, can
perhaps use the corresponding private key to sign other attestations
that the room lock can verify, at least until its next reverse
metempsychosis.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
