and it talks about how the top 1% in intelligence are responsible for
a lot of our science and culture.  Some controversial previous
discussion has focused on how differences in variance and means
between different groups might affect questions like this; Larry
Summers got fired over such discussion, for example.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_intelligence">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_intelligence</a>
summarizes the situation.</p>
<p>The top 1% are 2.33 standard deviations to the right of the mean in a
Gaussian distribution, which is 135 IQ in the overall population:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; qnorm(.99)
[1] 2.326348
&gt; qnorm(.99, mean=100, sd=15)
[1] 134.8952
&gt; pnorm(135, mean=100, sd=15)
[1] 0.9901847
</code></pre>
<p>What if you have a subpopulation with a 10% smaller variance?  It
turns out to reduce the number of people in that subpopulation in the
top 1% by more than a factor of 2:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; pnorm(135, mean=100, sd=15*.9)
[1] 0.9952372
</code></pre>
<p>What if instead you have a subpopulation whose mean is shifted down by
one standard deviation, without changing the variance — an effect size
of 1?  This reduces the number of people in that subpopulation in the
top 1% by a factor of 20:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; pnorm(135, mean=85, sd=15)
[1] 0.9995709
</code></pre>
<p>This is true even though the probability is quite reasonable that an
event from this group will be higher than an event drawn from the
entire population.</p>
<p>The situation becomes more extreme as you go to more extreme
quantiles.  Consider the top 0.01%:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; qnorm(.9999)
[1] 3.719016
&gt; qnorm(.9999, mean=100, sd=15)
[1] 155.7852
&gt; pnorm(156, mean=100, sd=15)
[1] 0.9999055
&gt; pnorm(156, mean=100, sd=15*.9)
[1] 0.9999832
&gt; pnorm(156, mean=85, sd=15)
[1] 0.9999989
</code></pre>
<p>That is, at IQ 156 and above, where we find 0.01% of the population, a
hypothetical population with a 10% lower standard deviation will be
underrepresented by almost 6:1, and a hypothetical population with a
1-SD-lower mean will be underrepresented by more than 90:1; getting
the same result by tweaking the variance requires a 21% smaller
standard deviation, 11.9 IQ points.</p>
<p>A hypothetical group with a 1-SD-lower mean but also a 21% <em>larger</em>
standard deviation (of 19 IQ points) matches and slightly exceeds the
overall population at this level:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; pnorm(156, mean=85, sd=15/.79)
[1] 0.9999077
</code></pre>
<p>In this context it is worth pointing out that tutoring improves
student performance by two standard deviations (Anania (1982, 1983)
and Burke (1984)):
<a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2012/09/23/tutoring_two_sigma">http://changelog.ca/quote/2012/09/23/tutoring_two_sigma</a>.</p>
<p>So what if we have a hypothetical group with an unchanged variance but
a mean two standard deviations higher?</p>
<pre><code>&gt; pnorm(156, mean=130, sd=15)
[1] 0.9584818
</code></pre>
<p>If student performance is equivalent to IQ, 4.2% of them will exceed
the performance of 99.99% of the rest of the population.  This is a
larger difference than has ever been suggested for (mean or variance)
intelligence differences due to race or sex.</p>
<p>(In the paper described, tutoring also substantially reduced the
variance of achievement scores, but this is probably because the
achievement scores had a ceiling; all three of the distribution curves
from the experimental data intersect at the X-axis on the right, and
the “tutorial” group’s distribution is noticeably skewed to the left.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/politics.html">Politics</a> (39 notes)
