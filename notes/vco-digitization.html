(5 minutes)</div><p>I want to build an oscilloscope out of recycled e-waste.  This is
problematic because parts like analog oscilloscope CRTs and 60Msps
ADCs are not common in e-waste, and parts like TV CRTs and 2Msps ADCs
are not adequate substitutes.  A 100kHz “oscilloscope” is a joke.
20MHz is the minimum standard, and for an analog scope, that’s just
the 3dB cutoff frequency; it can still detect signals of higher
frequencies, just attenuated and maybe phase-shifted.</p>
<p>Once I have a digitized signal, basically the hard part is over.
Everything after that is a simple matter of programming.  Digitizing
the signal fast enough is the hard part.</p>
<p>To be concrete, I want to be able to sample a signal to the following
specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>at a rate of at least 60 million samples per second;</li>
<li>at a resolution of at least 8 bits per sample;</li>
<li>for at least 2048 data points;</li>
<li>for at least two data channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Ideally I could do this many times per second, but I don’t think
that’s going to be a meaningful constraint.)</p>
<p>So I’ve been exploring a variety of different possibilities, and I
think I might finally have a design approach that will work.</p>
<p>To digitize a channel, you first use it to control eight separate
nonlinear VCOs with one-octave ranges and center frequencies
distributed around 350MHz.  At their lowest frequencies, they will be
around 250MHz; at their highest, around 500MHz.  The linearity of
their voltage- frequency response matters almost not at all for this
application; deviations from linearity of a factor of 2 or more can be
tolerated.  This should make it possible to use very simple, primitive
designs for the VCOs; something like the 5¢ MMBT6428 npn RF
transistor, with its 700MHz transition frequency, ought to be adequate
for each VCO.</p>
<p>The spread in frequencies among the VCOs prevents them from locking to
one another through unintentional cross-coupling.  This probably means
they’ll need to be spread apart by more than 15MHz (thus 120MHz
between the highest and the lowest), which I will disregard in what
follows, hoping it’s unimportant.</p>
<p>So now you have eight channels carrying waveforms, each of which is in
the 250MHz to 500MHz range, and which collectively have between 4 and
8 billion transitions per second.  This means that during a
17-nanosecond sample period (at 60Msps), they have between 65 and 133
transitions, depending on the input voltage and on how the phase of
each oscillator happens to line up with the sample period.  I think
you should expect rms noise of .82 counts per sample period from the
random phase thing,
compared to rms noise of .29 counts
for just quantizing at all (a factor of √8 smaller),
which means ENOB is lg(66*.29/.82) ≈ 4.5, which is inadequate, even before
some of those bits are spent on
tolerating nonlinearity.</p>
<p>(I think the above calculation is still wrong.  See
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_number_of_bits">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_number_of_bits</a>.)</p>
<p>Then you need to count these pulses.  If each channel is connected
through a MOSFET to a capacitor and a 500MHz ripple counter, we can
freeze the count by turning off the MOSFET and letting the ripple
finish, and then we can latch it by reading out the ripple count data
in parallel.  You just need the capacitor’s RC time constant with the
MOSFET to be well under 1ns, and its discharge time while driving the
ripple counter to be long enough to give us time to read the count
(say, 1μs).</p>
<p>A 500MHz ripple counter has a first bit that transitions at 500MHz, a
second bit that transitions at 250MHz, a third bit at 125MHz, a fourth
bit at 62½MHz, and then we’re down to ranges where any old ripple
counter will do.  But the first four bits of the counter might need to
be built with special care.</p>
<p>This requires us to transfer eight 8-bit transition counts (64 bits)
from the ripple counters to FIFOs every 17-nanosecond sample period,
probably not over a shared 8-bit bus, in order to keep the bus clocks
down at 60MHz instead of 480MHz. The FIFOs need to hold 2048 data
points (128 kibibits in total, 16 kibibytes), but don’t need to be
dual-ported.  Then we can read them at our leisure when we’re not
acquiring data.  For example, if we trigger a data collection 60 times
a second, we have 17 milliseconds to read the data out of the FIFOs,
about a microsecond per data transaction or 125 nanoseconds per data
transaction on a given FIFO.</p>
<p>It’s probably necessary to measure the temperatures of the VCOs in
order to compensate for thermal effects on their voltage-frequency
relationship.</p>
<p>Using larger ripple counters is probably a good idea because it means
you can get higher precision at lower sampling rates.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
