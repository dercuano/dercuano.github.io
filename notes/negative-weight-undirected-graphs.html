(8 minutes)</div><p>The classic shortest-path algorithms on graphs such as Dijkstra-Moore,
Floyd-Warshall, and Bellman-Ford are commonly applied specifically to
digraphs.  In particular, Bellman-Ford is much slower than
Dijkstra-Moore for graphs of any reasonable size, but is guaranteed to
be correct on a more general class of graphs --- those including
negative arc costs, but not negative cycles.</p>
<p>The usual reduction from weighted graphs to weighted digraphs replaces
each undirected arc with a pair of antiparallel arcs of equal cost.
Unfortunately, from Bellman-Ford's point of view, this transforms a
negative arc cost into a negative-cost cycle.  So, what's the best way
to find lowest-cost paths in a weighted <em>undirected</em> graph with
negative arc costs, but no negative cycles?</p>
<p><a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/300026/known-methods-for-mutexing-antiparallel-arcs-in-graphs">Manfred Weis discussed this in the Bellman-Ford context last
year</a>.  He found a transformation from an undirected weighted arc
into five directed arcs (three zero-weight) and two new vertices that
seems to have the right properties.  And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson's_algorithm">Johnson's algorithm</a> is
another known approach.  To my surprise, this seems to be a somewhat
active research area.</p>
<p>I thought it should be straightforward to modify the Floyd-Warshall
algorithm to handle this situation.  But now that I think about it
further, I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Floyd-Warshall, like Dijkstra-Moore and Bellman-Ford, proceeds by
successive relaxations, but those relaxations amount to adding a
possible intermediate node <em>k</em> to the set of all possible paths.  The
central step in Floyd-Warshall is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>d<sub>ij</sub></em> ← <em>d<sub>ij</sub></em> ∧ <em>d<sub>ik</sub></em> + <em>d<sub>kj</sub></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where ∧ is the binary minimum function.  This amounts to considering
whether the best known path from <em>i</em> to <em>j</em> can be improved by
chaining together the best known path from <em>i</em> to <em>k</em> with the best
known path from <em>k</em> to <em>j</em>; at the point that the algorithm does this
update, all paths through all nodes preceding <em>k</em> have already been
taken into account.  (So doing this update for a given <em>k</em> and all
<em>i</em>, <em>j</em> ensures that <em>k</em> and all the nodes before it have been taken
into account.)</p>
<p>That is, either node <em>k</em> isn't an intermediate node on an optimal path
from <em>i</em> to <em>j</em>, or it is; the two possibilities are handled by the
two operands of ∧.  In some sense, the possible paths Floyd-Warshall
considers between any two vertices are the powerset of all the
vertices.  In particular, this means that non-simple paths --- those
that visit the same node more than once --- are not contemplated,
except that a path is (in some sense vacuously) permitted to pass
through either or both of its own endpoints.</p>
<p>Let's consider 2-cycles, paths from some node <em>p</em> to some other node
<em>q</em> back to <em>p</em>, without any intermediate nodes.  These can only exist
in digraphs. (Cycles in either graphs or digraphs can only include the
same arc once.)  If our weighted digraph represents a plain weighted
graph in the way described above, the two costs are equal; if they are
positive, this cycle cannot form a part of any optimal path (since you
could improve the path by removing it), but if they are negative, they
form a negative-cost cycle that means that there is no shortest path
anywhere reachable from them.  But this does not carry over to the
original undirected graph: it may well have no negative-cost
undirected cycles, because the single undirected arc is not a cycle.</p>
<p>So, either way, if we're trying to apply Floyd-Warshall to an
undirected graph, we'd like to avoid considering these 2-cycles.</p>
<p>I thought I saw a simple way to do this, but now I'm not so sure.  I
thought it would be straightforward: just don't create paths from <em>i</em>
back to <em>i</em> with only a single intermediate <em>k</em>.  But now I see that
paths from <em>i</em> back to <em>i</em> that run through multiple intermediate <em>k</em>
nodes will necessarily start out as paths with only a single
intermediate <em>k</em>.</p>
<p>A couple of ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When you decide to overwrite an optimum cost using nodes prior to
    <em>k</em> with an optimum cost going through <em>k</em>, you could compute how
    many arcs are on that path; say, start with an array of path
    lengths <em>p<sub>ij</sub></em> entirely filled with ones, and when you
    update <em>d<sub>ij</sub></em> ← <em>d<sub>ik</sub></em> + <em>d<sub>kj</sub></em>,
    also update <em>p<sub>ij</sub></em> ← <em>p<sub>ik</sub></em> +
    <em>p<sub>kj</sub></em>, which may amount to either increasing it or
    decreasing it.  This enables you to add a special case: when
    considering updating a cost <em>d<sub>ij</sub></em> ← <em>d<sub>ik</sub></em> +
    <em>d<sub>kj</sub></em>, you can check whether either <em>d<sub>ik</sub></em> or
    <em>d<sub>kj</sub></em> is a length-2 cycle (i.e., the two coordinates
    are equal and <em>p<sub>kk</sub></em> = 2) and just not update in that
    case.</p>
<p>(There's an algorithm which stores the actual paths in rope form
rather than just their lengths, but if you want the paths rather
than their lengths, using ropes is no faster than the standard
next-pointer modification of Floyd-Warshall for path
reconstruction, and it needs more space.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But why bother with <em>p</em>?  Including cycles in your candidate
    optimal path is never beneficial: either they have positive cost
    and you can eliminate them, or they have negative cost and the
    optimal path fails to exist.  You could just decline to include
    cycles altogether by the simple expedient of not considering the
    possibilities <em>i</em> = <em>k</em> and <em>j</em> = <em>k</em>.  Then the algorithm will
    compute the lowest-cost <em>simple</em> path between each pair of nodes.</p>
<p>Well, not quite!  It turns out that it can still unintentionally
consider cycles in the following way.  Suppose that the
lowest-cost path from a to c goes through b, and the lowest-cost
path from c to d also goes through b.  If <em>k</em> = b before <em>k</em> = c,
in the b step, we will compute a <em>d</em><sub>ac</sub> and a
<em>d</em><sub>cd</sub> that each depend on going through b.  Later, in
the c step, one of the candidates we will consider for
<em>d</em><sub>ad</sub> is <em>d</em><sub>ac</sub> + <em>d</em><sub>cd</sub>.  If this
is cheaper than <em>d</em><sub>ab</sub> + <em>d</em><sub>bd</sub>, which can
happen if there's a negative-cost cycle between b and c, we may
take it.  The same logic shows that the approach in point 1 is
also flawed.</p>
<p>However, I assert without proof that it does still consider all
the simple paths, even if it considers some nonsimple paths as
well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the implementation of Floyd-Warshall I was using, which appears
to work in cases without negative-cost cycles:</p>
<pre><code>def floydwarshall(edges):
    V = {u for u, v, w in edges} | {v for u, v, w in edges}
    inf = float('inf')
    d = {(i, j): inf for i in V for j in V}

    for u, v, w in edges:
        d[u, v] = min(d[u, v], w)

    for k in V:
        for i in V:
            for j in V:
                d[i, j] = min(d[i, j], d[i, k] + d[k, j])

    return d
</code></pre>
<p>For reproducibility and to attempt the possibility #2 above, I
modified it as follows:</p>
<pre><code>def floydwarshall(edges):
    V = {u for u, v, w in edges} | {v for u, v, w in edges}
    inf = float('inf')
    d = {(i, j): inf for i in V for j in V}

    for u, v, w in edges:
        d[u, v] = min(d[u, v], w)

    # Sorted order so that cases where the algorithm doesn't give
    # incorrect results at least get repeatable results:
    for k in sorted(V):
        for i in sorted(V - {k}):
            for j in sorted(V - {k}):
                d[i, j] = min(d[i, j], d[i, k] + d[k, j])

    return d
</code></pre>
<p>I was generating the graphs to run it on with this routine:</p>
<pre><code>def randomgraph(n, m, o=10, p=1):
    rv = []
    existing = set()

    for i in range(m):
        u = v = None
        while u == v or (u, v) in existing:
            u, v = random.choice(n), random.choice(n)
        existing.add((u, v))
        rv.append((u, v, random.randrange(o)-p))

    return rv
