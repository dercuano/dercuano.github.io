(17 minutes)</div><p>Traditional mechanical analog “computers” represented quantities only
as displacements (sometimes linear, sometimes angular), but perhaps by
using other quantities such as strain (tensile and shear) and
velocity, we could construct simpler flexure computing devices that
compute faster.</p>
<p>Needless to say, such devices ought to be as small as possible given
the precision that is required; no advantage accrues to a calculating
device from requiring lots of power and weighing a lot.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that we’re stuck with the misleading term “computer”
for such analog devices, because in the digital realm, we do not call
an adder, multiplier, or decoder a “computer”; we reserve that term
for essentially Turing-complete digital systems.  But it is not even
clear what the analog equivalent of Turing-completeness would even be;
an “analog computer” is a set of building blocks that can be
reconfigured and connected together in different ways to perform
different calculations.</p>
<h2>Linear and nonlinear springs</h2>
<p>The equilibrium or steady-state configuration of a damped sprung mass
with a given force applied is a displacement that depends on the
force, but not the mass.  In some nonlinear cases, like Euler columns,
there may be more than one possible equilibrium configuration, even
without inelastic deformation.  (Merkle’s buckling-spring logic
depends on this for its memory; see <a href="../notes/mechanical-computers.html">mechanical computation: with Merkle gates, height fields, and thread</a> for
depth on such systems, and <a href="../notes/elastic-metamaterials.html">Elastic metamaterials</a> and
<a href="../notes/snap-logic.html">Snap logic</a> for some more related stuff.)</p>
<p>Hookean springs make this equilibrium displacement a linear function of
the applied force, or to look at it the other way, they make the force
a linear function of the displacement.  This means that if you have a
few different linear springs pushing on a single lumped mass, its
equilibrium displacement is going to be a weighted sum of the
displacements of the other ends of those springs.</p>
<p>Once any nonlinearity enters the picture, which can happen through
rotation (as in Euler columns), contact (as a plucked ruler hanging
off the edge of a table rattles against the tabletop), or maybe even
fluid dynamics, the equilibrium displacement–force relation becomes
not only nonlinear, but also potentially nonmonotonic, discontinuous,
and multivalued (i.e., not a function).</p>
<p>Considering continuous cases, though, let’s think about a cantilevered
beam of constant width tangent to a cylinder.  If you press it toward
the cylinder, it starts to wrap around the cylinder, shortening the
lever arm and increasing its Hooke constant.  By using a varying
curve, the increase of the Hooke constant can be tailored to the
integral of some arbitrary nonegative function.  You can thus get a
nearly arbitrary continuous displacement difference between two
parallel rulers wrapping around different-shaped curves under the
influence of two parallel coil springs from some remote source.</p>
<p>Additionally, Euler-column-style rotations can provide nonmonotonic
force–displacement relationships, though even without stiction, this
can result in memory.</p>
<p>Linearly converting a force to a displacement or vice versa can be
done with linear springs; computing an arbitrary nonlinear function of
a force as a displacement, or vice versa, can be done by the methods
described above.  Adding forces can be done by connecting multiple
springs to the same object.  In particular, it should be possible to
use two cylinder-wrapped rulers to compute the logarithms of two input
forces as positions, convert these positions back to forces through
much lighter linear springs which push on another object, and convert
its position to an exponentially increasing force by attaching it to a
third even lighter cylinder-wrapped ruler, which thus at equilibrium
computes the product of the input forces.</p>
<p>This suggests the ability to compute arbitrarily complex continuous
numerical functions, although clearly some kind of energy
amplification is necessary to prevent output “circuits” from unduly
loading the inputs and to permit chains of more than three or four
levels of depth.</p>
<p>These spring systems, like flexures in general (see <a href="../notes/flexures.html">Flexures</a>),
have no backlash as long as the material is perfectly elastic,
eliminating one of the major sources of error in mechanical analog
computation.</p>
<h2>Integrators and non-equilibrium systems</h2>
<p>In general, though, sprung-mass behavior does in fact depend on the
mass.  The net force on the mass, due to the curves of the various
springs acting on it and its current displacement with respect to
those springs, produces an acceleration inversely proportional to the
mass; the mass’s displacement is the integral of its velocity from its
initial position, and its velocity is the integral of its acceleration
from its initial velocity.</p>
<p>This suggests a much more appealing way of building a time-domain
integrator than the disc-on-plate and ball-on-plate devices used by
Bush’s differential analyzer: represent the time-domain quantity you
want to integrate as a force, and then the velocity of some mass gives
you its integral!</p>
<p>This has a couple of major disadvantages, though.  How do you convert
the velocity back into a force?  The usual mechanisms for this involve
either viscous fluid friction (which is notoriously tricky due to the
laminar–turbulent transition), or electrical generation, like old car
speedometers or eddy-current magnet braking.  And how do you exert a
controllable force on an object whose position is not an input to your
computation?</p>
<p>I propose that we represent the integral not merely as a velocity but
as a <em>harmonic oscillation amplitude</em>.  A tapered, cantilevered bar
will vibrate at some natural frequency, and its current oscillation
amplitude is roughly the integral of the oscillatory forces that have
been applied to it in the past.  The oscillations decay over time in
accordance with its Q factor, but Q&gt;100 routinely happens by accident
in oscillatory mechanical systems; I suspect this may provide
sufficient time to perform a useful calculation to the precision
afforded by the rest of the system.</p>
<p>If the cantilever is vibrating only in a single dimension, there are
times during its motion that all of its energy is elastic, and other
times when it’s all kinetic.  This seems like it could complicate the
process of continuously feeding energy into it from the quantity you
want to integrate; you need to feed in that energy in different frms
at different times.</p>
<p>A possible solution to this is to make it vibrate circularly in two
dimensions around its natural position.  With this approach, you can
always apply a displacement or force to it to add or subtract energy;
only the necessary direction of the displacement or force varies.
(And if you’re adding force, you need to add it in a direction that is
90° from the direction you’d need to add a displacement in.)</p>
<p>This has the possibility that you’ll end up with a non-circular
oscillation, because the signal you were adding had a periodic or
near-periodic component at or near the frequency you chose for the
oscillation.  To remove that effect, you can add the squares of the X
and Y component amplitudes.</p>
<p>To convert this oscillating integral value to a single-ended
displacement, you probably need to rectify it, ideally a tiny fraction
of it so as not to spoil the Q too much.  Rectification can be
achieved by the earlier-described kinds of nonlinear elastic systems
or more simply by banging shit together or trying to push on a rope.</p>
<p>Speaking of pushing on ropes, that may be a way to get the necessary
amplification.</p>
<h2>Amplification through Euler columns and loose string</h2>
<p>The crucial invention of Bush that made the differential analyzer
practical was not the integrator itself — that dated back
decades — but the “torque amplifier”, a negative-feedback friction
device that strongly drove an output shaft to the same position as a
weakly-driven input shaft.  How can we do something similar without
friction, backlash, wear, lubrication, and the other headaches of
sliding-contact machinery?</p>
<h3>Euler columns</h3>
<p>If you have a power-supply block that is being driven back and forth,
by your power supply, with some fixed displacement, and it is
connected to another block through a straight slender rod, it will
tend to drive that other block back and forth, unless the force needed
to drive the other block is so large that the rod approaches
Euler-column instability:</p>
<pre><code>_____       _____
|   |   ↔   |   |
| ↔ |-------| ↔ |
|___|       |___|
</code></pre>
<p>However, a relatively small force pushing on the side of the rod can
get it to buckle when it otherwise wouldn’t, greatly reducing the
force transmitted to the driven block:</p>
<pre><code>_____       _____
|   |   ↓   |   |
| ↔ |--___--|   |
|___|       |___|
</code></pre>
<p>The transverse displacement is relatively large (much larger than the
displacement that would have been transmitted to the driven block) and
oscillating, but the transverse force need do no net work over time.
Consequently you want to apply this displacement through a spring with
high compliance.</p>
<p>The column is shortened by this process, so I think the driven block
must also have relatively large compliance, at least at DC; if it’s
stiffly, I think it won’t work.</p>
<p>This provides a locally-continuous mechanism both for controlling a
large force with a small force and for controlling an arbitrarily
large amount of power with an arbitrarily small amount, like a MOSFET.</p>
<h3>Making straight string crooked and thus “loose”</h3>
<p>Possibly this can be generalized to adding slack to string by pulling
it sideways.  While the vertical “control string” is slack, as long as
the “drive string” is under some DC tension, it faithfully transmits
AC movements with high stiffness:</p>
<pre><code>__|__
↔   ↔
</code></pre>
<p>But if a little DC tension is applied to the control string, adding
some slack to the drive string, the effective stiffness of the string
drops greatly, and much less of the AC signal is transmitted:</p>
<pre><code>  |
 / \
/   \
↔
</code></pre>
<p>(For frequencies sufficiently high to require a transmission-line
model of acoustic propagation in the string, you also have to account
for reflection from the knot and the conversion of longitudinal waves
in the drive string into transverse waves in the control string.)</p>
<p>I think this may be the thread-based amplification construct I was
looking for when I wrote about computing with thread in <a href="../notes/mechanical-computers.html">mechanical computation: with Merkle gates, height fields, and thread</a>.  What I had come up with at the time was the
idea of frictionally clamping a thread running lengthwise down a dowel
by tightening another thread that ran around the dowel several times,
but I’m not totally convinced that’s a workable mechanism.  I’m more
optimistic about this new design.</p>
<p>I’ve rigged this up on the back of a chair with a couple of meters of
my knitting yarn, and pulling the control string certainly does
dramatically attenuate the AC <em>displacement</em> that gets transmitted
down the yarn.  However, it also adds tension to the yarn, so it’s
hard to tell whether it results in less energy being transmitted than
before; I don’t have a quantitative measurement of the force.  It also
has the effect of making my bedroom look slightly more like <em>A
Beautiful Mind</em>, and not the positive achievement parts.</p>
<p>Since this really only allows a DC signal to control an AC signal, you
need a rectification step to produce a fully composable analog
computation system made out of thread.  Thread is fantastic at
rectifying signals — as I said above, it’s a cliché that you can’t
push on a rope — but it’s even worse than electricity at having
memory, so you’re going to have a lot of ripple in your rectification
output.  For digital computation, you can probably deal with ripple in
a brute-force way if it comes to that — for example, separately switch
two phases of a quadrature signal and full-wave rectify both of them
into a single junction — but for analog “computation” it seems
like a big problem.</p>
<h3>Making loose string tight</h3>
<p>Much larger and clearer amplification is available easily with string,
though.  Although the above contrivance can possibly be made to work,
it has the major difficulty that it is trying to “loosen” string by
adding tension to it, so as to make it no longer straight and thus
less “stiff” to a power supply that’s trying to drive it.  Going at
the problem backwards, there’s a much simpler solution: try
transmitting a displacement signal by moving one end of a loose
string, and you will find that it doesn’t reach the other end, unless
the signal is so large as to pull all of the slack out; here <code>#</code> is
used to indicate fixed, solid material:</p>
<pre><code>#######
 |   |
_|   |_
↔|\ /|
 | v |
 |   |
#######
</code></pre>
<p>The slack string can attenuate an “ac power supply” by at least
several orders of magnitude.  (Here the vertical strings are “leaf
springs” whose tension provides a restoring force for the two knots
implicit in the diagram.)</p>
<p>But if something takes up the slack in the string, for example by
pulling it at right angles, the string suddenly begins to transmit
movement, although imperfectly:</p>
<pre><code>#######
 |   |
_|   |_
↔|\ /|↔
 | v |
 | |↓|
###|###
</code></pre>
<p>Some of the energy from the power supply is also transmitted to the
“gate string”, but I think it is possible to choose the angles and
compliances involved such that that energy is very small.  In
particular, if the slack “channel” string is nearly straight in its
slack state, the force applied to the “gate” string will be much
smaller than the force transmitted from the “drain” to the “source”
through the channel — say, ten times less — so if the gate and source
are of similar compliance, the interference energy backfed to the gate
could be around 1% of the energy successfully transmitted to the
source.  I am not sure about the energy needed to pull on the gate
string.</p>
<p>An even simpler nonlinear string mechanism is an “OR gate” consisting
of two input strings that can pull on a common knot, pulling an output
string if either of the two input strings is pulled:</p>
<pre><code>=====-----
  ↔
</code></pre>
<p>Direction change for a limited range of displacements is easily
achieved with a knot that can swing in a circular arc because it is
anchored to a fixed point:</p>
<pre><code>#
 \
  \______
  |   ↔
  |↕
</code></pre>
<p>Different parts of the arc provide different mechanical advantages
between the string chosen as input and that chosen as output; if the
arc is large compared to the expected displacements, this mechanical
advantage will be relatively constant.</p>
<p>“Negation” of displacements, when necessary, is available through a
sort of pulley mechanism made from two or three such direction-change
arrangements:</p>
<pre><code>#
 \
  \______
  |   ←
  |↓
  |______
  /    →
 /
#
</code></pre>
<p>But I think that, although these “OR” and “NOT” arrangements might
seem logically universal, they might lack some necessary kind of
amplification for full combinational logic, petering out somehow after
a few stages.  I think the right-angled-slack-string approach
described above, coupled with a power supply, should provide all the
amplification you could need.</p>
<h2>Stick-slip violin amplification</h2>
<p>Bowing a violin string tends to amplify existing vibrations in it;
when a transverse wave movement reaches the bow, it rips the string
free of the bow hair, causing it to slip, and when a peak or valley of
the transverse wave is at the bow, the string can stick to the hair,
which pulls it along and stretches it, adding energy that will be
released at the next slip.  This form of amplification is extremely
nonlinear, but might work.</p>
<h2>Amplification through multipliers</h2>
<p>As described above, a force multiplier flexure — where the output
force is proportional to the product of the input forces — is fairly
easy to rig up, although to avoid enormous imprecision, the vast
majority of the input energy remains as elastic energy within the
device, with only a tiny fraction reaching the output.  But that might
be okay if you’re multiplying a weak input <em>signal</em> by a high-power
power supply; it’s not really a problem if most of the energy in the
amplifier is resonating back and forth between the multiplier and the
power supply, or even just being burned up as heat, as long as the
output signal is stronger than the input signal.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this will work.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
