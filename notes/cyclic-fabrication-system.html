<p>“Cyclic fabrication system” is a term due to Moses, Yamaguchi, and
Chirikjian for, roughly, a fabrication system that can reproduce
itself — a self-replicating robot.  Such systems, once they exist,
will eliminate scarcity of many or most material goods, make
interplanetary mining an annoyingly ubiquitous reality, and convert
problems like global warming and asteroid strikes from existential
risks into manageable problems.</p>
<p>So how do we build one?  This depends in part on the environment
(terrestrial, space?) and the available materials (iridium, platinum,
water, aluminum oxide, carbon, iron, nickel, oxygen?).</p>
<p>I’m going to restrict my attention here to inorganic raw materials,
even though this body is typing this in an environment with a locally
high density of available organic materials with very nice engineering
material properties.</p>
<h2>Fired clay</h2>
<p>Fired clay is the fundamental technology for human-driven
(non-autonomous) terrestrial cyclic fabrication.  Although tools of
stone figure prominently in the human geological record, going back a
hundred and fifty thousand generations, we developed pottery some
fifteen hundred generations ago, and this is currently the basis for
all of human industry.</p>
