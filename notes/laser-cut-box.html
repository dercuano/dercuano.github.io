(2 minutes)</div><p>I bought a little plastic box with eight partitions for AR$49 at
Sodimac (US$3.10).  This seems expensive and I thought maybe I could
get an equivalent laser-cut for less.  Mina was skeptical.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the box are about 130 mm × 110 mm × 25 mm.</p>
<p>There is one partition running in the 130 mm dimension and four
partitions in the 110 mm dimensions, and there is a lid.</p>
<p>This works out to six partition edges and four face edges in the 130
mm dimension, thus 1300 mm, plus ten partition edges and four face
edges in the 110 mm dimension, thus 1540 mm, plus 15 vertical edges of
25 mm, thus 375 mm; a total of 3215 mm.</p>
<p>My current laser-cutting cost model is that laser-cutting goes 24 mm
per second and takes an extra 60 ms per vertex, and the cost is
US$0.026 per second.  Probably there would be about four vertices per
vertical edge, for a total of about 60 vertices, a total of only 3600
ms, not significant in the overall cutting time.  The 3215 mm would
take 134 seconds, plus another 4 seconds of vertices, a cost of
US$3.60.  So it would work out to be pretty much the same cost,
probably, or slightly more.</p>
<p>For larger boxes, I think the laser-cut MDF approach is definitely
cheaper.  Or if I can find someone who does cheaper MDF cutting.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/pricing.html">Pricing</a> (89 notes)
