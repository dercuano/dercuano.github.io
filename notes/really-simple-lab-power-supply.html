(7 minutes)</div><p>In <a href="../notes/lab-power-supply.html">Lab power supply</a> and <a href="../notes/bench-trash-power-supply.html">Bench trash power supply</a> I wrote
about adjustable power supplies for electronic benchwork.  But I think
I was overcomplicating the problem.</p>
<h2>Basic design: a PWM-controlled buck converter</h2>
<p>An AVR is sufficient for the control problem, though see below about
STM32s.  You can hook a couple of potentiometers up to it easily
enough as a user interface.  At some point you will want a screen to
see how much current is being drawn, but that's a rathole we can avoid
at first by way of using a USART.</p>
<p>To limit the output voltage you can rely on an ATX power supply's
high-current 12-volt output regulation; you can use a buck converter
consisting of a P-channel MOSFET, a freewheel schottky up from ground,
and a small inductor.  Such a device can have its voltage controlled,
even open-loop, with a PWM or PDM signal from the AVR.  Any random NPN
BJT will work as a gate pulldown driver unless you use a monster
MOSFET; switching frequencies in the tens to hundreds of kHz are not
demanding either on the gate capacitance or the microcontroller.  (To
drain 100 nC of Qg in 2 microseconds at 5 volts, you need a 100-ohm
pullup, so a 47-ohm pullup will work even for monster MOSFETs; using
such a high-current resistor would start to limit your options for the
BJT.)  Also most of the P-channel MOSFETs I've seen would work fine.</p>
<p>How much inductance do you need?  I don't know.  Not very much I
think.  Enough to avoid discontinuous conduction mode, I guess.  If
you use a too-big inductor you'll be fine except that you'll also have
to use a too-big capacitor to prevent voltage spikes when the load
comes unplugged.</p>
<p>A back-biased beefy rectifier from the output to the input will reduce
the risk that input-supply crowbarring will nuke the circuit if its
output is feeding voltage back into it (for example, because you were
charging a battery with it).</p>
<h2>Current sensing with a shunt</h2>
<p>Bench power supplies need current limiting, both because otherwise
it's too easy to get smoke, and because sometimes you want to test
things with a current source.  Typically an ATX power supply will do
some limiting, but not in a pleasant way.  Since you want to measure
the output current anyway, you might as well do the current limiting
in software.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to measure the output current but probably the
easiest is to use a precise sense resistor in series with the inductor
to measure the inductor current.  High-impedance voltage dividers from
the two ends of the sense resistors connect them to the
microcontroller's pins, and the difference between the two
measurements gives us our current measurement.</p>
<p>To be concrete about current sensing, say you're using an AVR with its
1.1V bandgap reference (1.0V to be safe) and its 10-bit ADC, and you
want to measure voltages up to, say, 13V, and currents down to 10 mA,
which is not a very ambitious milliammeter but probably adequate for a
quick-and-dirty power supply.  If your voltage divider is made out of
a 100-kilohm resistor and a 6.8-kilohm resistor, the full-scale 13V is
divided down to 844 mV, at most 865 counts on the ADC and at least (if
the bandgap reference is 1.2V) 720 counts; one count is thus divided
down from 18 mV, so you need at least a 1.8-ohm sense resistor, and
probably a 2.2-ohm sense resistor in practice.  Using such a big sense
resistor is an annoying limitation on how much current the power
supply could source at low voltages.</p>
<h3>STM32 possibilities</h3>
<p>Although an AVR would be adequate, an STM32 (see <a href="../notes/stm32.html">Notes on the STM32 microcontroller family</a>) would
be dramatically better; a 12-bit ADC means you could use a four times
smaller sense resistor (0.47 ohms), and the higher 1Msps sampling rate
means you can react more quickly to load changes and have more
confidence in the current measurement, which in turn means you can use
higher switching frequencies and smaller inductors and capacitors,
although at some point you start needing an active pullup for the
MOSFET gate, maybe a gate driver chip.</p>
<h2>Current sensing without a shunt</h2>
<p>Instead of using a shunt to sense the current you're charging the
output cap with, you could use two caps in parallel across the output
with a new switch between them:</p>
<pre><code>       L1          S2
____()()()()_______/._________ out
  |            |       |
 _|_           |       |
  ^  D1       === C1  === C2
 /_\           |       |
__|__        __|__   __|__
 ___          ___     ___
  _            _       _
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what to use for this switch, other than some kind of
transistor, but the idea is that you leave it closed almost all the
time, but occasionally you open it to find out how much current is
flowing.  The voltage across C2 will start falling, but C2 is in
parallel with the input capacitance of the load, and you don't know
what that capacitance is.  More useful is that the voltage across C1
will start rising, and the speed with which it's rising tells you the
current that's running through L1 at that moment.  If C1 is much
smaller than C2, say by a factor of 40, the rise in voltage will be
much faster than the fall on C2; if you leave the switch open long
enough for C1's voltage to rise by 25%, the voltage across C2 will
have fallen by 0.6%; and once you close the switch again the droop
will be instantly corrected.  (Oof, might want a little inductance or
resistance there to keep the switch from exploding from the
singularity.)</p>
<p>This is handy because, for a good current measure, you'd want C1 to
have a pretty precise and stable capacitance, and those are a lot
easier to find in lower capacitance values.  Electrolytic and
ferroelectric-ceramic capacitors have very imprecise capacitances.</p>
<p>This design can use one ADC pin instead of two, but I think it
requires two digital output pins instead of one.</p>
<h2>Basic BoM</h2>
<p>So, with the shunt design, that works out to a microcontroller, two
pots, seven resistors, a random inductor, a random capacitor, a
schottky, the protection rectifier, a P-MOSFET, and an NPN BJT, 15
non-microcontroller components.  And if you fuck up the firmware the
ATX power supply will probably save you but maybe not.  All of these
except the microcontroller can be easily scavenged.</p>
<p>You can hang a bunch of these puppies off a single ATX power supply if
they don't overload it.  You might be able to hang a bunch of them off
a single STM32; you need a couple of ADC input pins per power-supply
line.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
