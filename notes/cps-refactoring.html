(4 minutes)</div><p>Here I explain "<a href="">tell, don't ask</a>" in terms that explain when
and why it's valuable, without the resorts to metaphor and simplistic
heuristics often used in the teaching of object-oriented design.</p>
<p>One of the widely respected principles of object-oriented programming
is "Tell, don't ask."  In the unhelpful metaphorical language often
used to describe OO design principles, it is said that, rather than
asking objects about their state, you should tell them what to do:
send them a message, don't ask them a query.  Especially don't ask
them a query and then use the results of the query to decide how to
modify their state; if you're doing that, you should instead move the
logic into that object.</p>
<p>The problem with all of this is that, so stated, it doesn't have
enough context.  What are we trying to achieve with tell-don't-ask?
When might the drawbacks of telling exceed the drawbacks of asking, if
ever?  How can you tell when you've missed an opportunity to tell
instead of asking?  What do you do when you think you want the
benefits of tell-don't-ask but you can't figure out how to get telling
to do what you want?  That's what this post is about.</p>
<h2>CPS</h2>
<p>In the land of compiler implementation, especially the Scheme school,
tell-don't-ask is known as programming in "<a href="">continuation-passing
style", or "CPS</a>".  It turns out that, if you have
<a href="">polymorphic</a> method calls or <a href="">closures</a>, and you don't have a
stack-depth limit (or you have <a href="">tail-call elimination</a>) there is
actually no limit to the expressiveness of a program that never uses
any return values.  You can take a program written with return values
and transform it, completely mechanically, into a program where no
function has a return value.</p>
<p>In a sense, this is obvious: machine code doesn't, generally speaking,
have functions or return values, just subroutine call and return
instructions.  So to execute a program, a compiler must transform it,
mechanically, into a form that doesn't need return values.  Typically,
return addresses and function arguments are pushed onto a stack in
RAM, or stuffed into registers and then later placed on the stack.
There are various ways to think of the resulting process.  CPS takes
the position that the return-address and local-variable data on the
stack for the calling function is essentially a closure, which is
invoked as the last thing that the callee does.</p>
<p>This shows how to transform a function call into a CPS function call:
you take the rest of the caller, after the function call is to return,
and package it up into a closure that you pass to the function.  For
example, given this JavaScript function:</p>
<pre><code>function add_numbering(parent, domnode) {
  parent.numbering[parent.numbering.length-1]++;
  var number = parent.numbering.join(".") + ") ";
  insert_before(text(number), domnode.firstChild);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose we want to transform the concatenation of the trailing ") "
into CPS style.  It's an invocation of the built-in
string-concatenation operation <code>+</code>, which yields the return value we
are going to turn into a text node and insert into the document.  A
generic CPS version of <code>+</code> would take an additional argument that is a
closure to which to pass the concatenation result:</p>
<pre><code>function concat(a, b, k) { k(a+b) }
</code></pre>
<p>And we can make the transformation by packaging up the tail end of the
function like so:</p>
<pre><code>function add_numbering(parent, domnode) {
  parent.numbering[parent.numbering.length-1]++;
  concat(parent.numbering.join("."), ") ", function(number) {
    insert_before(text(number), domnode.firstChild);
  });
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you've used <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> this should look really familiar; Node
uses explicit continuation-passing style for I/O functions.  It does
this because one of the freedoms CPS gives you (to be listed later!)
is the freedom to suspend a computation and resume it later.</p>
