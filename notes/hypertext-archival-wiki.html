(3 minutes)</div><p>The pages you look at are deterministically executed code drawn from a
content-addressable store, using indirections through a namespace.
(So far, this is very much like Git.)</p>
<p>Code execution, since it’s deterministic, can have its outputs cached.
Ultimately what you need to see is a pixel image, so that's the
product of the final bit of code.  But it’s working from a variety of
inputs, and intermediate steps in the process can be cached.</p>
<p>The interaction with a page is structured more or less as in Redux: a
state is built up by applying a set of reducers to a sequence of user
interface events, and what you see on the screen is a function of that
state and stuff drawn from the content-addressable store.  In this
case, the user interface events are ultimately just keystrokes, mouse
events, and touch events.  But these are transformed into higher-level
events such as scroll events, button clicks, and text changes,
according to a sort of previous document state.</p>
<p>This approach allows a very small, stable computational core to be
extended to arbitrary interactive documents.</p>
<p>Because the code’s interaction with the files it draws upon (images,
libraries, etc.) is indirected through a namespace, you can get new
results from the same code by runnning it in a new namespace.  This
means that, for example, if you want to view an existing document with
a new font, you can make a modified version of it with the new font in
the relevant place in its namespace, where it used to find the old
font.</p>
<p>The blobs in the content-addressable store are simply sequences of
bytes.  The code’s access to items in its namespace is by way of
memory-mapping, and it has the option to view those sequences of bytes
in a variety of ways, including as arrays of integers.  The code’s
output is, similarly, some set of blobs placed in a particular part of
its namespace, found there when its transaction terminates
successfully.  This means that many jobs can be performed without
undergoing the overhead of serializing and deserializing data
structures.</p>
<p>Jobs cannot map new blobs into their namespace except by supplying
their contents; thus they cannot access any data they are not
initially granted access to, nor can they delegate such access to
other jobs.  This means that you can statically determine the entire
transitive dependency set of not only a given job but also all jobs
that could be launched from it via UI interaction.  This makes it
possible to securely archive the data necessary to run it, which means
that you can run it without risk of a failure due to data not being
available, and also means that you cannot </p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/archival.html">Archival</a> (34 notes)
