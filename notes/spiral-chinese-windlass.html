<h2>The standard Chinese windlass mechanism</h2>
<p>The standard Chinese windlass mechanism gets a very large mechanical
advantage from a simple mechanism by using a pulley as a differential:</p>

<p>Rope is wound in the same direction around two drums of different
sizes which rotate together, typically turned by a hand crank, or by
another wheel with an endless chain or rope or belt around it;
rotating the drums will always pay out rope from one and take up rope
from the other.  The rope runs down from one drum, around a
free-hanging pulley, and back up to the other drum.  So the pulley
moves up or down by half the difference in the rope paid out from one
drum and taken up by the other.</p>
<p>Through the magic of the differential mechanism, this very simple
mechanism provides an arbitrarily large mechanical advantage,
inversely proportional to the absolute difference in diameter of the
two drums.  If the two drums are equal in size, the mechanical
advantage is infinite.</p>
<p>To take a more practical example, if you want to lift two tonnes
(20 kN) by exerting 100 N on a 200-mm-radius crank, you need a
mechanical advantage of 200: a 2-mm difference between the two drums
will provide you with this.  (That’s in radius; it’s a 4 mm difference
in diameter.)  Perhaps one drum is 50 mm in diameter, while the other
is 54 mm in diameter, or perhaps one is 400 mm in diameter, while the
other is 404 mm in diameter (although it may be difficult to find such
a drum); the mechanical advantage is the same either way.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that we use a 50-mm and a 54-mm drum, or rather bar.
Each lifting revolution lifts the pulley by 2πmm ≈ 6.3 mm, paying out
π50mm ≈ 157 mm of rope from one bar and taking up π54mm ≈ 170 mm of
rope on the other bar.  Lifting the two-tonne weight by 2000 mm
requires some 320 turns of the crank, paying out 50.24 meters of rope
from one bar and taking up 54.4 meters of rope wrapped onto the other.</p>
<h3>Some difficulties with it</h3>
<p>This has the somewhat annoying result that you will need 55 meters of
one-tonne rope or webbing wrapped around your windlass to lift the two
tonnes by only two meters.  This rope might average 3 mm thick, and if
we want predictable mechanical advantage, it cannot freely wrap in
multiple layers — that would increase the effective diameter of the
windlass by 6 mm.  And we need about a meter of length of each drum,
since we need 320 turns of 3-mm rope, one right next to the other.
This has the rather dismaying result that our pulley hangs <em>down</em> by
two meters but <em>across</em> by half a meter relative to its attachment
point on each bar:</p>
<pre><code>-------------__________________

  \  big bar  /  little bar
   \         /   (with most of
    \       /     the rope)
     \     /
      \   / more rope
       \o/
</code></pre>
<p>This is going to put rather significant side forces on the rope that
will attempt to slide it along the length of the bar, add extra
tension to the rope that isn’t part of the load it’s bearing, and
change the mechanical advantage.</p>
<h2>The helical-grooved cone pulley</h2>
<p>So, the alternative I was thinking about is that, instead of two
drums, you can use a <em>single</em> tapered conical pulley with a single
spiral groove on it, and run the pulley between two near-adjacent
turns of the groove, one with a radius 2 mm greater than the other.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the groove is 3 mm wide, and there is a 16.5-turn
blank spot with no rope on it in between the takeup part and the
payout part.  This makes the blank spot 49.5 mm long and means that
the pulley tapers by 2 mm of radius every 49.5 mm of its length, an
included angle of 4.6°.  Because you still need 320 turns of rope, you
still need a meter-long tapered cone, but now it’s only one meter long
instead of two, or 1.01 m to be more exact.  Its radius at the wide
end is 40.8 mm greater than at the narrow end, and the pulley hangs
from two points that are only separated by 49.5 mm of length and, say,
40 to 80 mm of width.</p>
<p>(You might be able to squish adjacent turns of rope together a bit if
you skimp on making a full half-circle profile for the groove, or make
it a bit elliptical in cross-section, deeper than a perfect torus, I
don’t know.  Maybe you could shorten the apparatus by a third that
way.)</p>
<h2>High-precision movement</h2>
<p>There are three different reasons for wanting very large mechanical
advantages like the one provided by this mechanism.  The first,
discussed above, is to develop very large forces.  (<a href="../notes/tapered-thread.html">Tapered thread</a> discusses another very simple mechanism that does
this using a tapered helix.)  A second is precisely the
reverse — achieving very high <em>speeds</em> but low forces by applying
force to backdrive the mechanism through its stiffer part.  In this
case this is not applicable because the frictional losses are too
large, and this self-locking behavior is considered a feature in the
original use of the Chinese windlass to lower buckets down wells.  The
third is to achieve very high <em>precision</em> by precisely translating a
reasonable-sized movement, such as moving the crank by a millimeter,
into a much smaller movement, such as moving the pulley by ten
microns.  Differential screws are an analogous mechanism commonly used
for such high-precision movements.</p>
<p>With high-rigidity materials like <initialism>UHMWPE</initialism>,
this mechanism may be applicable to such uses, in particular in
parallel kinematics; the groove guiding the cable should reduce
uncertainty about where the cable is anchored to, and
hexapod-crane-type mechanisms can be considerably more rigid for a
given total mass than mechanisms that rely on resisting bending
moments over long distances.  Particularly with
<initialism>UHMWPE</initialism>’s high lubricity on steel, it may be
possible to dispense with the movable pulley and its bearings and
simply run the cable through a metal eye, but the bearings of the
conical drum will still be a source of error.</p>
<p>I worry, though, about the unknown and presumably load-dependent
amount of squish in the transverse dimension of the cable as it wraps
around the drum.</p>
