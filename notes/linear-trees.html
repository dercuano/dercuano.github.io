(6 minutes)</div><p>So I’ve been thinking a bunch lately about the Z-machine’s object-tree
memory model for embedded systems like the Arduino, as an alternative
to the usual C approach of nesting structs and arrays inside other
structs and arrays.</p>
<p>There are a couple of problems with the usual Lisp or ML memory model,
where all values are either pointers or fit into pointers, and can be
referred to from any number of places.  One problem is that you almost
need a garbage collector, which means that you can only use a fraction
of physically available memory for your data; a garbage collector that
collects garbage too often will use up the vast majority of your
system’s runtime.  This is a big problem if you have 2048 bytes of
memory available.  Another problem is that the garbage collector
imposes relatively large pauses on things — when you try to allocate
and the GC needs to collect first, you get a pause, which can be tens
of thousands of instructions long, even if you only have 2048 bytes of
memory.  A third problem is that the conditions under which your
allocation can fail are relatively poorly defined; fragmentation and
tenuring, among other things, can keep pieces of memory unavailable
that ought to be available, causing allocation to fail unpredictably.
A fourth, comparatively minor, problem is that the pointers themselves
occupy a lot of memory space, and they are usually a relatively
inefficient encoding of the facts about the world with which the
program must grapple.</p>
<p>The more subtle underlying problem is that, in some sense, if you’re
allocating memory at run-time instead of compile time, it’s probably
because you didn’t know how much memory you were going to need when
you wrote the program.  That, in turn, means that the program could
need more memory than is physically present.  And that’s true even if
you don’t use a garbage collector.</p>
<p>In desktop and server applications, where programs have error-handling
options that include popping up a dialog box with an error message,
notifying a user that they are exiting, paging a system administrator,
shedding load by dropping network requests without answering them, and
logging error messages in logfiles, the occasional failure is accepted
as a fact of life.</p>
<p>Embedded applications are different: their options for handling
failure are often limited to blinking an LED and rebooting.  Ideally
you would like your jet engine, robot arm, chemical plant, or antilock
braking system to simply not fail, rather than just having ways to
report the failure gracefully.</p>
<p>C has other options.  It inherits from COBOL, by way of Algol, the
possibility of hierarchically composing structs and arrays out of
primitive types and other structs and arrays; no pointers are
necessary.  C code for life-critical embedded systems is usually
supposed to obey a set of rules called MISRA, which, among other
things, entirely forbids the use of dynamic heap allocation.</p>
<p>However, C code to handle things made out of structs and arrays with
no pointers accommodates any kind of polymorphism only awkwardly, and
consequently exhibits very poor generality.  Common Lisp includes
generic functions like <code>concatenate</code>, <code>append</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>remove-if</code>,
<code>reduce</code>, <code>every</code>, <code>some</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>equal</code>;
the C++ STL includes generic algorithms like <code>copy_n</code>, <code>swap_ranges</code>,
<code>nth_element</code>, and <code>set_intersection</code>; Python code has at its disposal
generic dictionaries, lists, heaps, and sets.</p>
<p>It would be very desirable to program our embedded systems at a
similarly high level of abstraction and generality without paying the
heavy memory-efficiency and reliability costs imposed by the Lisp
memory model.</p>
<p>The Z-machine object containment tree seems like a possible candidate.
Each object contains three pointers: its parent, its first child, and
its next sibling.  (In the Z-machine itself, these were 16-bit object
indices; on the Arduino, 8 bits each would make more sense.  Also, it
might make more sense for only active cursors into the object tree to
carry the parent information, rather than every object.)  Rather than
destroying or creating objects, including by copying, our algorithms
can only move them around and mutate them.</p>
<p>Despite this, most of the Common Lisp generic functions immediately
make sense in the context of this rigid object tree.  It’s just that,
unlike most of their Lisp antecedents, they destructively consume
their inputs, and in some cases need to be directed as to where to
place their output.  The sorted set-arithmetic functions in
particular, except for symmetric difference, probably reduce to a
single <code>set_filter(comparator, targets, input, output)</code> subroutine
which moves all the objects from <code>input</code> that are equal to an object
in <code>targets</code> into <code>output</code>.</p>
<p>The hierarchical structure might prove valuable for persistence
support, where it could segregate persistent from nonpersistent
objects.</p>
<p>I suspect that this is related to linear or affine typing, as used in
Rust, but I don’t understand them well enough to really know.</p>
<p>There is a thing wrong with all of my analysis above.  It may be only
slightly wrong, but enough to make a difference.  It doesn’t really
account for function call stacks.</p>
<p>In the absence of recursive functions (and they should certainly be
absent if you want high assurance of no stack overflows) we could
certainly statically allocate the activation records of each function,
which would ensure no stack overflows.  But this is probably much more
costly than necessary; functions overlay one another’s stack frames in
a guaranteed-safe way (modulo uninitialized variables and taking the
address of local variables) and give a much tighter memory-usage
bound.</p>
<p>Can we extend this property in general?</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/c.html">C</a> (28 notes)
