(1 minute)</div><p>Suppose we have, as a fundamental unit, a simple finite state machine:
an asynchronous ROM with some address inputs fed from its own
registered output and other address inputs coming from elsewhere.  To
be concrete, consider the case where the ROM contains 256 8-bit words,
4 address lines attached to its own registered output, and 4 address
lines coming in from elsewhere.  The ROM contains 2048 bits; if it is
in fact programmable (for example by way of a serial bitstream) it
amounts to a programmable lookup table; it can plainly run quite fast.
What can we do with such a machine?</p>
<p>It’s straightforward to use it to hold 4 bits, or one decimal digit,
of an up/down counter; you can also use it as a 3-bit accumulator
slice, adding its input to its contents on each clock cycle, with
carry in and carry out.</p>
<p>However, upon further thought, I think this is probably not a useful
design; it necessarily contains upward of 4000 transistors, enough for
an entire 8-bit CPU.  The 256×8 configuration memory is surely better
off as 128 16×1 memories, as in a normal FPGA.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
