(1 minute)</div><p>You can think of radiosity rendering as something like seeking the
first eigenvalue of a transformation matrix; each vector element
identifies the luminous flux at a particular point in space oriented
in a particular direction.  The transformation matrix identifies the
transformation function of this six-dimensional light field as it
propagates through space and bounces off objects, along with whatever
sources of illumination are needed.  This vector must necessarily be
of very high dimensionality in order to provide a reasonable
approximation, but it may be possible to do a reasonable job by
subdividing space and directionality recursively using interval
arithmetic until you reach an adequate approximation.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
