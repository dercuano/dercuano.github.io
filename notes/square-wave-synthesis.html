(2 minutes)</div><p>An integral of a square wave is a spline approximation of a sine wave.
The third integral is a cubic-spline approximation, which has very low
harmonic distortion.  The amplitude of the approximated sine wave is
the amplitude of the square wave scaled by the Nth power of the
period; for a third-order spline, it’s scaled by the cube of the
period.</p>
<p>This is interesting because the discrete analog of integral, running
sum, is linear, time-invariant, and very cheap indeed to compute (one
accumulator and one addition per sample), and sine waves are useful
primitives for composing many signals.</p>
<p>In the case of audio synthesis, in particular, I’m thinking you can
take some square waves (or envelope-shaped square waves), add them
together, and take their running sum a few times, to get a mix of
sinusoidal signals.</p>
<p>To be concrete, suppose you’re synthesizing 16ksps audio, and you want
to be able to cover the audible range down to 20Hz and up to the
Nyquist frequency at 8kHz.  A 20Hz square wave has a period of
16000/40 = 400 samples on both the top and bottom; this results in
amplifying the original square wave by about 400³ for a third-order
spline, or 64 million.  (This is not quite correct because of
discretization; the actual number is 10.6 to 10.7 million.)  This
means you need 32-bit integer math for your accumulators (and for the
amplitudes of your higher frequencies), but that 32-bit math gives you
a dynamic range at 20Hz of 10dB log₁₀((2³¹/10.6M)²) = 46dB, which is
quite respectable.</p>
<p>At higher frequencies, you have correspondingly more dynamic range; at
Nyquist, you have 31 bits of dynamic range, since the square wave <em>is</em>
the sine wave, or 187 dB.</p>
<p>So you have square waves, which are more or less cheap to compute (at
least as long as you’re far from Nyquist and can therefore disregard
jitter), and which you sum; and then you integrate them (three times)
to get a sum of (cubic) spline approximations of sine waves.  You have
to scale the amplitudes of the square waves as mentioned above,
proportional to the Nth power of the frequency.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
