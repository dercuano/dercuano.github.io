(1 minute)</div><p>In additional to the usual countercurrent configuration for minimal
heat loss and the cocurrent configuration occasionally used, a
recuperator-type heat exchanger may be arranged in a cross-current
configuration for process intensification, where you have alternating
layers of pipes in the X and Y directions.  (A rete mirabile is a much
better way to do high-density heat exchange, but that is a different
topic.)</p>
<p>This cross-current configuration is optimal, however, for a different
purpose: rapid zone melting.  Although I suspect that the speed of
zone melting is limited by crystal growth speeds, maybe you can still
do it faster by doing it in thin pipes (made of a material that
doesn’t dissolve significantly in the material you’re trying to
purify, of course).  You can run hot coolant through only one or two
cross-current pipes above and below the layer of the material being
purified to melt it in a narrow region, while perhaps simultaneously
running cool coolant through other adjacent pipes to intensify the
temperature gradient.</p>
<p>By switching between pipes, it should be possible to rapidly move the
molten zone along the material being purified.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/materials.html">Materials</a> (112 notes)
