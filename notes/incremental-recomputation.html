(12 minutes)</div><p>Let’s solve cache invalidation, legendarily one of the two hardest
problems in computer science.</p>
<p>Why is it hard?  We can construct a hard example in three lines of code.</p>
<p>Suppose we construct a unidirectional data flow graph as follows:</p>
<pre><code>x, y, z = Input(value=3), Input(value=4), Input(value=2)
p = Max(x, y)
for i in range(10000): p = Max(p, Subtract(p, z))
</code></pre>
<p>This constructs a directed acyclic graph of dataflow with 20004 nodes:
three Input nodes, 10001 Max nodes, and 10000 Subtract nodes.  If we
increase y’s value to 5, this changes the value of all of the Max
nodes to 5 and all of the Subtract nodes to 3.  By contrast, if we
increase or decrease the value of x by 1, no other nodes have new
values.  How can we implement this efficiently?</p>
<p>There are a variety of different strategies you can use to evaluate
such a dataflow graph, but most of them have serious pitfalls which
can be demonstrated on the above graph.</p>
<p>To keep the scope of this note manageable, I’m only writing about
algorithms for <em>static</em> dataflow graphs here, where the topology of
the computation is independent of the data that flows through it, like
an electronic circuit.  To some extent, you can force conditionals
into a static dataflow framework as conditional or multiplexing nodes,
and iteration as array-valued values (as in TensorFlow), so this is
somewhat less restrictive than it sounds.</p>
<h2>Pure immediate mode</h2>
<p>The simplest strategy is to calculate values on demand.  To be
concrete, you might have an <code>eval</code> method of no arguments which
invokes the <code>eval</code> methods of the node’s inputs:</p>
<pre><code>def eval(self):  # for Max nodes
    return max(self.input1.eval(), self.input2.eval())
</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty much the approach I use in Pytebeat, for example, with
values being arrays of 1024 numbers.  On some dataflow graphs, this
works fine, but on this one, it requires 4 + 2¹⁰⁰⁰¹ calls to <code>eval</code>,
which on my laptop would take about 10²⁹⁹⁵ years, at which point all
the stars will have gone out and essentially all matter will be either
iron or leptons, depending on whether protons are stable; this is not
a practical way to evaluate this dataflow graph.  The issue is that
nodes whose output is used more than once will be evaluated more than
once, which is exponential-time in such pathological cases.</p>
<p>(In Python it actually fails sooner than that by default because the
default stack limit is not high enough.)</p>
<h2>Topologically-sorted immediate mode</h2>
<p>You can calculate values on demand in guaranteed linear time, though.
You begin by doing a topological sort of the nodes to construct a
sequence such that each node comes before the nodes that use its
value; then you can simply iterate over the sequence, storing the
output of each node in an array or something.</p>
<p>This allows you to do the calculation several times for different
input values without repeating the topological sort.  In effect, you
have compiled the dataflow graph into a branchless virtual machine
program with a certain flavor of common subexpression elimination.</p>
<p>But, if you think about the standard topological sort algorithm, you
will see that you could also do the equivalent of interpretation — you
can evaluate the value for each node as you generate the
topologically-sorted sequence.</p>
<p>(As it happens, in the example code, the nodes are necessarily created
in a topologically-sorted sequence, because each node is constructed
with its inputs as parameters.  So in this case you can simply define
<code>Max, Subtract, Input = max, operator.sub, lambda value: value</code> and
never construct the graph in memory at all.)</p>
<p>Either way, this approach only touches each node once; on this graph
it takes perhaps 100000 function calls, or about a millisecond for
this graph, if you do it in Python with an existing in-memory graph.</p>
<p>This doesn’t sound so bad, and in the case where you are evaluating
some dataflow graph on all new inputs you've never seen before it's
absolutely optimal and everything else we'll discuss in this note is
slower, but in the case where you just changed x by 1, it takes 100000
function calls to tell you that nothing else has changed as a result.
That’s about three to five orders of magnitude slower than would seem
reasonable.  So let’s look at incremental approaches to dataflow
evaluation.</p>
<h2>Invalidation propagation</h2>
<p>I wrote about how you could treat the topologically-sorted sequence of
operations as a sort of program.  But this suggests that you could
backtrack in it: if you have 50 operations, and input A isn’t used
before the 25th operation, the first 25 are guaranteed not to change
their value just because input A changed.  So you could just start the
execution from operation 25, using the previously calculated values
for operations 0–24, and then you don’t have to do a bunch of
redundant recalculation of values that are guaranteed not to have
changed.</p>
<p>But this actually works a lot better with the “intepretive”
topological sort, because it doesn’t have to arbitrarily pick an
ordering among nodes that have no actual data dependencies, so it can
evaluate only nodes that changed data feeds into.</p>
<p>The way this looks is that changing an input works in two steps:
first, you “retract” the current value, causing all the nodes that
depend on it to also retract their current values; then, you assert a
new value, causing all the nodes that depend on it to be recomputed.
If a node gets an input asserted while some other input whose value it
needs is still retracted, its output remains retracted.  Only once all
the required inputs are asserted can it assert a value.</p>
<p>In many cases, you can improve performance by retracting several
things at once and then asserting their new values, instead of
changing their values one at a time.</p>
<p>This approach is pretty broadly applicable, but it doesn’t help for
our example graph; when we retract x=3, the invalidation propagates
through 20002 nodes, and then when we assert x=2, the same value
propagates through those same nodes again.  It takes about twice as
long as just calculating all the values from scratch without trying to
be incremental.</p>
<h2>Pull-based invalidation, or laziness</h2>
<p>As I’ve described it above, invalidation propagation is eager — when
you initially assert values for x and y, that pushes the Max node to
compute their max, which then pushes the first Subtract node to
compute a zero, which then pushes another Max node to compute a value,
and so on.  Computation is initiated by inputs and results in outputs.</p>
<p>It may happen that the end result of all this computation is, for
example, to display a number on the screen, which can only happen at
most about 60 times a second, depending on your hardware.  But suppose
you are changing x or y much more often than this — most of the values
computed will never be used.</p>
<p>Now, if the value computed has to be available on a tight deadline,
you need some kind of eager computation to store it ahead of time
instead of computing it on demand.  But what if it’s okay to compute
it on demand?</p>
<p>In that case, you can have nodes assert their outputs only upon
request.  In the case of our example graph, first you construct the
graph, but don’t calculate values for any of the nodes except x and y.
Then, you request the output from the final p node.  Since its inputs
are retracted, it requests them to compute; whichever input tries to
compute first finds that its inputs are also retracted, so it asks one
of them to compute; and so on, until we are requesting the output of
Max(x, y).  Its inputs are asserted, so it computes its result (4) and
asserts it; this allows a Subtract node to compute its result (2) and
assert it; and so on.</p>
<p>This is roughly two thirds as efficient as the push-based approach in
this case, and when we retract x later, it does the same invalidation
propagation.  The difference is that, when we assert x again, no
further computation happens — nothing is currently requesting x’s
value.  We can change x or y many times in between screen frames,
cheaply.</p>
<p>However, it still has to recompute all 20002 computational nodes in
order to discover that changing x doesn't change the final output
value.</p>
<h2>Change propagation</h2>
<p>What if we don’t have a separate retraction step, but just assert the
new value of x?  This helps a lot in this case — the Max node that
depends on x can detect that its output values remains 4, so it
doesn’t need to propagate any change.</p>
<p>But what happens when we change y?  If we change y to 8, the Max node
updates to 8.  This value needs to be sent to the next Max node and
the Subtract node.  Suppose we pick the Subtract node.  Now its value
(y-z) is 6, so it updates its value to 6.  This gets pushed to the
next Max node, which is now comparing 6 to 5, and so it asserts 6 on
its output, pushing to two nodes.  Later on, when the new value from
the previous Max node reaches it, it must recompute a second time.
This kind of thing can result in an exponential number of
recomputations, just as with pure immediate mode.</p>
<p>XXX hmm, maybe I need a better example to show the potential exponential behavior, because it peters out here</p>
<p>XXX does breadth-first propagation solve the exponential-time problem?</p>
<p>There’s another problem, though, besides efficiency: “glitches” or
“timing hazards”.  That second Max node’s output was 4 at the
beginning and 8 at the end.  But for a moment in the middle, after its
first recomputation but before its second one, its output was 6.  6
was never a correct value for max(max(x, y), max(x, y) - z)!  If that
value change results in your software system taking some action, you
could be in trouble.</p>
<p>This happens at a very concrete level in digital logic circuits, in
which "glitch" is a technical term for this kind of transient wrong
answer.  There, the standard solution is a clock whose edges trigger
flip-flops.</p>
<h2>Memoization</h2>
<p>As an alternative to storing the current value of each node, we could instead
store some set of previously computed values, according to the inputs that
affect them.  In the most direct form, of course, applied to a single node,
this doesn't help much — computing the max of 3 and 4 is faster than looking up
(3, 4) in a cache to return 4.  But we could imagine, for example, memoizing a
larger chunk of the graph.</p>
<p>The potential benefit of memoization, as opposed to the strategies described
above, is that if part of the graph returns to a previous state, the result of
that previous state can be retrieved from the cache — it isn't just a matter of
"state unchanged" or "state changed".</p>
<h2>Chunking</h2>
<p>In fact, chunking the graph into smaller subgraphs — giant nodes that perhaps produce multiple values — is an approach that can be applied to all of the previous </p>
