(3 minutes)</div><p>There’s this thing called “immediate-mode GUIs” floating around which
is kind of related to immediate- versus retained-mode drawing systems.
But it’s not really.  In an immediate-mode GUI, you supply the library
with a function which draws your UI, and it invokes it when necessary,
influencing its execution as needed.</p>
<p>A real drawing equivalent of immediate-mode GUIs might be how you
would draw if you only had a single scan line of framebuffer.  You
could have a function that represented the image you wanted to draw,
invoked with a drawing context object of type <code>dctx</code>, once every scan
line:</p>
<pre><code>void draw_stuff(dctx *c)
{
    draw_rect(c, 10, 10, 100, 100, DC_GREY);
    draw_circle(c, 10, 10, 100, 100, DC_BLACK);
    int baseline = 55;
    if (bbox(c, baseline - font_height, 0, baseline, 100)) {
        char *s = "Welcome";
        int text_width = text_escapement(s);  // for centering
        show_text(c, 55 - text_width/2, baseline, s, DC_RED, DC_BLACK);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is almost entirely abstract over the question of
whether you’re drawing a scanline at a time or what.</p>
<p>The <code>bbox</code> function determines whether or not part of the
currently-being-drawn area impinges on that bounding box.  If not, the
user-provided function above skips the potentially expensive
calculations within.  This is the same approach IMGUI libraries use to
handle buttons being clicked, menus being open, and so on.</p>
<p>Serious IMGUI libraries do stuff to help you divide your GUI-drawing
function into separately memoized parts, but I’m not going to touch on
that here.  Instead I’m going to focus on the idea of using this to
make it usable to draw graphics scanline by scanline.</p>
<p>Let’s consider what <code>show_text</code> has to do.  It’s being invoked with a
<code>dctx</code>, a start point, some text, a foreground, and a background:</p>
<pre><code>// in the dctx library:
void show_text(dctx *c, int x, int y, char *s, color fg, color bg)
{
    &lt;&lt;show_text implementation&gt;&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s suppose for the moment that we only have one font, and it’s a
proportional bitmap font; and that this function in particular only
has to draw a single line.</p>
<p>First, we ought to check to see if our bounding-box is being drawn,
which means we have to compute it.</p>
<pre><code>// in show_text implementation:
int width = text_escapement(s), max_x = x + width, min_y = y - font_height;
if (!bbox(c, x, min_y, max_x, y)) return;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, though, we need to copy the appropriate chunks of pixels into the
scan line, in the appropriate color.  This part inevitably depends on
the fact that we’re drawing a single scanline, rather than half a
scanline or four scanlines.</p>
<pre><code>int font_line = c-&gt;y - min_y;
char k;
for (char *p = s; (k = *p) != '\0'; p++) {
    short pixels = get_font_pixel_slice(k, font_line);
    char width = get_font_pixel_width(k);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; width; i++) {
        c-&gt;buf[x] = pixels &amp; 1 ? fg : bg;
        x++;
        pixels &gt;&gt;= 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that’s it, aside from some relatively mundane details about
<code>get_font_pixel_width</code> and <code>get_font_pixel_slice</code>.  That gives you the
software equivalent of an old-style character generator, permitting
color framebufferless rendering at arbitrary pixel offsets.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
