(21 minutes)</div><p>As explained in <a href="../notes/electric-hammer.html">Electric hammer</a> and <a href="../notes/hammering-toolhead.html">Hammering toolhead</a>,
a hammer is a simple machine, although Archimedes and Galileo were
unaware of this because they lacked the modern concept of kinetic
energy; its mechanical advantage is limited only by the fact that its
impact is not instantaneous.</p>
<p>It turns out that it is possible to substantially improve this
mechanical advantage.</p>
<h2>Basic hammering physics</h2>
<p>As impact time approaches zero, the force and pressure of the impact
approach infinity.  Moreover, even during the impact, the deceleration
of the hammer varies; as the deceleration approaches infinity, so does
the force and pressure.</p>
<p>Thus you can beat an ice cube with a massive broomstick without
damaging it, but a light whack with the bowl of a metal spoon can
shatter it; and the tempered glass of a car window can withstand a
baseball bat impact, but not a crackhead throwing a piece of
sintered-aluminum-oxide spark plug at it.</p>
<p>Once the impact begins, the resulting deceleration does not affect the
entire hammer at once, nor does the force affect the entire workpiece
at once; instead, they travel through these bodies as sound waves.
These waves reflect from other surfaces of the bodies in the same way
that electrical waves reflect from the ends of transmission lines or
sound waves reflect from the open ends of pipes, and may be focused or
scattered in different parts of the solids.  As a rule of thumb, the
transmission line or hammer behaves like a rigid object or
lumped-element node only over timescales about ten times the
round-trip time of waves through it.</p>
<p>These sound waves are somewhat more complex than everyday sound waves.
First, they involve both shear waves and compression waves, which
travel at different speeds, each of which can produce the other under
some circumstances.  Second, their magnitude is often large enough to
cause the usual linear approximations to break down; in particular, if
there is a region within which the material stiffens with increased
deformation, this can cause higher-amplitude waves to travel faster
than, and overtake, lower-amplitude waves, and this can result in the
propagation of self-sustaining discontinuous wavefronts through the
material — in sound waves in air we call this a “shock wave” or a
“detonation”, and a similar phenomenon in water channels is a “flash
flood” or, on the beach, a “breaker”.  Except when playing a
percussion instrument, normally the point of using a hammer is to
provoke some kind of nonlinear response from the thing you are
hammering on, such as breaking or deforming plastically, so these
phenomena are actually quite common in hammering.</p>
<p>Additionally, unless the impact is deep inside a hole in the
workpiece, surface acoustic waves represent additional modes of
vibration that may or may not carry significant energy dissipation.</p>
<h2>Paddles</h2>
<p>One obvious approach to shortening the impact time and thus increasing
the force is to shorten the distance from the impact side of the
hammer head to the back side, shortening the timescale over which it
behaves like a rigid object.  Taken to the logical extreme, this
suggests using a hammer that is just a thin, flat sheet of material,
which is brought into contact with the workpiece at the same time over
its whole surface.</p>
<p>One use of this approach is the “slapper foil” detonator, which does
in fact work, but other examples include flat paddles, slappers, or
leather spanking straps used to punish children or excite masochists.
These enable the development of sufficiently high impact forces to
cause localized tissue damage despite low energies (typically on the
order of a joule) distributed over large areas (typically on the order
of 100 J/m<sup>2</sup>).  Even more prosaically, the same strategy is
used for open-hand slapping, which the humans commonly use as a form
of symbolic aggression to induce pain without any danger of more
serious damage; and it is a factor in the effectiveness of spoon
shattering of ice as well.</p>
<p>One difficulty of slapping things with paddles is that, in air, the
large surface area of the paddle tends to accumulate an area of
high-pressure air in front of it, soaking up most of the input energy.
This can be desirable if the objective is merely to make a loud noise,
but if maximal impact force is the objective, it is a drawback.
Strategies to reduce this problem include putting air holes in the
paddle, dividing the paddle into many strands (a “flogger”), or using
a whip rather than a paddle.</p>
<h2>Workpiece waveform propagation</h2>
<p>During the impact, wavefronts of deformation are traveling through the
workpiece as well as the hammer, and if the materials have reasonably
similar acoustic impedances, they can even pass back and forth across
the hammer-workpiece interface rather than being entirely reflected.
Their particular behavior in the workpiece material depends on the
properties of that material; for example, when a human is being
slapped, I think much of the slap energy is dissipated by viscous and
plastic behavior in the immediate neighborhood of the impact, so there
is no tissue damage even millimeters away, while when using a bent
wire to tap glass that has been scored on the other side, the stresses
induced by the propagating wave are high enough to provoke the
formation of a crack from the score.</p>
<p>(I don’t really know if that’s the reason slapping humans causes no
damage except at submillimeter distances from the impact.  Possibly
dispersion also plays a role.)</p>
<h2>Sensitivity to impact conditions</h2>
<p>The direction in which each wavefront travels through the workpiece
depends on the speed of each sound in the workpiece material and on
the relative phase of the impact at each part of the workpiece
surface; since the speeds of sound in solids are typically around
1km/s and the speeds of movement of hammers are typically around 1m/s,
even fairly small rotations between mated hammer and workpiece
surfaces can result in fairly large differences in propagation
directions.  Consider a flat hammer face that is 10mm across striking
a flat workpiece at 1 m/s with a compression-wave speed of sound of
1km/s with one milliradian of deviation from parallelism.  So, when
one side of the hammer face strikes, the other is still 10 microns
away from striking; the contact area spreads across the hammer face
gradually, as the hammer and workpiece deform, until reaching the
opposite edge of the face 10 microseconds later.  In those 10
microseconds, the waves from the initial impact have propagated 10 mm
into the material, resulting in a planar wavefront propagating at a
60-degree angle from the surface normal, rather than in a nearly
normal direction, as you might expect.  The shear (or transverse or S)
waves will propagate in a more nearly normal direction, since they
propagate typically about 40% slower.</p>
<p>Since the “propagation time” of the contact area across the material
is on the order of the speed of sound in either material, we should
not expect the initial impact to alter the conditions much for later
parts of the impact.</p>
<h2>Shaped hammers</h2>
<p>By shaping the hammer face to time different parts of the impact
relative to one another, we can change the propagation characteristics
of the wave in the material.  For example, a convex hammer face, like
the bowl of a spoon, or the traditional spherical blacksmithing
hammers of Dablo, Burkina Faso, shown in Christopher Roy’s documentary
“From Iron Ore to Iron Hoe”, will tend to produce a spherical wave
that propagates outwards in all directions in the workpiece from a
common center, and inwards toward a focus inside the hammer, like the
convergent ultrasound waves used in sonoluminescence.  A concave
hammer face will tend to produce a convergent wave <em>within the
workpiece</em>, but as noted above, small misalignments in the hammer
angle will produce large deviations in the direction in which the wave
propagates.</p>
<p>You might think that a potentially more predictable way to focus waves
within the workpiece might be to shape the workpiece surface to be
concave instead, but that just makes matters worse; the same small
angles of hammer misalignments will still produce the same large
angles of deviation, and additionally now lateral translation of the
hammer blow by similar amounts will also produce those same deviation
angles.</p>
<h3>Outriggers</h3>
<p>A better approach is to use three or more small “outriggers” sticking
out of the sides of the hammer face to rotate it into submicron
alignment with the workpiece surface by elastically deforming over
hundreds of microseconds before the main impact.  This approach can
also compensate for some degree of imperfection in the workpiece
surface itself, but not for micron-scale concavity or convexity over
the impact area.</p>
<h3>Phased arrays</h3>
<p>Given a precise depth map of the workpiece surface, you could use a
phased array of hammers in, for example, a hexagonal grid, each
launched toward the surface to arrive at a time scheduled with
submicrosecond jitter; this should enable the formation of a precisely
customized wavefront within the workpiece material.</p>
<p>I had thought that perhaps you could use independent outriggers on a
swarm of independent hammers (perhaps swung together using some kind
of compliant coupling) to do this depth-mapping and timing
mechanically rather than in software; the idea was that the outriggers
would come into contact with the surface first, with the
microsecond-scale jitter imposed by micron-scale surface roughness and
milliradian-scale alignment imprecision, and would act to retard the
subhammers that would otherwise make contact first and/or advance the
subhammers that would otherwise make contact late, all by a few
microseconds.  But I don’t see how to make that work mechanically.</p>
<h3>Focusing hammers</h3>
<p>Given a known hammer geometry, it should be possible to arrange for
focusing of deformation waves at or near the hammer surface as well.
For example, a convex hammer surface can produce an expanding
spherical pressure wave inside the hammer upon the initial impact,
with minimal dependence on the precise angle and position of the
impact; if the back surface of the hammer is an ellipsoid with one
focus at the virtual source of this wave, it can then reflect this
spherical wave into a convergent spherical wave focused on a
particular point or points.  (See <a href="../notes/caustics.html">Caustics</a> for notes on
designing light-reflective surfaces to form chosen focused patterns of
intense light; this approach is also applicable to these sound waves.)
The material at or near this focus point will experience stresses
enormously greater than the stresses it would normally experience from
an ordinary hammer blow, perhaps by two orders of magnitude or more.
This point can be chosen to be within the hammer, at the interface
with the workpiece, and probably most usefully, some distance inside
the workpiece, thus limiting the damage to the hammer.</p>
<p>To be concrete, suppose we are using a steel hammer with a Young’s
modulus of 200 GPa (which <a href="../notes/plastic-cutters.html">Plastic cutters</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A36_steel">Wikipedia</a>
claim is typical of steels), weighing 1 kg, swung at 10 m/s, striking
a flat piece of steel, and the hammer’s circular striking surface is
shaped to be precisely 20 microns higher in the center than at its
edges, which are 40 mm apart.  (At 7.9 g/cc, the hammer head then must
average 101 mm long to weigh 10 kg.)  If the hammer strikes straight
on, the center of its face will strike 2 microseconds earlier than its
edges do.  Supposing the speed of sound in steel is 6 km/s, that means
the center of the wave will have a phase advance of 2 microseconds and
12 mm relative to the edges.  The 12 mm of steel compressed by 20
microns amounts to 1.7 millistrains and thus is under some 300 MPa of
pressure.  (XXX this is wrong but I don’t know how to correct it yet;
see below.)</p>
<p>A naive, untutored hammer of these dimensions used in this way will
convert its 50 J of kinetic energy in a relatively straightforward
fashion into 50 J of elastic deformation, with the pressure wave and
other waves bouncing back and forth through the hammer and workpiece,
augmenting the pressure by some 300 MPa on each bounce, over a
timescale of a millisecond or two, during which time the hammer has
come to a stop and begun to rebound violently — an average
deceleration of about 5 km/s/s with a peak of about 10 km/s/s,
producing about 10 kN of peak force.  However, this only amounts to
about 8 MPa of pressure, so clearly I have miscalculated in a very
significant way above; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A36_steel">ASTM A36 steel</a> actually has a yield stress
of only 250 MPa, so 8 MPa is a lot more plausible than 250 MPa.</p>
<p>(This 10 kN amounts to a mechanical advantage of about 1000, depending
on how much space you have to swing the hammer in: a constant 10 N
accelerates the 1 kg hammer up to 10 m/s in one second, requiring 5
meters of swing.)</p>
<p>Suppose our super-hammer, with its ellipsoidal back face, can focus
the initial impact wave to two orders of magnitude higher strains
within the workpiece, or some 800 MPa.  This is enough to provoke cold
steel into plasticity, which will prevent the 800 MPa figure from
actually being reached.  A significant fraction of the impact energy
will then be converted into heat within about a gram of steel inside
the workpiece, heating it by some tens of degrees.</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>If it is possible to provoke fracture in the workpiece by this
approach, which should be easily feasible for brittle materials, the
available concentration factors should increase dramatically: the
bubble of vacuum thus formed inside the workpiece would experience
very large forces and temperatures as its walls crashed together on
the following oscillation, again similar to sonoluminescence or to the
collapse of the void when a stone falls into water or fluidized sand.</p>
<p>A particularly interesting situation is when the focus is at or near
the opposite face of a flat workpiece, because it seems plausible that
this mechanism could be used to pit it, eject material from it,
heat-treat it, or cold-weld it to something else.  This is a
particularly appealing prospect for heat-treating inaccessible places
like the interior surfaces of structural tubing after welding,
although it might turn out to be impractical to achieve high enough
concentration factors in ductile metals to reach the necessary
temperatures.</p>
<h3>Hammer materials</h3>
<p>Better hammer materials might include things like copper and tungsten,
with their lower speeds of sound, or even some kind of lead-filled
steel foam.  Graded-acoustic-impedance metamaterials should make it
possible to reflectionlessly couple sonic energy into the workpiece
even from a hammer (or other transducer) with a quite different
acoustic impedance.</p>
<h2>Multilayer slappers</h2>
<p>Above I mentioned that one use of paddles is for exciting masochists.
A device popular in this connection is a thing known as a “slapper”: a
double-layered paddle similar to the slapstick used in vaudeville or
by Arlecchino.  Shortly after the initial impact, the second layer of
the paddle slaps into the first, producing an additional painful
impact (as well as a much louder noise).</p>
<p>A potential advantage of this construction is that energy is not lost
during the hammer swing to the air resistance of the second layer; the
air between the layers moves along with the hammer, so it only absorbs
any energy during the impact, when it is compressed between the layers
to some degree, which is what gives the slapstick its loud slap.</p>
<p>This could be extended to many layers, but without further
elaboration, the layers will produce many separate impacts as they
pile up on a pile on the workpiece, starting with the ones closest to
the workpiece.  This may be useful for producing some sort of
vibration or recorded-sound reproduction, but by itself it will not
produce any kind of unusual impact; dead-blow hammers filled with shot
already do something similar.</p>
<p>What is needed for giant pressure is for the layers to collide very
nearly simultaneously, but in the <em>reverse</em> order, starting with the
layers furthest from the workpiece, with the compression wave
propagating through each layer just in time for the layer to hit the
next layer.  For 1-mm-thick layers of steel, the ideal timing should
be about 170 ns apart; with 100 such layers the overall sequence would
total about 17 microseconds.</p>
<p>However, even if the impacts are simultaneous, this would only broaden
the peak of the shock wave traveling through the stack of layers by
those 17 microseconds, which is already about a factor of 50 to 100
better than a standard hammer, exceeding the physical limits of steel,
though perhaps not those of some technical ceramics.</p>
<p>A variety of well-known pantograph-like linkages could be pressed into
service for getting the stack of layers to uniformly expand and
contract; moreover, they could be activated by the contact of
“outriggers” with the workpiece surface, thus completing the stackup
as the frontmost layer slams into the surface.  The difficulty will be
to get them to perform with enough precision to significantly exceed
the impact force of an ordinary hammer.</p>
<p>By slightly thinning the sheets in their centers, the impact shock
wave can be produced as a convergent spherical shock wave, focused as
before on a chosen position within the workpiece.  In this case,
however, the precision of the hammer’s positioning and angle are no
longer so important, because the focusing of the shock wave does not
depend on them, but only on the relative positioning of the layers in
the stackup.</p>
<p>How much would you need to thin them?  With the 40-mm-diameter,
101-mm-long geometry suggested above, and 6 km/s propagation velocity,
the rearmost sheet would need a phase advance of about 2 mm and thus
333 ns at its outermost edge, if the focus is near the front of the
hammer.  If a 10 m/s impact velocity were split up evenly among 100
inter-sheet gaps, it would strike the sheet in front of it with a
relative velocity of 0.1 m/s, so we’re talking about etching it 33
nanometers deep in the middle to get a 330-ns phase difference.  Other
sheets would be etched progressively deeper, but we’re still talking
about a very difficult level of precision to reach any meaningful kind
of focus.</p>
<p>By perforating the sheets it should be possible to provide
low-resistance air paths from the center of the stack to outside of
it, thus reducing the loss of potential impact energy to air
compression.  Simple aligned round perforations would provide
lengthwise channels, but elongated and partly-aligned perforations
could provide diagonal and radial air channels, which would be shorter
and thus lower-resistance for many hammer geometries.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
