<p>So one of the reasons I’m excited about automated fabrication
(e.g. Fab@Home, tabletop CNC mills, RepRap, inkjet-printing of
circuits, fused deposition modeling) is that I expect it will make it
possible to build computers from raw materials with minimal capital.
It will be some time before those computers are as cheap or as fast as
mass-produced microcontrollers, so they will start out as curiosities.
But how far away is the prospect of automatically building a working
computer from raw materials with minimal capital?  I think it’s
already possible.</p>
<p>This post considers three kinds of mechanical computers: one using
Merkle’s <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/mechano.html" title="Two Types of Mechanical Reversible Logic, by Ralph Merkle">buckling logic</a>, one using mechanical
height fields, and one using pulling of threads.</p>
<p>Organic semiconductors, nonlinear acoustic devices, fluidic logic, or
something more exotic, might turn out to be the form that computers
made by 3-D printers eventually take; but I’m pretty sure Merkle’s
approach is workable.  So I’m going to consider that first. And I want
to describe some ideas of my own.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t know shit about mechanical engineering.  If any
actual mechanical engineer is annoyed at my ignorant speculations when
they read this, I’d be delighted to hear about all the things I’m
getting wrong.</p>
<h2>How many logic gates? Around 64000.</h2>
<p>There have been a number of capable small CPUs over the years that
contain on the order of 4000-8000 transistors, including the 6502 used
in the Apple ][, the NES, and the Atari 2600 (4000 transistors, 8-bit
ALU), Chuck Moore’s MuP21 (6000 transistors, 21-bit ALU, including
video coprocessor), Voyager 2’s RCA 1802 (5000 transistors), CP/M
machines’ 8085 (6500 transistors) (the 8080 was smaller but needed
more support circuitry), the Apollo Guidance Computer (4100 3-input
RTL NOR gates, which I think is about 8200 transistors) and so on.
The IBM 1401 was supposedly more complex:
<a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL64-i.html">http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL64-i.html</a> says a minimal 1401
system had 6213 diodes and 4315 transistors.  It ran at 86 957 Hz.
(How big was the PDP-7 Unics was written on?)</p>
<p>To run an interpreted programming language, you probably need at least
32000 bits of memory, and twice that is better.</p>
<p>So 64000 “logic elements”, each of which can be either a bit of memory
or a gate, should more than suffice.  64000 is the cube of 40, so a
40x40x40 cube of logic elements would be sufficient if you didn’t need
any space for signal routing.  In two-dimensional chips, I’ve heard
it’s typical to spend 90% of the area on routing; things are much
closer together in three dimensions (64000 elements is about 250×250
in 2D, so that far-apart things in a device of that size need more
than six times as much wire to connect them), so 10x routing overhead
is quite a pessimistic assumption for 3-D; but if we accept it, then
we need an 86×86×86 cube.</p>
<p>It might be possible to reduce this substantially if the memory is
some kind of bulk medium instead of one or more parts per
bit. Historically-used bulk media have included mercury acoustic delay
lines; magnetostrictive torsion acoustic delay lines in wire; magnetic
films on tapes, drums, and discs; impressions in the surface of
thixotropic substances such as wax or wet clay; ink or pencil lead on
papyrus or paper; knots tied in khipu cords; and electric charges on
the surface of cathode-ray tubes.</p>
<h2>How many voxels per logic gate? Around 1200 for Merkle gates.</h2>
<p>How big does each element need to be?  Presumably if we’re fabricating
it with the CandyFab 2000, it needs to be pretty gigantic.  (Sugar
wouldn’t bend enough, but maybe you could make it out of polyethylene
pellets with the CandyFab.)  But if you are depositing tiny beads of
molten ABS plastic with 2-mil precision, you could make it a lot
smaller. You could probably get a working Merkle buckling-spring cell
in something like 16x6x12 voxels:</p>

<p>If that were really the size you needed, at 2 mils per voxel, it would
be 32 × 12 × 24 mils, or about 0.8 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.6 mm, which
altogether adds up to just over an eighth of a cubic millimeter ---
0.52 mm cubed.</p>
<p>You could probably do something a lot more ingenious and get an order
of magnitude or two improvement.</p>
<p>Which means that the total 86×86×86 cube, 6 billion voxels, would be
45 mm on a side, if you have a 3-D printer that can construct a
complex object with arbitrary 2-mil voxels.</p>
<p>One big advantage of the Merkle-gate design is that it doesn’t require
any contact between separate elements, sliding or otherwise, so
surface finish may be less crucial than for some other kinds of
machines.</p>
<h2>Height-field computing: mechanical LUTs to reduce the number of elements</h2>
<p>The elements in modern FPGAs (“field-programmable <em>gate</em> arrays”)
mostly consist of lookup tables (“LUTs”) rather than actual gates in
the array.  The idea is that basically you use your N bits of input to
index into a little EEPROM and get a bit of output, which allows you
to emulate any possible combinational circuit, and then you have
“routing resources” — basically crossbar multiplexers — to connect
those outputs to the inputs of other cells.</p>
<p>For automated fabrication to help much with building mechanical
computers, compared to just carving them out of wood or steel or
whatever with non-automated machine tools, it’s going to have to
reduce the number of separate pieces that you have to assemble
manually when you’re done. Some kinds of 3-D printing can print
already-assembled parts that mesh together nicely and aren’t stuck
together; others can’t. Those that can’t will probably require manual
assembly for a while yet. (Although, hey, pick-and-place machines
could be used for that, right?)</p>
<h3>Height fields as a mechanical realization of LUTs</h3>
<p>LUTs have a fairly straightforward low-parts-count mechanical
realization.  If you have a needle-like probe positioned over a solid
height field, then when you lower the probe onto the height field, the
height at which it stops will be an arbitrary function of its X and Y
coordinates: the height of the surface at that point.  This “lowering”
step is similar to the step of squeezing the gate of a
Merkle buckling-spring gate,
or pushing a Drexlerian rod-logic rod
to see where it stops.</p>
<p>If you encoded one bit in X and one bit in Y, you can get an arbitrary
two-input boolean function in Z; but Z’s range isn’t limited to
booleans.  Likewise, you could encode multiple bits in each of X and
Y; you’re limited largely by the aspect ratio of holes you can carve
into your height field. In fact, to compensate for minor errors in X
and Y, there should be at least a dimple in the surface at the desired
position.</p>
<p>But if you carry this out just like that, you may end up with tall,
thin towers on your height field, which will be prone to bending or
breaking. Instead, you could just drill a matrix of holes of different
depths. How small could you make these holes?</p>
<p>Jewelers’ twist drill bits, which cut cylindrical holes, normally come
in sizes 1 through 80 in the US.  According to Wikipedia, size 80 is
0.343 mm in diameter, or 0.0135", about a 74th of an inch.  So you
could probably drill a 32x32 matrix of these holes into a one-inch
block of, say, aluminum, brass, or soapstone.  Then you’d only need
the positioning of the probe to be accurate to within about 0.007" to
make sure that it went into a hole; if your machine drilling the
depths, like certain inexpensive home knockoff CNC drill presses, were
only accurate to 0.002", you could use a 3× mechanical advantage
between the probe and whatever input it was driving so that you would
need a 1" x 1" x 0.5" cube of metal for this 32x32 array of holes.</p>
<p>(It’s probably best to translate the block itself in at least one of
the three dimensions, rather than translating the probe in all three,
in order to diminish the accumulated positional error.)</p>
<p>I’m not sure how many drill bits this procedure would use up, and how
much it would cost.  <a href="http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/the-real-cost-of-runout" title="The Real Cost of Runout">“The Real Cost of Runout”</a> talks
about reducing the cost of drilling 3mm-diameter holes from 80 cents
to 27 cents per hole by reducing runout on the drill press, or from 23
cents to 10 cents per hole when using high-speed steel instead of
tungsten carbide — and these numbers are just for the cost of the
drill bits!  But 1024 holes at 10 cents per hole is still US$102.40.
I hope smaller holes cost less?</p>
<p>Smaller drills exist; <a href="http://www.ukam.com/diamond_core_drills.html">http://www.ukam.com/diamond_core_drills.html</a>
says they have diamond drills “from .001" to 48" (.0254mm to 1219mm)
diameter.”  Being able to drill holes of .001" diameter would mean
being able to drill a 32×32 array of holes in 0.064" × 0.064".  On
<a href="http://www.ukam.com/micro_core_drills.htm">http://www.ukam.com/micro_core_drills.htm</a> they actually only list
drills down to 0.006", which they recommend using at 150 000 RPM, feed
rate 0.010" per minute.</p>
<p>In some ways, this kind of drilling operation is less demanding than ordinary
drilling operations: surface finish, hole straightness, and even hole
positioning can tolerate quite a lot of slop. (If you countersink the holes,
they can be off by quite a bit as long as it doesn't break the probe.) But
microdrilling --- drilling holes of under 0.5mm --- apparently poses special
problems in chip removal and cooling.</p>
<p>Other manufacturing processes might make more sense than drilling. For example,
you could conceptually cut the chunk into 33 pieces along 32 lines of holes,
cast the 33 pieces using lost-wax casting, and then clamp them together. Or you
could make a mold with 1024 adjustable-height rods stuck in through holes in
the cope, and cast in that. (Maybe in plastic.) Etc.</p>
<h3>What a LUT is good for</h3>
<p>So that’s a LUT with 10 bits of input — one of 32 possible positions
in two independent axes, positioning the needle probe over the array
of holes — and 5 bits of output — one of 32 possible depths for the
needle — realized in about a cubic inch. That’s also about 5120 bits,
or 640 8-bit bytes.  That’s enough to realize an arbitrary 32-state
state machine with 5 bits of input at each step, or to perform 4-bit
binary addition or subtraction with carry-in and carry-out and an
extra input bit left over (say, to select between addition and
subtraction), or to perform a selectable one of four arbitrary 5-bit
combinational functions on two 4-bit inputs --- say, addition with
carry out, AND, XOR, and something else.</p>
<p>If you split the same 1024 holes into two LUTs with ganged input —
that is, two probes — then you get 9 bits of input and 10 bits of
output.  A 4x5-bit multiply needs only 9 bits of output.  You could do
a 4x4-bit multiply in half the area and half the depth.</p>
<p>All of these applications still work just as well if any or all of the
quantities are encoded in some weird way such as a Gray code or an
excess-N code.</p>
<p>At some point you have to encode the 32 slightly different linear
displacements into five distinct bits.  You can do this with a
32x5-hole LUT, with five probes sticking into it, and only two
distinct hole depths.</p>
<p>Decoding five bits encoded in five separate displacements into 32
levels of displacement in a small number of moving parts is maybe more
difficult.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://opencores.org/project,zpu,overview">ZPU project</a> on OpenCores is a 32-bit CPU; realized in a
Xilinx FPGA of LUTs, it uses “442 LUT @ 95 MHz after P&amp;R w/32 bit
datapath Xilinx XC3S400”.  I don’t remember offhand how big the
XC3S400 LUTs are, but they have only single-bit outputs.</p>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>A shaft that can slide freely is merely transmitting positional
information from one place to another. A shaft that has a clamp closed
on it can remember its position from before the clamp was closed until
the clamp reopens. If the clamp and shaft surfaces are not flat, the
shaft can be retained in any of its valid positions (reshaping the
signal) with very little force and comparatively imprecise surfaces.</p>
<p>This allows you to store, say, 40 bits with nine moving parts: eight
shafts (each encoding 5 bits) and one clamp for all of them.</p>
<h4>Shift registers in LUTs</h4>
<p>You can make an 8-bit shift register out of two 4×4 → 4 bit LUTs and
two 4-bit memory units (known as registers) if you are willing for it
to always shift; each LUT given (a, b) computes (a &lt;&lt; 1 &amp; 15 | (b &amp; 8)</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3), which is written to its memory unit for the next cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The communication from the low nibble LUT to the high nibble must be
intermediated through the memory; this allows both LUTs to transition
at the same time and means that the bit being shifted into the high
nibble is the old MSB of the low nibble, not the new one.  Using 
(b &amp; 8) &gt;&gt; 3 means you don’t need to decode the LUT output.</p>
<p>The contents of the LUT (two four-bit inputs producing one four-bit
output) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>array([[ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14,  0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14],
       [ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14,  0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14],

       [ 1,  3,  5,  7,  9, 11, 13, 15,  1,  3,  5,  7,  9, 11, 13, 15],
       [ 1,  3,  5,  7,  9, 11, 13, 15,  1,  3,  5,  7,  9, 11, 13, 15],

</code></pre>
<p>Clearly you can reduce this to a 4×1 → 4 bit LUT if you have a way to
extract just one bit from the b input.  For example, you could use a 4
→ 1 bit LUT: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.  You could perhaps
integrate this into the memory from which it’s being read, as an
additional row of holes with a probe over it.</p>
<p>If you have a way to do that, you have space to include an opcode that
tells the register what to do.  For example, shift left, remain
steady, shift right, or reset to 0.  If you have a way to combine this
opcode, the MSB of the less-significant nibble, and the LSB of the
more-significant nibble into a single 4-bit input
<code>b = LSB | MSB &lt;&lt; 1 | opcode &lt;&lt; 2</code>, your table can look like this
instead.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def shift(a, b):

</code></pre>
<p>All of the above generalizes to N-bit shift registers; you just need a
LUT and a register for every four bits.</p>
<h4>Addition</h4>
<p>Parallel addition (the usual digital kind) with inputs and outputs as
the usual kind of binary numbers (not carry-save addition) can’t be
done totally in parallel; the carry from the least-significant bits
must be ready before the most-significant bits can produce their final
result.</p>
<p>But still, with 4×3 → 4 LUTs we can do three bits at a time.  We bring
in the carry along with one of the inputs; the LUT looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(a, b):
...     carry_in, inb = (b &amp; 8) &gt;&gt; 3, b &amp; 7

<p>This gives you, for example, 9-bit addition in three levels of LUT,
plus whatever it takes to shuffle the bits around appropriately.</p>
<h4>Bit shuffling</h4>
<p>In several of the previous items I have assumed a way to combine bits
from disparate sources into a single positional input, or to drop
bits.  This problem also occurs on input.  I hope there’s a better way
to do this, but one workable way is to use a LUT.  I’ve pointed out
earlier that a 4×0 → 1 bit LUT can select a single bit, but you can do
things more generally.  For example, in the shift-register case, where
we want to combine a neighbor MSB possibly being shifted left, an LSB
possibly being shifted right, and a two-bit opcode, we can use two
small LUTs:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Numeric.array([[(opcode &lt;&lt; 1 | msb) for opcode in range(8)] for msb in range(2)])
array([[ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14],
       [ 1,  3,  5,  7,  9, 11, 13, 15]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; Numeric.array([[(opcodemsb &lt;&lt; 1 | lsb) for opcodemsb in range(16)] for lsb in range(2)])
array([[ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30],
       [ 1,  3,  5,  7,  9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31]])
</code></pre>
<p>If we have to simultaneously extract the msb and lsb from the nibbles
they’re embedded in, it is best to do this differently:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Numeric.array([[(leftneighbor &amp; 1 | (rightneighbor &amp; 8) &gt;&gt; 2) 
...  for leftneighbor in range(16)] for rightneighbor in range(16)])

<p>It would require many fewer LUT entries to extract those bits in a
separate step.</p>
<h3>Circles instead of lines: rotational motion is simpler</h3>
<p>Mechanically, moving things linearly is a little trickier than moving
them in circles — there tends to be more slop.  If you transpose this
“height field” LUT into cylindrical coordinates, you get a camshaft.
The normal sliding cam follower design imposes limits on the “slew
rate” of the output function, but if you lift the “cam follower” while
rotating the shaft and then use the same forest of holes and “lowering
step” as with the flat X-Y approach.</p>
<p>Cylindrical coordinates still leave two coordinates translational,
though.  You can cheat a little bit by doing the axial positioning
along a large-radius arc that almost parallels the axis of the
camshaft, to within the diameter of the camshaft, rather than in a
strictly translational fashion.</p>
<p>A third coordinate system that might be useful approximates two
translational dimensions with angles around two axes that are some
distance apart; for example, any two discs that overlap, while
rotating around their own centers.  This allows one dimension to “wrap
around”, as with the camshaft approach.</p>
<h2>Digital logic with thread</h2>
<p>Thread is very nonlinear in some ways, and it’s easy to build thread
systems with very nonlinear force-displacement curves. Thread also has
the advantage that, because the material is not stressed in
compression, its effective stiffness-to-weight ratio is enormous, so
it can transmit signals quickly, and the energy needed to move it is
slight.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the force-displacement curve of a system made of
elastic thread tied between a bunch of fixed points is monotonic; that
is, if you pull on a loose bit of the thread, the force with which the
thread pulls back on you always goes up as you pull it further from
its natural position. (There may be some trick with knots that
violates this.) This imposes limits on pure thread systems, although
you can still get amplification through braking.</p>
<h3>Thread springs</h3>
<p>A steel guitar string can easily be pulled a substantial fraction of
an inch out of place, because although steel is very stiff, the d[cos
x] / dx = 0 when x=0, so even very small elongations of the string
allow substantial movement. (And the force-displacement curve is very
nonlinear.)</p>
<p>This effect can be chained: if you have a thread configuration shaped
like a capital H, you can pull up or down on the middle of the H’s
crossbar fairly easily, because it only has to pull slightly on the
sides of the H in order to move. So you get a lot of mechanical
advantage, we could say.</p>
<p>So this kind of spring force can allow for reciprocating movement in
response to a reciprocating input force pulling on some “power supply”
thread.</p>
<h3>Thread power amplification through braking</h3>
<p>For fanout, we need the ability for one logical gate output to,
eventually, control an arbitrarily large number of logical
outputs. This can’t be achieved just by having strings pull on each
other in configurations like that described above; the amount of force
needed would go up with the number of output stages, which prevents
useful computation.</p>
<p>But braking can provide amplification. Imagine that you have a thread
running along the surface of a cylinder; it can slide freely, as far
as it as long as no force presses it against the cylinder. If another
thread is wrapped loosely several times around the cylinder and the
sliding thread, the sliding thread can still slide; but if the wrapped
thread is then pulled taut, it presses the sliding thread against the
cylinder, preventing it from sliding.</p>
<p>The crucial aspect here is that, although there is a limit to how much
force the thread brake can resist, it can resist that force regardless
of how far the sliding thread would slide without that resistance; and
it can do it with an almost arbitrarily small displacement of its onw.</p>
<p>There are other approaches to braking that might turn out to be
worthwhile; for example, if the wrapped thread clamps the sliding
thread between two cylinders, then they can be in contact with
different kinds of surface with different coefficients of friction,
and the sliding thread won’t catch and pull on the wrapped thread. But
those approaches involve moving more mass.</p>
<p>Braking also provides memory, since the amplified signal happens later
than the amplifier input.</p>
<h3>Thresholding with thread</h3>
<p>There are a couple of approaches to getting the kind of nonlinear
behavior you need for AND or OR gates.</p>
<p>If you have a couple of threads pulling against a spring, the spring’s
displacement will be a function of the sum of the force from those
threads. If the spring’s force-displacement curve is monotonic and
nonlinear enough, you can use it to approximate the AND or OR
functions.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the force-displacement function of a thread tied to a
fixed point has a huge nonlinearity as it runs out of slack: while
it’s slack, the force is basically zero.</p>
<h3>Limiting displacement with thread</h3>
<p>If you couple two threads through a spring, you can use either of the
thresholding techniques in the previous section to limit the
displacement of the driven thread without limiting the displacement of
the driving thread. This costs energy (the spring continues to store
energy as the driving thread pulls further) and also loses some
displacement, as the displacement transmitted to the driven thread
will always be less than the displacement of the driving thread.</p>
<h3>Changing direction with thread, and increasing displacement</h3>
<p>If you have a thread tied to a fixed point, its end describes a circle
around that fixed point when it’s under a small amount of tension. If
the fixed point is far away, the circle approximates a straight line.</p>
<p>If you have another thread tied to that end at an angle not parallel
or perpendicular to (that part of) the circle, that other thread will
be able to pull it along the circle; so you can change the direction
of motion that way by anything less than 90°. If you have a second
thread pulling the other way, also at an an angle neither parallel nor
perpendicular, then displacement is transmitted between the two
threads, but can be changed by any angle at all.</p>
<p>If the angles made to the tangent line are equal, then the same
displacement and force is transmitted, with no mechanical advantage,
or rather a mechanical advantage of unity. But you can achieve MAs of
either above or below 1 by having one angle be greater than the other.</p>
<p>This allows you to convert a small displacement with great force into
a large displacement with small force, and vice versa. (There will be
vibrational losses, but they can probably be made small.) It is that
ability to reduce forces to the point where they can easily be
controlled by braking, then step them back up, that makes me confident
in the braking mechanism as a means of amplification.</p>
<h3>Negation with thread</h3>
<p>If ones and zeroes are represented by different displacements when the
countervailing force is within a certain range, then negation can be
achieved by pulling in the opposite direction against a spring force.</p>
<h3>Sequencing with thread</h3>
<p>If you have a cord with a number of threads tied to it with different
amounts of slack in them, then when you pull on the cord, the various
threads will go taut and begin to transmit force one after the
other. This, plus limiting displacement as discussed previously,
allows you to drive different parts of a thread logic system in a
predetermined sequence.</p>
<h3>A generic thread state machine</h3>
<p>Initially, you have a number of “register” threads R0 braked into some
position or other by threads wrapped around them, held taut by
springs. A few stages of thread combinational logic are driven from
those positions, producing a thread combinational output C0.</p>
<p>You begin to pull on the clock thread. This drives a final stage of
combinational logic connecting the thread combinational output C0 to
another set of registers R1, whose braking threads are currently lax,
so their threads are free to slide back and forth — which they do,
under the influence of your clock thread, pulling against the inputs
of another set of combinational logic producing a second combinational
output C1.</p>
<p>Once the R1 threads have found their position, your further pulling on
the clock thread is transferred to their brake threads, which hold
them in place, preventing the combinational output C1 from changing
further.</p>
<p>Further pulling on the clock thread loosens the tension on the brake
threads for R0, allowing those registers to assume their new state —
which is coupled in from C1! There is vibration as previously slack
threads snap taut, and the outputs of C0 (driven from R0) change. But
R1’s threads are still held in place.</p>
<p>Now you begin to release the tension on the clock thread. First the
brake threads on R0 become taut again, preventing R0’s value from
changing. Then the brake threads for R1 loosen, and R1’s threads are
free to assume the new values of C1’s output, so there is more
vibration as previously slack threads snap taut.</p>
<p>Further loosening of the clock thread tension eases R1’s state threads
back into a neutral position.</p>
<p>Now R0 has its new state, and is ready to begin a new clock cycle.</p>
<p>This is similar to the functioning of a master-slave flip-flop, with
its input driven from its output, but of course with arbitrary
combinational logic.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried to build this yet, but from the above, I think it’s
plausible.</p>
<p>To me, there’s a strong appeal in the idea that universal computation
has been within the grasp of human materials and manufacturing
technology since the invention of sewing in the Paleolithic; it is
only the mathematical sophistication that was absent. I don’t yet know
if it’s true.</p>
