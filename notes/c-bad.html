(4 minutes)</div><p>The other day I was helping a friend of mine with a bug in his C
program.  It turned out that he hadn't initialized a variable that was
used as an in-out parameter, carrying a buffer length on the way into
a Win32 API function, and the length of the data in the buffer on the
way out; and consequently the function was failing with an error,
which he didn't check for.  This took me about 45 minutes to figure
out, talking with him, partly because my Win32 is pretty rusty.  It
would have taken a much longer time if he hadn't been fairly competent
himself, having very nearly figured out the problem before we talked.</p>
<p>I asked why he was writing the program in C, where both of the two
bugs that combined to create this problem were possible, instead of,
Python, Java, OCaml, C#, Haskell, or really any high-level programming
language.  His answer surprised me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we do everything at my work in C or C++<br />
I'm sure that almost makes you puke</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said that was stupid.  C is a beautiful language, but that doesn't
make it the best tool to use for everything.  Quartz crystals are
beautiful too, but if you build a bridge by gluing quartz crystals
together, it's going to take a lot of work, and when you're done, your
bridge is still likely to be fragile.  (Although, if you do it right,
it will be beautiful.)  Much better to build your bridge by welding
steel I-beams together, maybe using some cables to bear its weight.</p>
<p>Descending from analogy to reality, working large programs are built
by incrementally improving working small programs.  There are four
major reasons that each incremental improvement to a C program takes
longer than the corresponding improvement to a program in a
higher-level language:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The C program contains a lot more code than the corresponding
   higher-level program, which makes it harder to find the parts you
   need to change, and harder to understand them well enough to change
   them when you find them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new code you add is several times as large, with the
   consequence that it contains several times as many opportunities
   for bugs, and therefore probably several times as many bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In C, cause and effect are not localized.  If any part of the
   program invokes some kinds of undefined behavior (uninitialized
   data, out-of-bounds pointers, double-frees, and so on), then it can
   interact with any other part of the program at all.  This kind of
   spooky action-at-a-distance makes debugging difficult --- a newly
   manifesting bug may be caused by an error introduced in any part at
   all of the code.  The traditional Unix solution to this problem is
   to <em>not write large programs</em>: instead, write small programs that
   do one thing only (“and do it well”), and then connect them
   together with a scripting language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first three points are, in part, related to the absence of
   garbage collection in C; but garbage collection not only reduces
   the amount of code in your program and helps to keep cause and
   effect localized, it also has other benefits.  For example, it
   reduces coupling between modules, since the interfaces don't have
   to specify who owns memory allocations when.  It improves
   performance, usually (although it reduces the predictability of
   performance).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C toolchains are suboptimal; you often have to futz with
   Makefiles and compiler options, compilation has to be manually
   invoked and takes long enough that you have to wait for it, and
   when you make a mistake in your Makefile, you often end up with a
   program that crashes or otherwise mysteriously misbehaves until you
   <code>make clean; make</code>.</p>
