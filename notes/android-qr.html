(2 minutes)</div><p>Alejandra’s cellphone automatically scans QR codes when they show up
in the camera app, popping up a translucent notification.  If they are
a Mecard (or presumably a VCARD) it offers to add a contact, attaching
the photo from which the QR code was snagged.  If they are text, it
displays about the first 27 characters of it, displaying newlines as
spaces, and offers a chance to copy it to the clipboard.  If they
begin with “http:” (I guess?) it has a “chain link” button to follow
the link.  Gzipped data shows up as a question mark in a diamond, the
“substitute” symbol.</p>
<p>Presumably it also supports vCalendar and Wi-Fi network codes.</p>
<p>Encoding life.py (1987 bytes) resulted in a QR code it failed to
recognize.  However, angleadd.py (1060 bytes) resulted in a scannable
QR code, which resulted in text that could be pasted into a notepad,
containing the full Python program; however, this doesn’t work
reliably.  With -s 1 and the default PNG type in qrencode, I get a
117×117 barcode.  fraktur.py (566 bytes, 89×89) worked somewhat more
reliably, including at 2×2 pixels per module (which I guess means 50
modules per inch?); the UTF-8 decoded properly but most of the Fraktur
glyphs are missing from the phone’s fontset.</p>
<p>Alejandra installed an QR-code scanner from F-Droid, and it was able
to scan the Mecard, but it didn’t recognize it as a Mecard.</p>

more details, though from a 2016 perspective.</p>

talks about Mecard vs. VCARD in 2011.  Apparently by then Mecard was
actually more widely supported than VCARD.</p>
