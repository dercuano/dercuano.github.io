(7 minutes)</div><p>Several times I’ve started writing a mail reader.  More than once I’ve
gotten something I used for a while, then stopped.</p>
<h2>Shape of the problem</h2>
<p>I currently have 4.8 gigabytes of incoming email on adjuvant, which
goes back to 2014, and a 1-gibibyte sample on my laptop.  My laptop’s
SSD is capable of 77 MB/s, or 13 seconds per gigabyte.</p>
<h3>Compression for faster access</h3>
<p>lz4 can fail to compress 300 MB/s on its CPU, or compress a gibibyte
of this mail by about 40% in about 20.0 seconds, of which only 3.1 are
user time (suggesting the other 16.9 were waiting on the SSD).  The
818-megabyte compressed file decompressed in 2.0 user seconds and 12.2
wallclock seconds.  This suggests using LZ4 is capable of getting a
modest storage speedup and saving about a gigabyte.</p>
<p>gzip -1 gets it down to 638 megabytes, and can decompress it in 18.3
seconds (16 seconds user, 2.5 seconds kernel).  This suggests that
gzip is actually nearly as fast as the SSD!  pigz actually gets the
time down to 11.6 seconds, suggesting that gzip -1 is actually
<em>faster</em> than lz4 -1 here, because it gets substantially better
compression and so can more effectively use the disk bandwidth.</p>
<p>lz4 -9 takes 78" to compress the file down to 779 megabytes; the
resulting file can be decompressed in 3.1 seconds from warm cache, but
reading it from the disk still takes 14 seconds.</p>
<p>pigz -9 compresses the file to 610 megabytes in 35", and the resulting
file decompresses (with pigz) in 13.4" (10.6" user, 1.4" system).</p>
<p>In sum, compression might be some kind of a win, but probably not much
of one, and it’s easy for it to be a loss.  lz4 -1 is probably pretty
reasonable, but it’s still slower than memcpy.</p>
<h3>Linear access speeds</h3>
<p>I’d like to be able to do full-text search on the mailbox in a
reasonable amount of time.  <code>grep ajgwio</code> takes 1.0 user seconds and
1.0 system seconds (and 14.4 wallclock seconds) to read through the
gibibyte (already in memory!) and find no matches.</p>
<p><code>grep '^From '</code> takes 110 milliseconds and finds 5838 messages,
giving a mean message size of a bit under 200K.  However, this is
wrong; <code>grep -a '^From '</code> gives 41630 messages and takes 870 ms
wallclock, 500 ms user and 480 ms kernel, providing a more reasonable
message size of 26K.</p>
<p><code>grep -a ajgw</code> yields some 25 random hits in 1300 ms wallclock, 820 ms
user, 430 ms system.  These are entirely in base64 data.  <code>grep -a
'zines de villa urquiza'</code>, a literal string that occurs in four
subject lines, takes 730 ms wallclock, 260 ms user, 450 ms system.  It
seems to be reading with read(), initially in 32768-byte chunks and
eventually in half-mebibyte chunks, with some 17000 system calls,
which seems like an inefficient approach in this case, but it does
seem to be taking substantially less time with the longer search
string.  And it avoids the problems of mmap().  Even <code>LANG=C fgrep -Ua
'We still need more volunteers to watch the Tor community and report'</code>
still takes 620 ms wallclock, 230 ms user, 400 ms system.</p>
<p>Previous experiments on this laptop suggest 300 ns per system call
plus 171 ps per byte, or 171 ns per kilobyte.  This suggests copying
the data takes 184 milliseconds, and doing the system call entries and
exits should take about another 5 milliseconds.  This is about half of
the actual kernel time alone observed, so perhaps part of the problem
is mere cache misses.</p>
<p>Previous experiments on this laptop have found a memcpy speed of about
3 gigabytes/second for files of a few kilobytes and 1.9
gigabytes/second for larger files, which seems like it could easily
account for the extra runtime.</p>
<p>Probably this indicates that we could scan through data already in RAM
at 6 gigabytes per second, but the laptop only has 4 gigabytes of RAM,
so the mailbox won’t fit in RAM.  And reading it into RAM would take
nearly a minute!  Even with pigz, it would take 45 seconds.  That’s
not an acceptable keystroke response time.</p>
<h3>Storing an index in LevelDB</h3>
<p>It’s clear that I can’t get by with just linear scans for searching,
not with almost five gigabytes of email.</p>
<p>LevelDB on my laptop can insert 62 million small records into a
LevelDB in 3'24".  The result is 516 megabytes, or 8.3 bytes per
record.  I haven’t measured how many queries per second it can handle
but I assume it’s pretty adequate.</p>
<p>I think this is probably inadequate performance for insertion, though,
even assuming it remains constant for larger datasets.  A somewhat
typical message contains 250 words of body text (more or less 250
unique, too) in 5 kilobytes of message; perhaps a mean message
contains 1000 unique words.  Then LevelDB will be able to handle the
insertion of only about 300 messages per second.  The 41630 messages
in my sample gibibyte would take a bit over two minutes; the whole
mailbox would take about ten minutes.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what?  Ten minutes to index my last three years of
mail doesn’t sound unusably slow.  I should give it a try.</p>
<h3>Syncing</h3>
<p>I need to be able to get the mail from the server, which means running
some kind of code on the server.  I could upload a separate Python
program, or I could send a bunch of shell commands, including over a
pipe to an ssh process or something.  Or I could do something really
weird like upload bytecode for some kind of immutable virtual machine.</p>
<p>I also need some way to limit the amount of disk space I use locally.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>For writing workflow stuff I probably want Python, or maybe JS or
something.  But for handling large volumes of data quickly, or for
that matter for guaranteed UI responsiveness, I probably don’t.
Certainly not Python, not even PyPy I think.</p>
<p>I don’t know how much of a hassle it would be to call LevelDB via
ctypes or cffi.  It’s pretty easy in C++, and writing a little
C-callable C++ API that does what I need should be pretty easy, too.
And then calling it from ctypes should be pretty easy.</p>
<p>...there’s already a LevelDB binding for Python!</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
