(3 minutes)</div><p>In work with financial market data, I often want to do computations on
time series data.  I’d like to be able to specify the computations in
a way that isn’t, for example, coupled to a sampling rate.  I’d like
to be able to specify a computation once and then efficiently perform
it on any of the following, without editing the code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time data as it becomes available.</li>
<li>Regularly sampled historical data.</li>
<li>Irregularly sampled historical data on my laptop.</li>
<li>Irregularly sampled historical data on some Amazon EC2 nodes.</li>
<li>Conservatively approximated historical data.</li>
<li>Specific randomly generated data.</li>
<li>Specified mostly continuous (though not necessarily
  piecewise-constant) functions.</li>
<li>Probability distributions of data.</li>
<li>An incremental variation of a previous dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I want to be able to interactively create models and visualize
the results.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I will be able to achieve this, but I can achieve most of
it.</p>
<p>There are three main time-series data types I am dealing with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partial functions, which map some subset of the timeline to values
  such as $301.50, Wednesday, false, or 3%, with at most a countable
  number of discontinuities.</li>
<li>Finite mostly-continuous subsets of the timeline, which can be
  thought of as boolean partial functions that happen to be defined
  everywhere.</li>
<li>Events, which are countable numbers of points on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are functions between these data types.  The discontinuities of
a function or the beginnings and endings of a subset are events; given
start events and end events you can create a subset; a boolean
function can be converted to a subset of the timeline, and you can
extract the domain of any function; you can restrict a function to be
valid only within a subset; and you can discard events outside a
subset.</p>
<p>Operations on the values mapped to by partial functions can be lifted
to operate pointwise over those functions, intersecting their domains.</p>
<p>Finally, you can coalesce partial functions, SQL-style.</p>
<p>All of the above operations are nearly memoryless.  However, there are
also a set of <em>causal</em> operations available.  The simplest is simply a
lag, applicable to functions, subsets, and events; but others are also
available.  They are defined as a generalization of integration (in
some sense numerical integration rather than symbolic integration),
with an arbitrary semigroup operation used in place of addition, and
another arbitrary lifting operation used in place of multiplication by
a step size.  This permits, for example, computing a window of the
last ten minutes of updates.</p>
<p>Requiring the “multiplication” operation to be a semigroup operation
(i.e. associative) permits efficient parallelization and
incrementalization.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
