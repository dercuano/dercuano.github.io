<p>Here I want to talk about some things to try for sparse filter design
that might extend its range considerably.</p>
<h2>What I mean by “sparse filters”</h2>
<p><a href="../notes/sparse-filters.html">Sparse filters</a> outlines some basic techniques for designing
digital filters that require only a few inexpensive operations per
sample, <a href="../notes/sparse-kernel-cascade-gabor-approximation.html">Image filtering with an approximate Gabor wavelet or Morlet wavelet using a cascade of sparse convolution kernels</a> demonstrates
how to get an almost arbitrary approximate 2-D Gabor wavelet from
under 30 additions and subtractions.  <a href="../notes/convolution-bokeh.html">Real-time bokeh algorithms, and other convolution tricks</a>
describes some ways to do precise flat convolution filters in 2-D
sparsely, and <a href="../notes/svd-convolution.html">The miraculous low-rank SVD approximate convolution algorithm</a> describes some once-well-known
ways to do very inexpensive approximate convolution using a
singular-value decomposition of the desired convolution
kernel — approaches that do require multiplications, but fewer.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom, as I understand it, is to use direct-form FIR
filters, with their non-sparse array of coefficients which gains
nothing from cascading (you might as well just convolve the two arrays
of coefficients and get a single-stage FIR kernel with one fewer
multiplication per sample to do), and IIR filters without any delay
elements in them, ideally realized as a cascade of second-order
sections, applied bidirectionally if you need linear phase delay.  The
Hogenauer filter, Karplus-Strong string synthesis, and PLLs hint that
it’s possible to do dramatically better, especially on computers and
FPGAs where delay memory is nearly free but multiplication is
expensive; but we still lack a theory of how to design such things.</p>
<p>If you convolve two FIR filters whose impulse responses are <em>m</em> and
<em>n</em> samples long, the resulting impulse responses is <em>m</em> + <em>n</em> - 1
samples long.  But, even without resorting to non-LTI filters, if you
convolve two FIR filters whose impulse responses contain <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>
nonzero elements, possibly with zero elements between them, the
resulting impulse response may have as many as <em>mn</em> nonzero elements.
So if you convolve <em>n</em> FIR filters each containing only two nonzero
samples, you can get a FIR filter with 2<em>ⁿ</em> nonzero samples, if there
is never any overlap.  This allows you to get a 2<em>ⁿ</em>-tap FIR filter
with only <em>n</em> multiplications — but not <em>any</em> 2<em>ⁿ</em>-tap FIR filter,
only certain special ones, ones which are as far as I know not very
interesting.  Still, the possibility is open that we can do
exponentially better than we have done so far.</p>
<p>More interestingly, there are certain convolutions of FIR and IIR
filters which produce FIR rather than IIR filters; this allows you to
get, say, a zero-phase bandpass filter at any frequency with a
selectable and arbitrarily high Q — perhaps 1000 or 100'000 — with six
to ten additions and subtractions per sample.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>The basic techniques I’m using are CIC or Hogenauer filters; comb
filters, especially negative-feedback comb filters; linear filter
composition, convolving their time-domain responses; filter addition,
adding their time-domain responses; and zero-phase filter inversion.</p>
<p>(The notes in this section probably are not an adequate introduction
to the subject, but hopefully are sufficient to tell if I have
something basic wrong with my understanding; <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/">The Scientist’s and
Engineer’s guide to DSP</a> is a much better
introduction.)</p>
<p>The basic Hogenauer filter is a boxcar low-pass filter built from a
marginally stable recursive integrator and a feedforward comb filter;
its response in the time domain is a pulse, which is of course finite,
and in the frequency domain it’s a sinc.  Most commonly they’re used
for sample rate downconversion — you cascade two to four of them to
get a Gaussian response in both domains, rearrange the order of the
stages to put the integrators first, and decimate in between to reduce
the memory requirement on the comb filters.  Then, typically, you use
a direct-form FIR filter at the lower rate to flatten out the
passband.</p>
<p>Feedforward comb filters amount to adding the input signal to a
delayed and possibly inverted version of itself; by destructive
interference, this perfectly cancels frequencies for whom the delay is
an odd number of half-cycles, or a whole number of cycles if inverted.
Nearby frequencies are attenuated, but the notch is pretty sharp.
They also amplify broad ranges of frequencies in between the notches
by as much as 6 dB, those for which the interference is constructive.
Negative-feedforward comb filters eliminate DC bias, and more
generally they have a high-pass effect up to half of their first null
frequency; positive-feedforward comb filters double DC bias.
Feedforward comb filters’ impulse responses consist of pairs of
impulses.</p>
<p>Unity-gain <em>feedback</em> comb filters are marginally stable: their
impulse response is an infinite impulse train, alternating in sign if
gain is negative.  Instead of sharp nulls, they have sharp resonances,
with infinite gain in fact; the positive-feedback ones have resonances
at the period of their lag and all its harmonics (including zero),
while the negative-feedback ones have resonances at twice the period
of their lag and its odd harmonics.  So negative-feedback comb filters
resonate at the frequencies that a positive-feedforward comb filter
with the same lag would cancel, and positive-feedback comb filters
resonate at the frequencies that a negative-feedforward comb filter
with the same lag would cancel.</p>
<p>If you replace the marginally-stable integrator in a Hogenauer filter
with a marginally-stable unity-feedback comb filter — positive or
negative — then instead of integrating the DC component of the input,
it starts integrating a pulse-train component of the input.  (You need
to make sure that the following stabilizing feedforward comb filter is
canceling in-phase components of that pulse train.)  This transforms
the Hogenauer filter from a low-pass filter into a bandpass filter,
one that responds equally at a fundamental frequency and either all
its harmonics, including DC (if the feedback comb uses positive
feedback) or just its odd harmonics (if it uses negative feedback).
Its window is a boxcar and so its frequency-domain response is just a
sinc, or rather a periodic, infinite sequence of sincs, so usually you
need to cascade this one too.  A cascade of three or more provides a
quite good approximation to a Gabor wavelet.</p>
<p>Cascading or composing filters convolves their time-domain impulse
response and multiplies their frequency response; in particular this
means that if a filter has zero response at some frequency, then so
will any cascade of linear filters including it.</p>
<p>Given two or more filters, you can connect them to the same input and
add together their outputs.  The time-domain impulse response will be
the sum of their individual responses, which is straightforward, and
so will the frequency-domain impulse response, which is not
straightforward, because the frequency-domain response is in general
complex.  So if two filters both amplify a certain frequency by 3 dB,
their sum might amplify it by 3 dB, or by 9 dB, or they might cancel
it out completely, or anything in between, depending on their relative
phase.</p>
<p>For this reason it’s often convenient to design with linear-phase
filters, those whose impulse response is time-reversal-symmetric†, like
the boxcar or an equal pair of impulses.  By delaying your other
signals relative to a linear-phase filter, you can make it a
<em>zero-phase filter</em>, whose impulse response is time-reversal-symmetric
<em>around zero time</em>.  Linear-phase filters include boxcars, Gaussians,
unity-gain positive-feedforward comb filters, and the bandpass variant
of the Hogenauer filter described above — as long as its time-domain
response has an <em>odd number</em> of half-wavelengths in it.  They also
include arbitrary convolutions of linear-phase filters and arbitrary
sums of zero-phase filters.</p>
<p><em>Inversion</em> is subtracting the null filter — the input signal — from a
zero-phase, appropriately-scaled low-pass filter, converting it into a
high-pass filter.  This is very demanding of the low-pass filter,
though: 1 dB of passband droop in the low-pass part is going to limit
stopband attenuation to a miserable -10 dB!</p>
<p>† These have <em>even</em> time-domain response.  Filters with <em>odd</em>
time-domain response are <em>also</em> linear-phase but I don’t know how to
make them zero-phase other than, I guess, convolving them with another
filter with odd time-domain response to get a filter with even
time-domain response.  There are other linear-phase filters which are
weighted sums of odd and even filters with the same frequency
response, but I have no idea how to take advantage of that.</p>
<h2>Flattening out the passband without a direct-form FIR filter</h2>
<p>As I said above, it’s common to use a direct-form FIR filter to
flatten out the passband of a CIC filter when you use it for rate
downconversion.  The idea is that you can run just the integrators,
which just do an addition per sample, at the high sample rate, to get
a kind of floppy low-pass-filtered signal that anyway doesn’t have any
significant signal left up at the top end to alias when you decimate
it; then you can clean up that droopy passband at the lower sample
rate where you have time for lots of computation per sample.</p>
<p>But what if you aren’t using the Hogenauer filter for downconversion?
What if you want a bandpass filter (using the variant I described
above) or, God forbid, you want to invert the filter and get a
high-pass filter out of it?</p>
<p>Well, it occurs to me that if you want your bandpass filter to have a
somewhat flatter top, you have several alternatives.  First, instead
of cascading several sinc-frequency-response bandpass filters at the
<em>same</em> frequency, you could <em>cascade</em> several at <em>different</em> but
similar frequencies.  The droop in the various frequency responses
will compensate somewhat for the amplification that comes from the
“integrators”.  Second, by using zero-phase bandpass
filters — windowing their pulse-train time-domain response so that
it’s symmetric — you can <em>add</em> several of them in parallel.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to start with a much wider passband than you
need — using a very short window in the time domain — and then
<em>subtract</em> narrower bandpass filters above and below.  Or maybe use
feedforward comb filters to notch out frequencies above and below your
desired passband.</p>
<p>Similarly, I think you can use a broad zero-phase bandpass filter of
the kind described above — maybe with a Q of 2 or so — to shore up the
droopy high end of an orthodox Hogenauer filter’s passband.</p>
<h2>Reducing harmonics of bandpass filters with frequency diversity</h2>
<p>Windowing a feedback comb doesn’t get you just one passband; it gets
you as many passbands as will fit in your sample rate, since either
all the harmonics of the baseband or all the odd harmonics will also
be passbands.  Since you need to cascade a few windowed combs to get
acceptable stopband suppression anyway, you might try detuning them
from each other a bit not only to flatten the desired passband but
also so they mutually weaken one another’s harmonics.  This works
because all the passbands of a feedback comb are equally wide (in
cycles per sample) at, say, their half-power points, but harmonics are
further apart (in cycles per sample) than the fundamental.</p>
<p>This may not be very important since you probably just want to use a
low-pass filter to attenuate those harmonics.</p>
<h2>Low-Q bandpass filters</h2>
<p>Above I pointed out that you can get a Hogenauer-like bandpass filter
with a cascade of a feedback comb like</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>t</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>t</em>] - <em>y</em>[<em>t</em> - 8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and a feedforward comb like</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>t</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>t</em>] + <em>x</em>[<em>t</em> - 24]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to get a finite-time impulse response.  This is very frugal if you
want a lot of oscillations in your window and thus a high Q — you can
get an arbitrarily large number of oscillations with just two adds or
subtracts.  But if you only want a small number of oscillations, for a
filter for a broad range of frequencies, you might as well use a
direct-form FIR filter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>[<em>t</em>] = <em>x</em>[<em>t</em>] - 2<em>x</em>[<em>t</em> - 8] + <em>x</em>[<em>t</em> - 16]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see that these are equivalent by plotting the results of the
following Numpy code:</p>
<pre><code>def feedback_comb(sig, lag, gain):
    rv = sig.copy()
    for i in range(lag, len(rv)):
        rv[i] += gain * rv[i - lag]
    return rv

def feedforward_comb(sig, lag, gain):
    rv = sig.copy()
    rv[lag:] += gain * sig[:-lag]
    return rv

x = zeros(100)
x[2] = 5
y = feedback_comb(x, 8, -1)
z = feedforward_comb(y, 24, 1)
</code></pre>
<h2>Various pulse sizes</h2>
<p>If you have a single integrator connected to your input signal, you
can use several negative-feedforward combs on it to get various sizes
of boxcars out of it.  The same boxcar can be added to itself with
multiple different delays to build the overall shape of a filter
kernel; indeed, going beyond series-parallel combinations, boxcars of
a small number of different sizes can be used, then melted together
with a low-pass filter.</p>
<h2>Splines</h2>
<p>If you convolve two boxcars of the same size you get a triangle
function.  If you convolve that triangle function with a signal
sampled at intervals of the boxcar size — one impulse every boxcar
length, with zeroes in between — you get a linear interpolation of the
signal.  This gives you an easy and fairly sparse way to generate a
filter with piecewise-linear time-domain response, requiring one
multiply per knot in the kernel, per sample.</p>
<p>If you convolve the triangle with itself, you get a piecewise-cubic
approximation of the Gaussian.  This is not a basis spline, but it’s
not far from one; it is a simple linear algebra exercise to express an
arbitrary piecewise-cubic signal with knots at one-boxcar intervals in
the basis of this kernel, shifted by one-boxcar intervals.  (You
convolve the signal at the knots with the representation of the basis
spline in terms of the approximate Gaussian.)  This gives you an only
slightly less easy, and very nearly as sparse, way to generate a
filter with a piecewise-cubic time-domain response, again, requiring
one multiply per knot in the kernel, per sample.</p>
<p>In some cases it might make sense to sum a few different such spline
kernels at different scales to different levels of detail at different
times during the kernel.</p>
<h2>A factitious sinc</h2>
<p>A sinc looks like a Gaussian lump in the middle, a sine wave on the
left that gets smaller on the left, and a sine wave on the right (180°
out of phase with the left one) that gets smaller on the right.  What
if we add together a Gaussian and a few differently delayed copies of
a shortish triangle-windowed oscillation kernel, made out of the
bandpass thing described above?  Could we get a frequency-domain
bandpass response that looks more like sinc’s ideal pulse?</p>
<h2>Other candidates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing a square wave, or in 2-D a zebra pattern, by convolving
  an impulse train (finite-length, windowed, or otherwise) with a
  pulse</li>
<li>Combining filters by multiplication, min, or softmin rather than
  addition to recognize “templates”</li>
<li>Measuring the ac energy along lines at different angles to identify
  the angles which contain most information, before running a more
  expensive operation (perhaps the humans do this when they tilt their
  heads)</li>
<li>Maybe take the FFT of the signal along a line at some angle through
  an image to identify one or two dominant frequencies; the relative
  phases of those dominant frequencies in a nearby parallel line
  (obtainable with Goertzel or with the delay-line techniques
  discussed above) then give you an estimate of the dominant angle of
  lines running across the region between them — maybe cheaper than
  running a cross-correlation on the two lines</li>
<li>Exponential filtering from a recursive non-unity-gain feedback comb
  filter (in any spatial direction, e.g. coma from lens aberration) is
  linear and “sparse” though it requires a multiplication; can you cut
  it down to a finite impulse response in the same way as its special
  cases above, the integrator and the unity-gain feedback comb?  Even
  if not perfectly (e.g., due to rounding error), can you do it well
  enough to make useful IIR approximations of FIR filters?</li>
<li>More generally, piecewise-complex-exponential approximations of
  filter responses</li>
<li><a href="../notes/sparse-kernel-cascade-gabor-approximation.html">Image filtering with an approximate Gabor wavelet or Morlet wavelet using a cascade of sparse convolution kernels</a> laments not having
  a way to rotate the phase of a given frequency 90 degrees without
  phase-shifting much lower frequencies detectably.  Can it be as
  simple as a unity-negative-feedback comb?</li>
<li>Spectral inversion is of course not linear, but it can be applied to
  a signal very cheaply.  If you invert the spectrum of a signal on
  the way in and out of a linear filter, you have inverted the
  frequency response of that filter, though be careful of the delay so
  that you don’t inadvertently invert the signal amplitude.  In
  addition to doing this around ½<em>fₛ</em> by alternating signs on every
  sample, you can do it around ¼<em>fₛ</em> by alternating signs every other
  sample, offering the potential of inverting either the signal
  amplitude or frequency if you get the phase delay wrong</li>
