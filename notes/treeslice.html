(6 minutes)</div><p>So I'm doing this tree-growth simulation thing in slices, where
theoretically we want the total cross-sectional area of the tree to
stay constant through branch points.  That is, the branch before a
fork should have the same total cross-sectional area as the two
branches after it, and also that every intermediate point in the
forking process should have the same cross-sectional area.</p>
<p>The underlying structure is a set of branch center points that move
around in the XY plane as a function of Z, but my current problem is
how to convert that into a three-dimensional shape that has the right
thicknesses, transitions smoothly from one layer to the next, and is
approximately circular around the branch center points.</p>
<p>I've been trying to fake this by putting a circle around each branch
center point and inflating it in such a way that two overlapping
circles with the same center will have twice the area as if there were
just one of them, and doing a radius linear interpolation thing as
their radii get further apart, until they have no overlap at all.
This is not working super well for a couple of reasons: the circles
intersect one another and don't have a way to find corresponding
points to join with a mesh, so they're only a step toward the
two-dimensional shell I want, not the final result; and when more than
two of them overlap because two branch events happened close together
in time or because circles were forced to collide, the resulting
circles are too big, and sometimes discontinuously so.</p>
<p>So it occurred to me that you could solve most of this problem with
some variety of gradient descent.  You have a bunch of boundary points
linked into a bunch of loops.  You're trying to optimize the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The area of each loop is close to the sum of the weights of the
branch center points contained inside it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The difference between the boundary points in this generation and
in the last generation is small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total length of each loop is as short as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loops do not intersect or self-intersect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loops have the right number of points: no more than necessary,
but enough to keep their form well-defined.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of these can be optimized by continuously varying the boundary
points' coordinates, but sometimes you might instead split or join
loops or reorder the points of a loop, which might be done
heuristically.  If you can really differentiate the merit function
with regard to the coordinates, you can do real gradient descent as
such; otherwise, you're stuck with blind hill-climbing search or
genetic algorithms.</p>
<h2>Implicit functions</h2>
<p>Unfortunately most of those things require a lot of geometric
algorithms, and Sedgewick has impressed upon me how tricky those are.
As an alternative, maybe I could use an implicit function, a function
whose zero is a circle of the correct area when it's fed with only a
single branch center, which is computed from the sum of the functions
of the different branch centers, and where the contribution of a
branch center falls off rapidly to zero as you get far away from it.</p>
<p>As an example, you could use a sum of Gaussians centered on each
center point, scaled to match the branch's radius, and subtract 1 from
the sum to get a function with useful zeroes.</p>
<p>However, you'd also want it to be the case that the area of
overlapping branches is the area that would be the sum of the
individual branches, at least in the common case I'm looking at here
where I divide a branch by making two new branches in the same place
whose eventual cross-sectional area, once they separate, will sum to
the cross-sectional area of the original branch.</p>
<p>A necessary but not sufficient condition for this is that the
gaussian-like function of the distance from the center have the
property that doubling the function makes the distance from the center
at which the sum falls to 1 increase by a factor of √2̄.  It happens
that Gaussians do in fact have that property, at least if you double
them!  You can show it by algebra, but you can also do the experiment:</p>
<pre><code>import math
def gaussian(r): return math.exp(-r**2)

def search(f, v, min, max, tolerance):
    fmin, fmax = f(min), f(max)
    assert (fmin - v) * (fmax - v) &lt;= 0
    if tolerance &gt;= abs(fmin - v): return min
    if tolerance &gt;= abs(fmax - v): return max
    mid = (min+max)/2.0
    fmid = f(mid)
    if (fmid - v) * (fmin - v) &lt;= 0:
        return search(f, v, min, mid, tolerance)
    else:
        return search(f, v, mid, max, tolerance)
</code></pre>
<p>This code shows that gaussian(.832554) ≈ 0.5, and 2*gaussian(1.17741)
≈ 0.5.  The ratio between those two is indeed √2̄.  However, it is not
true in general that gaussian(x)/2 = gaussian(x√2̄), although that
shouldn't stop us from using it here.</p>
<p>It seems like if there's an analytic function that has these
properties (minimally, that in general f(x)/2 = f(x√2̄), that it's
always positive and finite, that f(x) = 1 at exactly one positive x,
and that its limit at infinity is zero) it should be unique.</p>
<p>I've already written an interval-arithmetic package in JS that could
be used to efficiently divide the canvas into an implicit k-d tree to
search for zero pixels.  It may need to be enhanced somewhat to look
harder for the zeroes, down into deep subpixel, in order to avoid
false positives.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
