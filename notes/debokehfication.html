(4 minutes)</div><p>Bokeh preserves sharp edges; it just spreads them out.  The
circularly-symmetric boxcar filter of an ideal bokeh has a
circularly-symmetric sinc frequency response in two-dimensional
frequency space, and sinc’s falloff is pretty slow, just 6 dB per
octave.  So even a 32-pixel-wide bokeh is only attenuating
single-pixel detail by about 30 dB.</p>
<p>(Of course, boosting single-pixel noise by 30 dB will add nontrivial
graininess; that’s 5 bits of precision lost, after all.  But some
photos have that degree of precision.)</p>
<p>Indeed, as suggested in <a href="../notes/starfield-servo.html">Starfield servo</a>, under some
circumstances such a bokeh can actually <em>enhance</em> sensor precision,
and it might be preferable to use a large pinhole in front of a sensor
rather than a lens on a camera, both because it gives you a more
precise reading on the position of bright impulses in the visual
field, and because it does a better job of taking advantage of the
limited dynamic range of common image sensors.  The principle is the
same as how R’s default graphic for plotted points is a circle, not
just a point, and in fact a disc in the center of the pinhole would
probably work even better for extending the sensor dynamic range and
precision.
A more elaborate
shadow mask such as a Hadamard matrix could improve this further.</p>
<p>Real camera bokehs tend to not be perfectly flat, even at small
scales; although they don’t include Hadamard-matrix shadow masks, in
addition to spherical aberrations, they do include tiny imperfections
on the lens and lens filters that only add a tiny amount of stray
light to a focused image, but are easily visible in unfocused images
of (near) point source lights.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.B.: This effect might be useful for getting lensless optical
transmission microscopy out of commonplace digital cameras without
taking the lenses off of them: put the slide reasonably close to the
camera, illuminate with one or more out-of-focus point sources,
ideally with some non-overlapping or mostly non-overlapping images
on the focal plane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These imperfections provide additional high-frequency information that
could permit improved estimates of the unblurred image; moreover, in
images that contain at least some bright points, they can provide much
tighter estimates of the defocus of a particular region of the image.
Also, if they are sufficiently strong, they can disambiguate
behind-focal-plane defocus from in-front-of-focal-plane defocus.  (Any
kind of half-turn asymmetry in the bokeh can provide such
disambiguation, including the common feature of approximate
polygonality with an odd number of sides.)</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious approach of removing bokeh by applying Wiener
filters selectively to parts of the image, it might be worthwhile to
try not only convolution with an estimated bokeh shape but also
morphological erosion with it, to identify candidate bright
points — both to improve the estimate of bokeh shape and to measure
the scale of the bokeh in different parts of the image.</p>
<p>Image-processing tricks on the bokeh are not limited to removing it
and doing microscopy with it; you can also do camera identification
(from the lens imperfections) and depth estimation.  You might be able
to correct chromatic aberration.</p>
<p>Bokeh can vary over the focal plane due to, for example, occlusion
from a shroud extending in front of the lens.  If this is recognizable
it should be relatively easy to correct, but more general occlusion
effects cannot be corrected in general — you might have a single light
that’s half-covered by a finger halfway between the camera and the
light, giving a sort of partially-eclipsed-moon bokeh not shared with
much else in the scene.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (123 notes)
