(6 minutes)</div><p>One hot summer night recently, I guided a tourist through the streets
of Palermo, the chichi Buenos Aires neighborhood.  She was enthralled
by the colorful murals that cover the walls of many of the alleyways
(<em>pasajes</em>) and stopped to take many photos.  (Incredibly, during her
entire trip, she didn’t get even a single hand computer stolen, just a
jacket and some colored pencils.)</p>
<p>Her hand computer camera’s wimpy LED flash was not enough to
illuminate the murals clearly; unfortunately she wasn’t able to visit
them during the day.  It occurred to me that it should be possible
with multiple coregistered camera frames to artificially amplify the
brightness of the flash somewhat.</p>
<p>The scheme is as follows.  First, we take some frames with the flash
and other frames without it, and perhaps frames with different
quantities of flash or different exposure times (and variation in
“ISO” gain to compensate for the exposure time).  Then, we coregister
them to find the corresponding pixels.  For each pixel, we compute a
linear regression of its color in each frame against the amount of
flash in that frame; this resolves the various frames into a frame of
“biases” representing the color of the pixel under existing lighting,
a frame of “slopes” representing the per-spectral-band reflectance of
the pixel to the flash, and what we hypothesize is random noise.</p>
<p>This allows us to extrapolate what the image would look like if the
flash had been brighter than it was in fact.  This will amplify errors
and measurement noise to some degree, but if we are amplifying the
flash signal by less than an order of magnitude, the effect should be
small enough not to overwhelm the quality improvement from the added
light.</p>
<p>The flash may cause some pixels to saturate, and saturated or
near-saturated pixels should either be excluded from the linear
regression or given a very small regression weight.  A potentially
worse problem is that the extrapolated image may saturate pixels that
were not saturated in the input images.  This can be handled by doing
the extrapolation with extra bits of precision or in floating point to
handle the larger dynamic range, then translating these linear
high-dynamic-range values to the final image in a way that preserves
as much information as possible.  As I understand it, ACES recommends
using a sigmoid curve per color channel to imitate the
gradual-saturation nonlinear behavior of film emulsions, thus avoiding
the total loss of information in particularly dark or light areas,
providing higher dynamic range in digital images without the spatial
filtering we usually see in HDR images.</p>
<p>Pixels spatially closer to the camera will experience more flash
illumination, at least if we’re using an on-camera flash (typical for
photos from hand computers).  However, they will also experience more
flash illumination if they have higher reflectance, so by itself this
does not turn a camera with an on-camera flash into a depth camera; it
cannot untangle reflectance from closeness to the camera.  If the
non-flash illumination were constant everywhere in the scene, like a
naïve ambient light source in a raytracer without ambient occlusion,
then we could use the ambient light source to derive the raw
reflectance, then divide the flash slope of each pixel by its
reflectance to derive its (inverse square) distance.  However, this
seems unlikely to work in practice.</p>
<p>A different way to take advantage of this phenomenon that might work
better is to use even fairly imprecise SfM depth data derived from
camera parallax to figure out which parts of the image are unusually
close to the camera, then artificially attenuate the flash on them.
This give the effect of a flash positioned further from the scene than
it really is, thus evening out the flash illumination across the scene
somewhat.</p>
<p>If we have this crude SfM data available, we should also be able to
determine that certain pixels are at very nearly the same depth — for
example, nearby pixels on the surface of a single object — so they
should be receiving very nearly the same illumination from the flash.
This means that differences in their flash slopes reliably indicate
differences in their reflectances; this enables local correction of
the “bias” image for reflectance to get an image that is purely a map
of non-flash ilumination (plus non-Lambertian phenomena such as
specular glints).  Since we’re talking about pixels that are close
together in three-space, the <em>intensity</em> of non-flash illumination on
them should be the nearly the same, except in shadows; only its
<em>direction</em> varies.  So we can use this to get information about the
angle between the surface and the non-flash illumination and thus
about its geometry.</p>
<p>Of course, if we have multiple flashes in different positions
available, we can use them to illuminate the scene from different
angles in different frames, thus giving us lots of great information
about surface geometry.  This might sound like an expensive setup that
is unrealistic in most circumstances, but in fact with the advent of
widespread forward-facing cameras on hand computers, it’s eminently
feasible for small objects: the different “flashes” are just different
regions of the screen.  (Some researchers also noted that this allows
you to get nine or twelve channels of spectral information rather than
the usual three, since the spectra of the RGB or RGBW filters on the
screen will usually imperfectly match the spectra of the RGB filters
on the camera focal plane.  Unfortunately, some shithead reporter
mischaracterized the research as providing “hyperspectral”
capabilities, and so most of the commentary I saw focused on debunking
the lie rather than the actual research.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
