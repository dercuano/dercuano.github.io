(4 minutes)</div><p>I’m interested in sparse filters, in the sense that you can realize
them with only a small number of taps to reduce the number of
multiplications, and multiplication-free or multiplication-light
filters, in the sense that the nonzero tap coefficients are numbers
like 1, 2, 3, 4, or maybe 6 or 8, but not things like 1.03594513,
except perhaps in a very few cases.</p>
<p>The Hogenauer cascaded integrator-comb filter is a well-known filter
of this class, commonly used for sample-rate conversion.  But here are
a few other related ideas.</p>
<p>The context for this is that a lot of our filter design lore comes
from the world of analog electronics, where multiplication is trivial
and memory is hard.  This means it is not a good fit for digital
computation, where memory is trivial and multiplication is hard,
although immense hardware effort has been devoted to papering over
this for the benefit of DSP designers.</p>
<p>A CIC filter is low-pass but linear-phase, so you can invert
it — subtracting the appropriately scaled low-pass signal from the
input sample in the middle of the kernel — to get a high-pass filter.
Or you can subtract the outputs of two such filters to get a bandpass
filter.  This may be particularly useful in combination with
undersampling — decimating the bandpass-filtered signal to alias the
band of interest down to IF or baseband, thus allowing you to detect a
high-frequency signal without doing anything high-frequency except for
running some integrators.</p>
<p>A unity-gain negative-feedback comb filter y(n) = x(n) - y(n-k) is an
oscillator, and indeed it’s very close to the Karplus-Strong
oscillator (which is, in its original form, y(n) = x(n) - ½y(n-k) -
½y(n-k-1), to gradually attenuate higher frequencies).  If you compose
it with a unity-gain feedforward comb filter in very much the same way
you do in a CIC filter, its impulse response is a finite-length
alternating impulse train, so it’s a bandpass filter, though it also
detects harmonics of the target frequency.  A cascade of a few of
these approximates a Gaussian window; if you add an actual CIC filter,
which you can tune to have nulls at the harmonics of the target
frequency, you can get a very inexpensive high-Q filter.  As one
example, <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/sparse-bandpass-filters.ipynb">I got a bandpass Q</a> of 17.8 and 38dB stopband attenuation
to generate I and Q signals for oscillations with a period of 60
samples using 2.64 additions and subtractions per sample: a two-stage
CIC filter with lags of 36 and 40 samples on the front end, three
30-sample feedback combs, and further feedforward combs of 300, 480,
and 780 samples.  This gives a kernel with a temporal response of
about 1000 samples (FWHM) which is a reasonably good approximation to
a Gabor filter with Q≈17.</p>
<p>(You’ll note that this is very similar to the previous technique, and
the two may be alternatives; with the previous technique, for example,
it may be useful to set up the low-pass filter you're inverting to
have precise nulls at the harmonics of the signal you're trying to
detect.)</p>
<p>More generally, if you can construct a filter whose impulse response
is half a wave or more of some waveform you want, you can cascade it
with the unity-gain negative-feedback comb filter and get an
oscillator for that waveform, or more or less equivalently, a filter
that matches it.  And you can use the same trick described above to
construct a filter whose impulse response is a specific number of
oscillations of the waveform.</p>
<p>Anything you can construct by convolving, adding, and subtracting box
filters and comb filters can be computed as a sparse filter.  So, for
example, you can get a difference of gaussians fairly easily.</p>
<p>Once we get into nonlinear filter territory, things get more
interesting still.  You can do a PLL as a pretty sparse filter, for
example.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
