(10 minutes)</div><p>I talked a little about Lotus Agenda in <a href="../notes/agenda-hypertext.html">Agenda hypertext</a>.
Today I want to explore a different related idea: a flexible tool for
making relational views of text file contents, whether written by hand
or generated by machine.</p>
<p>An Agenda file was, primarily, an unordered bag of text snippets.  A
lot of Unix utilities treat text file lines as sort of database
records — roughly speaking, <code>sort</code> sorts the records, <code>uniq</code>
eliminates duplicates and possibly provides you with a count, <code>grep</code>
selects records matching a pattern, <code>cut</code> projects away some of the
columns, <code>look</code> does a lookup in a sorted index, <code>join</code> and <code>paste</code> do
relational joins, and so on.</p>
<p>These utilities are often the fastest way to get certain tasks done,
but they’re kind of hard to use (especially robustly), and they don’t
deal with ad-hoc-formatted text at all, which was Agenda’s strength.
However, Agenda’s queries and views used a sort of tagging system that
wasn’t very powerful.</p>
<h2>The basic idea: create relations by pattern-matching text lines</h2>
<p>What if we had a system that also treated a text file as a bag of
lines, but permitted relational queries on those lines, similar to how
Sniki permitted relational queries on its link graph (see <a href="../notes/prolog-table-outlining.html">Prolog table outlining</a>)?  For example, consider these lines:</p>
<pre><code>-rwxr-xr-x   1 user user     19096 Dec 30  2018 xshmucalc_fb
-rw-r--r--   1 user user       254 Dec 30  2018 erosion1d.c.~1~
-rwxr-xr-x   1 user user      8984 Dec 30  2018 erosion1d
-rw-r--r--   1 user user       534 Dec 30  2018 erosion1d-log.c.~1~
-rw-r--r--   1 user user      1122 Dec 30  2018 erosion1d.c
-rw-r--r--   1 user user      1362 Dec 30  2018 erosion1d-log.c
-rw-r--r--   1 user user     40055 Dec 30  2018 erosion1d-log.lst
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose you match them against this pattern, using two PCRE regexps:</p>
<pre><code>-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user $size:\d+ $date:.* $executable
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>executable</code> gets the default pattern \S+; unquoted space matches
any amount of space.)</p>
<p>This produces the following relation:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>size<th>date<th>executable
<tr><td>19096<td>Dec 30  2018<td>xshmucalc_fb
<tr><td>8984<td>Dec 30  2018<td>erosion1d
</table>

<p>The other lines don’t match the pattern, so they don’t enter into the
result.</p>
<p>How about files that have an Emacs backup file, the thing with the
version number between <code>~</code> marks?</p>
<pre><code>$_ $_ $_ $_ $size1:\d+ $date1:.* ${fname}.~$v~
&amp;$_ $_ $_ $_ $size2:\d+ $date1:.* $fname
</code></pre>
<p>This is a kind of self-join, joining the set of records with itself,
but using two different patterns.  They might both match the same line
in different ways, but they each need to match some line for the query
as a whole to succeed.  Those lines may not be consecutive — in the
above data they are not.</p>
<h2>Inference rules or views</h2>
<p>A better way to formulate that query is through a <em>view</em>, or inference
rule.  Here’s an inference rule that factors out the common part of
the above; it consists of a query, followed by one or more templates
that transform the query results into inferred lines:</p>
<pre><code>$_ $_ $_ $_ $size:\d+ $date:.* $fname
.: File $fname is $size bytes, modified $date.
</code></pre>
<p>This inference rule causes a panoply of inferred lines to implicitly
spring into existence:</p>
<pre><code>File erosion1d.c.~1~ is 254 bytes, modified Dec 30  2018.
File erosion1d is 8984 bytes, modified Dec 30  2018.
File erosion1d-log.c.~1~ is 534 bytes, modified Dec 30  2018.
File erosion1d.c is 1122 bytes, modified Dec 30  2018.
</code></pre>
<p>And so on.  This allows us to write the self-join query from before
much more conveniently, now matching these inferred lines:</p>
<pre><code>File $fname $_:.*
&amp;File ${fname}.~$v~ $_:.*
</code></pre>
<p>Such inference rules have the potential to produce infinite loops of
inferring more and more lines:</p>
<pre><code>GNU$stuff:.*

.: GNU’s Not Unix$stuff
</code></pre>
<p>In general I think it is undecidable whether this is happening, so
probably the best solution is to ensure that if it happens, it doesn’t
lead to disasters.</p>
<h2>JSON?</h2>
<p>This is messy, like the Unix shell utilities that inspired
it — concatenating raw strings and then trying to parse the results is
a recipe for disaster — so maybe inferring JSON and using
destructuring matches like modern JS would be better than inferring
text lines; then we only need to use text matching when it’s part of
the problem statement:</p>
<pre><code>$_ $_ $_ $_ $size:\d+ $date:.* $fname
.: {fname, size, date}

{fname}
&amp;{fname: "${fname}.~$v~"}
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>{fname}</code> is syntactic sugar for <code>{"fname": "$fname"}</code>, and
similarly for <code>{fname, size, date}</code>.</p>
<h2>Grouping</h2>
<p>Suppose you specify an aggregate operation on a field:</p>
<pre><code>$perm   1 user user $size.sum:\d+ $_:.*
</code></pre>
<p>Aggregation implies that you need to do some kind of grouping in order
to have groups to run the aggregation over.  How do you do the
grouping?  Well, in SQL, if you use grouping, the only fields you can
legally SELECT without an aggregate operation are the ones you’re
going to GROUP BY.  (MySQL is historically lax about this.)  So
implicitly we could just use the fields that don’t have an aggregate
operation attached to them, so the above will group by permissions!</p>
<pre><code>      perm    count size.sum
---------- -------- --------
-rw-r--r--        5    43327
-rwxr-xr-x        2    28080
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple aggregations on the same field don’t fit easily into this
approach, but they are rare.</p>
<p>A useful aggregation that makes sense in this context is <code>.join(sep)</code>.</p>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>By default aggregation results should be sorted descending, but by
which field?  You should be able to tag a field in your query as the
sort key; consider this data from <code>ps ux</code>:</p>
<pre><code>user     28358  0.7  7.8 2114240 310916 ?      Sl   Aug22  59:20 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox -contentproc -childID 
user     28905  0.0  1.2 122440 49028 pts/2    S    00:49   0:04 xpdf.real sensors-18-00768.pdf
user     29260  0.0  0.0  22460  3516 pts/4    Ss+  Aug26   0:00 bash
user     29299  0.0  0.0   8340  1892 pts/4    T    Aug26   0:00 less sensors-18-00768.pdf
</code></pre>
<p>You could match it with:</p>
<pre><code>$uid $pid $_:.* $vsz:\d+ $rss:\d+ $tty $stat $start $cpu $cmd:.*
</code></pre>
<p>But maybe you’d like to sort by RSS:</p>
<pre><code>$uid $pid $_:.* $vsz:\d+ $rss+:\d+ $tty $stat $start $cpu $cmd:.*
</code></pre>
<p>Or sort ascending instead:</p>
<pre><code>$uid $pid $_:.* $vsz:\d+ $rss-:\d+ $tty $stat $start $cpu $cmd:.*
</code></pre>
<p>Of course more sophisticated sorting requires multi-field keys,
specifying numeric versus ASCIIbetical versus locale versus
mixed-text-and-numbers, field ordering in the key, and so on.  But the
simple case should be easy.</p>
<h2>Non-equality criteria</h2>
<p>The above allows you to select lines where a field is equal to a
constant or to some concatenation that includes some other field
value.  So you can find your zero-byte files.  But what if you want to
find your files that are over a mebibyte?  You need to be able to say
something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$perm   $nlinks user user $size[&gt;1048576] $_:.* $name
</code></pre>
<h2>Line sequences</h2>
<p>Most text files aren’t purely unordered bags, and if you can grok a
bit of their structure, you can do much more useful things.  There’s a
whole ladder of language power to ascend here — first strict sequences
of line templates:</p>
<pre><code>commit $commit
Author: $author:.*
Date:   $date:.*
</code></pre>
<p>Then some kind of vague contextual line-template thing for simple
hierarchical structures with header lines at the top, where each
occurrence of the <em>last</em> line in the template creates a row, but
implicitly pulls in all the fields from the most recent occurrence of
each of the others:</p>
<pre><code>* $h1:.*
...
** $h2:.*
...
*** $h3:.*
...
${_:.*}&lt;${url}&gt;$_:.*
</code></pre>
<p>This would be especially useful for things like <code>ls -lR</code> output:</p>
<pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1060956 Dec  2  2018 e0000ea7.au
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1060956 Dec  2  2018 e0000ffe.au

./whatsapp-mockup:
total 104
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  1192 Oct 23  2016 camera.png
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user   591 Oct 23  2016 check.png
</code></pre>
<p>Here you want to use a pattern something like this, so that you can
know what directory each file is in:</p>
<pre><code>${dir}:
total $dirtotal
...
$perm   $nlinks $user $group $size $date:.* $filename
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could tag some kind of thing onto the end of the
line pattern that asks for the <em>most recent</em> matching line, without
implying a hierarchical structure.</p>
<p>Then some kind of regular expression system for line templates, then a
full grammar system (which is getting into <a href="../notes/tagging-parser.html">Tagging parsers</a>),
which could also extend down into the lines themselves, so that you
can do things like parse the ingredients out of “Neapolitan ($17):
Ham, tomato, garlic, and mozzarella”.  The only trouble with that is
that an AST isn’t very similar to an N-ary relation.</p>
<h2>Web scraping</h2>
<p>Probably the largest current source of structured data that needs to
be parsed out of big text files, and for which regexps are currently
the best choice.</p>
<h2>Data entry</h2>
<p>If you were writing a file to be parsed by such a query system, you
could imagine a text editor that would make it very easy by offering
syntax highlighting and contextual autocomplete — maybe any word that
was the same as in the line above it would be grayed out, and TAB at
the end of a line that was shorter than the previous line would copy
down whatever text was the same on those two lines.  So for example at
the end of this:</p>
<pre><code>Barbara is Joanie’s mother.
Joanie is Ryan’s mother.
Ryan
</code></pre>
<p>TAB would insert a grayed-out “is”, taking you to the next “field”, at
which point an autocomplete dropdown combo box thing would suggest
that you might want “Joanie” or “Ryan”.  (Maybe it could guess that
the two data columns were the same type and suggest “Barbara” too.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
