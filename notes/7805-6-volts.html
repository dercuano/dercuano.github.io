<p>Lots of discarded electronics has things like 7805s and white LEDs in
it.  White LEDs need about 3 volts to light, and the bright
illumination ones have a substantially less exponential V–I curve than
ordinary indicator LEDs (because of a larger ohmic resistance
component and special magic I don’t understand to prevent thermal
runaway) so it’s typical to hook two of them in series up to a 6-volt
power supply.  But they’re not <em>so</em> ohmic that it’s a good idea to
hook them up to, say, a 9-volt or 12-volt supply, or that they’ll work
on a 5-volt supply.  (8 volts — 4 volts per LED — does seem to work
with the 6-volt lighting panels I picked up off the sidewalk.  At
12 volts — 6 volts per LED — my 12-volt 500-mA switching power supply
detects an overload and turns off before burning out any LEDs.)</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a 7806 6-volt voltage regulator, but it’s much less common
than the 7805 and the 7812.  But it’s not actually that hard to get a
regulated 6 volts out of a 7805.</p>
<h2>The 7805</h2>
<p>The 7805 is a three-pin regulator which reduces, according to
Fairchild’s datasheet, 7–35 Vdc to 5 Vdc ±4% at up to 1 A (1.5 A from
TI) as long as it’s below 125° (150° from TI), with 5°/W of thermal
resistance from the junction to the case (3°/W from TI), and so with
adequate heatsinking it can dissipate 20 watts or more.  It regulates
its output pin to 5 V above its ground pin, which sources up to 8 mA.
Bypassing with 0.33μF on input and 0.1μF on output is suggested but
not generally needed.</p>
<h2>The hack</h2>
<p>The idea is that you float the 7805’s “ground” pin 1 V above the real
ground, using a 5:1 voltage divider.  This is shown on p. 23 of
Fairchild’s datasheet.  If we’re satisfied for the 8 mA regulator
current through the voltage divider to produce an error of 0.2 V,
which is comparable to the 4% error of the regulator itself, the
divider circuit needs to be fairly low resistance: 25 Ω down to real
ground and 125 Ω up to the output pin.  The 125-Ω resistor will be
dissipating 200 mW, so you need to use at least a ¼-watt resistor.
(Alternatively, you can use an op-amp buffer to set the “ground”
voltage for lower power consumption and error, as shown on p. 24.)</p>
<p>In this case, though, you could probably tolerate a larger error and
use, say, a 100-Ω resistor and a 330-Ω resistor.  15 mA through the
330-Ω resistor plus 4–8 mA of bias current through the ground pin put
19–23 mA and thus 1.9–2.3 V of offset on the 100-Ω resistor, giving
6.9–7.3 V on the output, or 6.7–7.5 V if we include the 7805’s own
error too.</p>
<h2>Power dissipation</h2>
<p>If 500 mA (a guess) is running through the 6-volt LED strings, they’ll
be dissipating 3 watts, which is not a big problem since they’re
spread out over a large area.  If the 7805 is dropping 12 volts (-1)
down to 5 volts, it will also be dissipating 3 watts.  Though it’s
specced to operate at 125°, I’d kind of want to keep it below 70° so
it will last longer and I’m not at risk of burning my hand on it, and
in environmental temperatures up to 35° here in Buenos Aires, that
only leaves ΔT = 35°, so we only have a thermal resistance budget of
11.7°/W, of which the junction-to-case resistance already eats up
5°/W.  So we need 6.7°/W or less between the heatsink and its coupling
to the TO-220 case.</p>
<p>The heatsink tab is, for better or for worse, connected to the
package’s ground pin, since that’s the most negative voltage in the
circuit.</p>
<h2>In 2019, you should probably just use PWM for multi-watt loads, though</h2>
<p>A transistor switch (maybe controlled with a second transistor), a
small inductor and a small capacitor for an LC filter, a
microcontroller, and possibly a resistor or two for analog feedback
from the output is a better solution.  You can totally run the
microcontroller off your 7805, and you get 95+% efficiency (instead of
the 50% described here).  The ±4% precision of the 7805 may or may not
be available from a microcontroller without trimming, but it’s plenty
good enough for this.  For example, the ATMega328P datasheet specifies
its internal bandgap voltage reference as 1 V ±10%, and its ADC
contributes about an additional ±1% error; the STM32F103xx is
specified to be better with only ±3% error on its reference and ±0.3%
ADC error.</p>
<p>Additionally, this gives you programmability and dimming up to a few
hundred kHz for free.  The dimming is only voltage dimming, and so
highly nonlinear for LED illumination.</p>
<p>The downside of this is that you lose the overheating,
current-limiting, and foldback protections built into the “virtually
indestructible” 7805.</p>
<p>LEDs can general tolerate higher pulsed power than constant power, so
the LC filter might seem unnecessary.  But if you’re running off a
12-volt or 19-volt DC supply, I’m not confident that even short
current pulses through the LEDs won’t destroy the LEDs or the
switching transistor, and of course the shortness of the pulses is a
function of the microcontroller software.</p>
<h3>Power dissipated by PWM</h3>
<p>If you’re dimming at 200 kHz via a IRLML6402 (a 40¢ P-channel power
MOSFET rated for 20 V and 3.7 A; see <a href="../notes/jellybeans.html">My attempt to learn about jellybean electronic components</a>), you’re
dumping 12 nC from its gate to ground every time you turn it on; that
might be about 12 volts.  That’s 2.4 mA of gate switching losses at
12 V: 30 mW, about 100× less than the linear 7805.  Its 65 mΩ
on-resistance will dissipate another 16 mW at 500 mA.  So you don’t
gain much from using a substantially lower frequency like 20 kHz,
right?</p>
<p>No, wait — the datasheet also lists a 48 ns rise time and a 381 ns
fall time, so each 5-μs-period pulse includes an 0.43-μs transition
time during which the on-resistance is significant.  If we simplify
its behavior to a linear ramp up of current from 0 to 500 mA during
that time, while its drain–source voltage linearly drops from 12 V to
0, its linear power consumption follows a parabola from 0 to 0 during
that time, with a peak at 1.5 W in the middle.  So it might also have
some 90 mW or so of switching losses just from being slow.  (Its real
behavior is somewhat more complex, but that toy model is probably
adequate for our purposes here.)</p>
<p>So, although power consumption is acceptable at around 125 mW, you
actually might improve it substantially by dropping to 100 kHz or
50 kHz or something, or using a beefier MOSFET.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
