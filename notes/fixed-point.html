(1 minute)</div><p>Fixed-point math is a case where you'd really benefit a lot from a
rich type system.  Instead of "This is an integer," or "This is a
floating-point number," you'd like to be able to say, "This is a
32-bit fixed-point number with 2 decimal digits of fraction," or
perhaps more commonly, "This is a 16-bit fixed-point number with 8
bits of fraction".  This allows you to do something like
floating-point math, but with all the manipulation of the exponent
done at compile time, leaving only mantissas to run-time.  Especially
for addition, subtraction, and comparisons, this is a huge savings on
processors without floating-point hardware, such a huge savings that
it's often worth it to do it by hand, without compiler support.</p>
<p>Type systems like C's can't cope with types like that.  C++'s template
system can do surprising things sometimes, but I don't think it can do
it either.  But you could certainly imagine a language whose type
system was rich enough to let you do it.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
