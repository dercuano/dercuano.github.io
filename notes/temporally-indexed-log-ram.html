<p>The Mill CPU uses a randomly-readable queue,
called the “belt”,
instead of stacks or
registers; the last <em>n</em> instruction outputs (I think <em>n</em> = 16?) are
addressable as inputs.  This makes the instruction set encoding
denser, due to the lack of need for output register fields in the
instructions.  It also makes superscalar scheduling simpler, because
inter-instruction dependencies are simpler to detect.</p>
<p>Normal RAM is made of registers; imperative programming languages
expose this in the language semantics, indeed centering it.  A
register is a function from time to values, computed from a sequence
of writes at different times; at any time <em>t</em> its value is the value
written by the last write at time before <em>t</em>.  What if, instead of a
RAM made of registers, we had a RAM made of belts, each storing the
entire sequence of writes to that location?  Indeed, what if it were
made of infinite belts?</p>
<h2>Similar language features</h2>
<p>I was debugging some Octave† code today.  In Octave, an assignment
statement like <code>x = y + z</code> generates a line of output by default
saying something like <code>x = 5.4405</code>.  To suppress this, you have to
append a semicolon, which is only legal on assignment statements.  So
if you write a piece of Octave code without any semicolons and then
run it, it outputs a history of all the values assumed by variables
during its execution, interleaved by time, a trace which is very
valuable when debugging.  If only one variable is thus semicolonless,
the trace shows the history of its values.  By examining the overall
behavior of the trace, you can often understand things about your
program’s behavior that are difficult to see from its state at a
single point in time.</p>
<p>Of course you can do something analogous in almost any programming
language with <code>print</code> statements, and this “printf debugging” or
“logging” is a common tactic, superior to stepping in a debugger under
many circumstances; my friend Charity is doing a very influential
startup right now
called honeycomb.io
based on elaborations of printf debugging.  But in
Octave, logging every new value assumed by every variable is a
default.  You have to turn it off explicitly.  (Unfortunately, you do
that by editing the code.)</p>
<p>Another thing I’ve wanted to do frequently with Octave when writing
numerical algorithms that compute a series of <em>xᵢ</em> values is to change
the code between returning a vector <em>x</em> of all the values or just
returning the last value <em>xₙ</em>.  Typically one direction of this
transformation amounts to replacing <code>x =</code> with <code>x(end+1) =</code>, and <code>x</code>
otherwise with <code>x(end)</code>.</p>
<p>The DDD debugger frontend to the GDB debugger also has facilities to
capture values of specified variables every time a given breakpoint is
hit; then you can plot or list the logged values.</p>
<p>Bret Victor has done a couple of experimental programming environment
sketches which log each new value produced and annotate your source
code with them, placing time on the horizontal axis — one aimed at
defining and exploring recurrence relations, another intended to make
imperative looping more understandable to new programmers.</p>
<p>Python and ES6 have a “generator” feature in which you can define
lazily-computed sequences of values by writing an imperative function
to <code>yield</code> them one by one; for example:</p>
<pre><code>def lc_words(fileobj):
    for line in fileobj:
        for word in line.split():
            yield word.lower()

def pairs(seq):
    last = next(seq)
    for item in seq:
        yield last, item
        last = item
</code></pre>
<p>† Octave is a free-software clone of MATLAB.</p>
<h2>A language with nondestructive assignment statements</h2>
<p>What if assignment statements like <code>x = 3</code> still changed the value of
<code>x</code>, but left its previous values accessible, say, as <code>x@1</code>, <code>x@2</code>,
and so on?  Then you could inspect all the previous values when you
were trying to debug a program.  Moreover, you wouldn’t have to do
anything special to enable my iterative-calculation Octave functions
to return their whole list of values — though if the number of
iterations wasn’t known ahead of time, they’d have to return the
length of the list, too.</p>
<p>Many DSP algorithms would become slightly simpler to write, since you
could just write <code>x</code> when you wanted the latest value of <em>x</em>, and
<code>x@1</code>, <code>x@2</code>, etc., when you wanted <em>xᵢ₋₁</em>, <em>xᵢ₋₂</em>, etc.</p>
<p>The downside is that refactoring would become somewhat trickier; <code>x =
f(y); x = f(x)</code> would no longer be equivalent to <code>x = f(f(y))</code>, <code>x =
0; if (g(n)) x = n</code> would no longer be equivalent to <code>x = g(n) ? n :
0</code>, and functions would expose the entire value history of their
return value, not just its final value, even if only the final value
was intended to be used.</p>
<p>As described in <a href="../notes/scicalc-usability.html">Usability of scientific calculators</a>, writing down numerical state
machines in such a notation is very convenient.</p>
<p>It might be worthwhile to provide an <code>#x</code> operation to tell you the
total number of values that have been written to <em>x</em> so far.  This
would allow you to note <code>#x</code>, call some function that appends things
to <em>x</em>, and then subtract from the new <code>#x</code> when its execution
finishes to see how many values it produced.  I think this is probably
pretty bug-prone, though, since it tempts you to write code that
assumes that nothing has ever written to <em>x</em> previously, and puts you
in danger of writing code that will break if <code>#x</code> has some unexpected
value.  Maybe if <code>#x</code> starts at 1'000'000 or something, that would
ameliorate this problem. (Alternatively, you could set <code>#x</code> to 0 in
the language model for local variables <code>x</code>.)</p>
<p>In the framework of <em>Essentials of Programming Languages</em>, the
<em>expressed values</em> of the language, those that expressions can
evaluate to, would still be atomic values like numbers and characters,
but its <em>denoted values</em> would be integer-indexed limitless logs of
such atomic values.</p>
<p>There’s no way for a subroutine in such a language to reduce its
memory consumption; all previously produced values are available for
inspection.  So it probably needs to be short-lived.</p>
<h2>Could we get by without any other kind of indexed memory addressing?</h2>
<p>If the memory in our language’s virtual machine consists not of
registers but of limitless logs of past values, any single variable
can then contain an entire array, and indeed a limitless number of
arrays one after the other.</p>
<p>For the first ten or twenty years, say from 1945 to sometime between
1955 and 1965 in different lineages, the memory addresses to access
(typically “registers of the store”, at the time) were hardcoded into
the instruction.  This made it hard to write loops like this one:</p>
<pre><code>int total = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) total += x[i];
</code></pre>
<p>That’s because the different items of <code>x[i]</code> are stored at different
memory addresses, and the same addition instruction has to access all
of them.  So you had to modify the instruction.  Typically you would
add the index to it, since the source address field was typically
stored in the least significant bits of the instruction, though this
could obviously cause surprising effects if the arithmetic generated
carries out of that field.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem was the “index register”, and later also
“base registers” and “pointer registers”, which are just CPU registers
whose values enter into the computation of the effective address.
This allows you to compile code like the above without generating
self-modifying code — you just store <code>i</code> in an index register, or
maybe even <code>&amp;x[0]</code> if the index register is wide enough.  (C goes
further and declares array indexing to be merely a matter of pointer
arithmetic.)</p>
<p>Could we replace array and structure indexing entirely with this kind
of indexing into the past?  Maybe our instruction set could disallow
indexing space and only allow indexing time.</p>
<p>It turns out that you can, and it doesn’t really cost you performance
except in the case of random indexed writes, for which it costs you a
logarithmic slowdown.  Programs are arguably slightly clearer than the
same programs written using index registers, but not as clear as
programs written using indexing and field access in modern programming
languages.</p>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p>Well, if the memory consists not of registers but of infinite logs of
past values, a single variable <code>x</code> can then contain the entire array:</p>
<pre><code>int total = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) total += x@i;
</code></pre>
<p>This has the potential disadvantage that, as in core LISP, reading
happens in the opposite order from writing.  For this case it doesn’t
matter, but when it does, you can write <code>x@(n-i)</code>, for Octave-style
1-based indexing, or <code>x@(n-i+1)</code> for C-style 0-based indexing.</p>
<p>If <code>n</code> is a constant, you can access item <em>i</em> of the <em>j</em>th previous
value of <em>x</em> with <code>x@(n*j - i + 1)</code>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the past values of <code>n</code> are the lengths of past
arrays stored in <code>x</code>, then we can index the <em>j</em>th of them with <em>O(j)</em>
work; the length of the previous <code>x</code> array is <code>n@1</code>, and its latest
value is <code>x@n</code>.  The one before that ends at <code>x@(n+n←1)</code> and is of
length <code>n@2</code>, the one before that is <code>x@(n+n@1+n@2)</code> and is of length
<code>n@3</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>If we want random access to the past <code>x</code> arrays, we can store the
prefix sum of their lengths instead of just the lengths themselves.
If the prefix sums are stored in <code>s</code>, then the length of the latest
<code>x</code> array is <code>s-s@1</code>, the previous one is <code>s@1-s@2</code>, and the one
before that is <code>s@2-s@3</code> (and its last element is <code>x@(s-s@2)</code>).</p>
<p>This storage scheme sort of prevents you from appending elements
incrementally to the latest <code>x</code> array, which is maybe undesirable; in
that case you can store its length in a variable <code>n</code> that you can
increment, and only store the cumulative sum of the <em>completed</em> array
lengths in <code>s</code>.  So then you have <code>n+s-s@(j-1)</code> elements after the end
of the <em>j</em>th-from-last array, for <em>j</em> &gt; 0.</p>
<p>If no typing discipline prevents it, you could get by with writing the
lengths and their cumulative sums and whatnot to the same variable as
the array values themselves, but that gets awkward to program.</p>
<p>These schemes generalize with little difficulty to multidimensional
arrays; if you want to regard the <em>n</em> last items of <em>x</em> as a
two-dimensional <em>w</em>×<em>h</em> array, such as a grayscale image, you can
index item (<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>) as, for example, <code>x@(w*i + j)</code>.</p>
<h3>Statically-typed immutable heap records</h3>
<p>Consider structures less regular than arrays, though — binary search
trees, for example.  You might have a single type of tree node with a
key field and nullable left and right pointers.  You can store this as
parallel arrays <code>K</code>, <code>L</code>, and <code>R</code>, and a count <code>n</code>.  (Parallel arrays
really suck if you’re deleting objects, but fortunately that’s
something we don’t have to worry about here.)  <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> can be
integer indices.  You can’t mutate anything, but you can add new
nodes, which is enough to allow you to create a new updated root for a
new tree state.</p>
<p>Here’s a binary tree search using this representation:</p>
<pre><code>next = root
while next != 0:
    node = next
    if needle == K@(n - node): break
    next = (needle &lt; K@(n - node)) ? L@(n - node) : R@(n - node)
</code></pre>
<p>Generally, though, when we have a bunch of records floating around in
the heap with links to each other, we have multiple different types of
records (classes of windows, productions of syntax, etc.), so we want
dynamic typing.  Dynamic typing is a bit hairier.  Let’s call the
structure formed by <code>K</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>R</code>, and <code>n</code> a “table”, and <code>K</code>, <code>L</code>,
and <code>R</code> its “columns”.  For a sum type, we need one table per variant
type, plus a sum-type table with a tag column (telling which table the
real value is in) and a pointer column (giving its index in that
table), or with one pointer column per variant type.  Optionally, if
there’s some data in common among all variants, you can move that data
into an extra column in the sum-type table, which gives you more or
less the conventional RDBMS approach to inheritance subtyping if you
continue it a bit further.</p>
<p>(Syntactic sugar for this "table" construct might be necessary to make
this approach actually usable.)</p>
<h3>Random writing to arrays</h3>
<p>We’ve talked about reading from random indexes into arrays.  But what
about algorithms that want not to <em>read</em> at random indexes but to
<em>write</em> at them?  For example, suppose we want to draw a diagonal
Bresenham line on the <code>x@(w*i + j)</code> grayscale image mentioned just
above.  There’s no direct way to do this; we can only write to the end
of <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>You could, though, stick all your lines and other graphical primitives
in a buffer and use the scanline rendering rasterization algorithm to
compute the scan lines of the image in order.  This is potentially
more difficult for hairier primitives like splines and IFS fractals.</p>
<p>However, we can totally construct a sparse matrix in COO format — a
table with columns <code>row</code>, <code>column</code>, and <code>value</code>.  You can append onto
these things in whatever order you like.  Converting a COO sparse
matrix to a dense matrix is conventionally done in linear time with
random writes, but you can also do it by sorting the items and then
traversing the sorted list.  This adds a logarithmic slowdown, but
perhaps with a well-tuned sort, that would be tolerable.</p>
<p>(Technically radix sorts are linear-time in input size because your
number of distinct sort keys can’t approach infinity without their
length also approaching infinity, but in the approximation where we
have less than, say, 2⁶⁴ different sort keys, their execution time is
more nearly linearithmic, like comparison-based algorithms.)</p>
<h2>Implementations in hardware or software</h2>
<p>Programs written in this bizarre fashion have the pleasant feature
that their memory writes are in some sense sequential, which — aside
from whatever debugging benefits it may or may not provide — works
well with WORM media (which are not very important at the moment, but
may be in the future) and block-erased NAND Flash.</p>
<p>However, it’s not really plausible that future computers will be
without at least a few kilobytes of traditional register-style RAM,
writing to which will be much cheaper than writing to WORM or Flash.
So pushing the sequentiality of writing down to the atomic program
operation level may not make sense.  Also, if you want to keep the
writes actually sequential in real life, you can’t use a separate
memory for each variable; you need some system that dynamically
apportions blocks of data written to the sequential medium among the
variables that are actually being written to, and adds enough indexing
that you can index far into those variables’ past quickly, without
using up too much space.</p>
<p>Binary instructions (whether executed by software or in hardware)
accessing a memory made of belts could use a smaller number of bits to
select a belt in RAM than normal instructions use to select a byte or
word in it.</p>
<p>If you’re implementing this model in software on today’s hardware,
with its supercharged multilevel SRAM caches and gigabytes of SDRAM,
you probably should store the current value of each variable in a
fixed memory location, allocating a page or so of buffer to log its
previous values into; you may be able to take advantage of page
faults, Electric-Fence-style, for overflow detection, and thus avoid
the overhead of bounds-checking instructions on every write (at the
expense of TLB pollution).</p>
<h2>Garbage collection</h2>
<p>Generally, as I said, garbage collection is impossible, but there may
be cases where some memory can be reclaimed.</p>
<p>First, of course, if variables are local to a subroutine, they can be
freed when the subroutine returns.</p>
<p>The following presumes that there’s no Fortran-style array aliasing
going on when we pass parameters to subroutines; otherwise, the
problem becomes quite a bit hairier.</p>
<p>Some variables may never be indexed at all; if their previous values
are saved at all, it’s only for debugging purposes.  Some variables
may only be indexed by constants, for example, in DSP code, so their
previous values can be saved in a small circular buffer.</p>
<p>Bounds on variable index expressions are more difficult.  It may be
deducible that a variable <em>i</em> is always in the range [0, <em>n</em>), or is
never negative; this would allow us to deduce that <code>x@(n-i)</code> can never
index further back than <em>n</em>.  But for this to allow us to discard
values of <em>x</em> older than <em>n</em>, we need to also be able to show that <em>n</em>
cannot increase, or at least cannot increase any faster than <em>x</em> is
extended.</p>
<p>Instead of rigorously proving such bounds correct, you could try using
relatively conservative allocation sizes for different variables, and
restarting the program from a checkpoint if it suffers a bounds
violation, indicating that it was trying to access values that it had
already forgotten.  For code that generates the forgotten values in
linear time — that is to say, at an asymptotically constant speed,
rather than one that increases without bound — doing this with a
multiplicative increase in the space for the bounds-violated variable
is “only a constant factor” slowdown.  But it’s a constant factor
that’s a multiple of the number of such variables, if you just
increase the size of the one.  (Generating values at a speed that
increases without bound is of course impossible; you can at most
generate one value per instruction.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, spilling memory to disk could permit your program to
generate a terabyte or more of past values before any must be
discarded.</p>
<p>You could imagine some class of programs might be easier to
automatically parallelize or strength-reduce in this memory model,
since in a way what it supports natively are simple recurrence
relations like those discussed in <a href="../notes/dynamical-systems.html">Notations for defining dynamical systems</a>.  The idea
is that you write your program as an initial state and a reduction
function that updates the initial state, either according to an input
datum or on its own; then the compiler turns some or all of the
program into elementwise operations and parallel prefix-sums using
some subset of the program it’s proven associative so that the
parallel prefix-sum algorithm applies.  Thus the different reductions
aren't really running sequentially.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
