(19 minutes)</div><p>I just bought a scientific calculator (for US$27) with the purpose of
cannibalizing its solar cell (it can also run off a button cell) and
maybe display and keyboard.  But I got distracted with its user
interface, which is kind of amazing given the constraints it’s under.</p>
<p>First, I want to be clear that the calculator is unfortunately rather
limited in its power, and there are a lot of things that are clumsy
about its user interface.  And I’ve crashed into quite a number of
usability problems.  Despite all this, it does achieve many amazing
things.</p>
<p>This is a Cifra SC-9100 sold by Unitronic SA here in Argentina, but
likely they didn’t design the hardware or write the software, both of
which are probably from a white-label company in China, where the
calculator is made.  In part I base this inference on the fact that
the error messages are in English.</p>
<p>It has a large 5×4 keypad for the most basic functionality
(arithmetic, entering numbers, clearing), a 6×4 area above it with two
keys missing for most of the functions, and four navigational/shift
and four directional keys, for a total of 50 keys.</p>
<p>This calculator is not comparable to the TI-83 or HP-48 lines of
graphing calculators with computer algebra systems onboard.  But then,
they can’t run off a tiny solar cell, either.  Evidence suggests that
it has on the order of 2K of memory.</p>
<h2>Feature list</h2>
<p>To some extent this calculator seems to have been designed to fill out
a feature checklist, because many of the features don’t work together
properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>79-step infix algebraic expression evaluation with 9 variables with
  letter names.</li>
<li>Interactive editing of expressions before evaluating them on a
  12-character alphanumeric line with 5×6 pixels per glyph.</li>
<li>When you have a syntax error, you can jump the cursor to it.</li>
<li>Stored history of the last few (6–8 usually) calculations and
  results.</li>
<li>A direction pad on the keyboard, which makes the history editing
  pretty easy.</li>
<li>Decimal floating-point, d°m's", complex, and rational numeric types.</li>
<li>The usual complement of standard numerical functions: square root,
  cube root, square, cube, exponent, nth root, log, 10ⁿ, ln, eⁿ, sin,
  cos, tan, sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹, sinh, cosh, tanh, sinh⁻¹, cosh⁻¹,
  tanh⁻¹, nPr, nCr, +, -, ×, ÷, factorial, reciprocal, polar to
  rectangular, and rectangular to polar.</li>
<li>Newton’s-method-based solver for (single) arbitrary general
  equations; you can supply values for some of the variables and ask
  it to solve for another one, although this may not always converge.</li>
<li>Special solvers for quadratic and cubic equations in one variable
  and for systems of linear equations in 3 or 4 unknowns.</li>
<li>A sort of forms-based user interface for the solvers where you can
  navigate around the fields.</li>
<li>Display modes including fixed-point, scientific notation,
  engineering notation, which can be selected after the fact and then
  used to review previous results.</li>
<li>A very easy but limited programming facility reminiscent of BASIC
  without control structures.</li>
<li>Twenty predetermined unit conversions and their inverses, including
  things like horsepower, acres, mmHg (but not psi!), and parsecs (but
  not lightyears).</li>
<li>40 physical constants, including things like the Stefan-Boltzmann
  constant and the permittivity of free space.</li>
<li>Hexadecimal, octal, and binary bases and bitwise operations.</li>
<li>Statistics: mean, standard deviation, and regressions (linear,
  logarithmic, exponential, power, inverse (reciprocal), and
  quadratic).</li>
<li>Numerical integration using Simpson’s rule; approximation of
  numerical differentiation using finite differencing.</li>
<li>Matrices, but only up to 3×3.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limited BASIC-like programming facility</h2>
<p>Here’s a version of Minsky’s circle program in a 3-place fixed-point
display mode.</p>
<p>I type 1 SHIFT STO X to set X to 1; this results in the display</p>
<pre><code>1→X
    1.000
</code></pre>
<p>Then 0 SHIFT STO Y:</p>
<pre><code>0→Y
    0.000
</code></pre>
<p>Now I enter the program:</p>
<pre><code>X=X-.1Y:Y=Y+.1X:X²+Y²
</code></pre>
<p>And I press the = key (the other = key) repeatedly to single-step the
program as an endless loop:</p>
<pre><code>X=X-.1Y
    1.000
Y=Y+.1X
    0.100
X²+Y²
    1.010
X=X-.1Y
    0.990
Y=Y+.1X
    0.199
X²+Y²
    1.020
X=X-.1Y
    0.970
Y=Y+.1X
    0.296
X²+Y²
    1.029
X=X-.1Y
    0.940
Y=Y+.1X
    0.390
X²+Y²
    1.037
</code></pre>
<p>Continuing in this vein, after 11 more iterations (33 presses of the =
key) we get to X = 0.020, Y = 1.001, X²+Y² = 1.002.  (The third
expression is just a kind of a sanity check.)</p>
<p>To me, this is an incredible kind of immediacy: in 8 keystrokes I can
set up the initial state of the program, in 33 more keystrokes I can
implement Minsky’s circle algorithm with a debugging statement, and
then I can immediately start single-stepping it.  A further additional
keystroke — the left or right direction on the direction pad — takes
me back into editing the program.</p>
<p>You can similarly easily program it to, for example, tabulate the
values of a function:</p>
<pre><code>0→X
X(1-X):X=X+.1
</code></pre>
<p>This gives us the sequence 0.000, 0.090, 0.160, 0.210, 0.240, 0.250,
0.240, 0.210, 0.160, 0.090, 0.000 (-0.110, ...) just as it should,
with two keystrokes per output number.  Or, to tabulate the logit at
intervals of 0.05:</p>
<pre><code>.05→X
ln (X÷(1-X:X=X+.05
</code></pre>
<p>(Note the unterminated parentheses before the <code>:</code>.  Also note that
<code>ln</code> was one keystroke.)  In 27 keystrokes, plus two per answer, this
gives -2.944, -2.197, -1.735, -1.386, -1.099, -0.847, -0.619, -0.405,
-0.201, 0, and so on, with two keystrokes per output number.  This
agrees with the results of <code>scipy.special.logit(numpy.linspace(0.05,
0.95, 19))</code>.</p>
<p>Excel’s user interface is probably the most optimized for doing such
iterative numerical calculations in the history of the universe.
Doing the same version of Minsky’s algorithm in Gnumeric, which uses
Excel’s user interface, is <code>1 TAB 0 ↵ =↑-.1*→ TAB =↑+.1*↓← TAB =←
SHIFT ^ 2 + ← SHIFT ^ 2 ↵ ↑ SHIFT ←← ^C↓←← SHIFT PgDn ^V</code>, which is 45
keystrokes as I count it — almost 50% more!  (And that’s not even
charging extra for the fact that my netbook doesn’t have a keypad, so
even some basic arithmetic operators need shift.)</p>
<p>Of course, Gnumeric (or Excel) doesn’t require three more keystrokes
to get each new answer, doesn’t forget the previous results, can
automatically recalculate, can graph, and so on.  And in my Gnumeric
instance, that <code>SHIFT PgDn ^V</code> at the end pasted 16 iterations, which
would be 48 keystrokes on the calculator.</p>
<p>But I feel that these issues of the accessibility, manipulability, and
inspectability of the state machine’s execution history are nearly
orthogonal to the issues of specifying the state machine’s transition
function.  Yes, the two sets of functionality do compete for the same
keyboard keys.  But specifying the same state machine took 33
keystrokes on 50 keys on the calculator (about 186 bits), and about 45
keystrokes on 82 keys on my netbook (about 286 bits).</p>
<p>The good news kind of ends here, though.  As far as I can tell, there
are no conditionals, no way to loop without manually single-stepping,
no way to assign to multiple variables in a step, no way to store a
vector in a variable, no way to (programmatically) access previous
values of a variable, and no way to loop implicitly rather than
explicitly.  Worse, your program is lost if you press ↑ or ↓ on the
direction pad (although you can access single steps of it, the
colon-separated form is gone, and you have no copy and paste to
reconstruct it with), if the calculator automatically powers off
from inactivity, or if you start entering another expression.</p>
<p>It has a random number generator, but with only three digits, and I
haven’t found a way yet to round or truncate to an integer in a
formula.  (There is a Rnd key for rounding, but what it does is round
the currently displayed result to the displayed precision, so to a
first approximation it appears to do nothing.  You can’t use it in a
formula.)  The closest I’ve come up with is
<code>2√(2√(2√(2√(Ran#-.5)²-.5)²-.5)²-.5)²</code>; my theory was that this would
eliminate one bit of precision each time.  However, iterating the
formula <code>2√(Ans-.5)²</code> (here Ans being the result of the previous
formula) starting from .555 gives me the orbit .11, .78, .56, .12,
.76, .52, .04, .92, .84, .68, .36, .28, .44, .12; so it’s definitely
lost some information, including after the first three iterations, but
then it enters a period-10 orbit, so it doesn’t keep losing
information.  .133 enters a different orbit.</p>
<p>The above does illustrate that you can use the command-line history
facility to supply different inputs to an iterative algorithm over
time.</p>
<p>So this level of programmability of this calculator is inspiring, but
ultimately very limiting.</p>
<h2>Newton’s-method-based solver</h2>
<p>In a way this is the most amazing part to me, because it’s close to a
general interactive constraint system.  If I enter</p>
<pre><code>Y=X^6-2X+1 [SHIFT] [SOLVE]
</code></pre>
<p>(which is a bit harder than it sounds because the "=" and each of the
occurrences of a variable requires pressing the [ALPHA] key first) it
drops me into a “form” (one line displayed at a time!) where I can
supply values for Y and X.  Immediately it asks me:</p>
<pre><code>Y?
    28.000
</code></pre>
<p>If I answer by typing 2π=, it calculates that result, invisibly stores
it in Y, and continues:</p>
<pre><code>X?
     5.000
</code></pre>
<p>I can scroll up and down between the two lines of the form with the
direction pad, but if I respond to the <code>X?</code> with a second use of
[SHIFT] [SOLVE], the display goes blank for about 6 seconds and I get
the result:</p>
<pre><code>X=
    1.418
</code></pre>
<p>(I happen to have the display mode set to 3-place fixed-point, which
isn’t quite enough for displaying the solutions of sixth-order
equations.)</p>
<p>If instead I supply the value for X, move back up to Y, and press
[SHIFT] [SOLVE], it calculates Y rather more quickly.</p>
<p>This isn’t quite modeless — I can supply the value for Y by an
algebraic expression, but not by specifying a different equation to
solve, and I can’t apply the solver to systems of equations with a <code>:</code>
separating them (that gives a syntax error).</p>
<p>A related but sort of redundant facility is its CALC key; given an
algebraic expression like</p>
<pre><code>√(X²+Y²)
</code></pre>
<p>pressing CALC will query you to update X and Y in the same way (but
mysteriously without the ability to scroll to the other fields), then
display the result of evaluating the expression.</p>
<h2>Cubic solver</h2>
<p>To solve x³ - 4x² - 5x + 2 = 0, I have a couple of different options;
I can try the Newton solver, or I can use its cubic solver.  The cubic
solver is like this:</p>
<pre><code>(MODE MODE MODE 3)
 Unknowns?   →
    2   3
(→)
←Degree?        
    2   3
(3)
 a?
(1=)
 b?
(-4=)
 c?
(-5=)
 d?
(2=)
</code></pre>
<p>(half-second delay)</p>
<pre><code>x₁=          ↓
 4.93163002
x₂=          ↕
 0.323190091
x₃=          ↑
-1.254820111
</code></pre>
<p>These answers were quickly obtained, and they are correct as far as
they are displayed, although at first I mistakenly thought they
weren’t.</p>
<p>Obtaining a result using the general solver turned out to be a little
trickier; I entered this expression:</p>
<pre><code>0=X³-4X²-5X+2
</code></pre>
<p>and used SHIFT SOLVE twice, with X initially at 0.  This ran about as
fast and got the .323 solution.  X initially at 2 also yields the same
solution; with X initially at 3, I instead get the -1.25 solution.  To
try to find the third solution if we didn’t already know it, we could
try dividing out the other solutions; by using the left-arrow on the
solution we can get back to edit the equation into</p>
<pre><code>0=(X³-4X²-5X+2)÷(X-.323190091)÷(X+1.254820111)
</code></pre>
<p>With this version — which unfortunately I couldn’t copy and paste the
numbers into — I still get a solution at "-1.254820111" if X starts
there, but now if X starts at 0, I get the 4.93 solution.</p>
<p>This is considerably more effort, but it’s applicable to equations of
any degree.  It’s not guaranteed to work, due to roundoff error, but
it will often work.</p>
<p>It turns out that the <code>0=</code> I’d stuck in there at the beginning isn’t
necessary.  This works too:</p>
<pre><code>X^6-2X+1-2π [SHIFT] [SOLVE]
</code></pre>
<p>From some starting point, it comes up with the answer X=-1.193859 or
so.  Given instead (X^6-2X+1-2π)÷(X+1.1939) and a start of X=-1, in
about three seconds, it comes up with another solution at
X=1.417685166.  If we divide that factor out too, it comes back with
an error message, “Can’t solve”, after about 45 seconds or a minute;
and indeed (upon graphing the equation elsewhere) those seem to be the
only two real roots of this polynomial.  (In a sense it should be
obvious that there are only two real roots from its form.)</p>
<h2>Numerical integration and differentiation</h2>
<p>To calculate ∫√(1-x²)dx from -1 to 1 with 512 partitions using
Simpson’s rule, I type</p>
<pre><code>∫√(1-X²),-1,1,9=
</code></pre>
<p>and wait about 13 seconds.  It yields 1.5707, which is accurate almost
as far as it goes, but that isn’t very far.  (The exact answer is π/2,
close to 1.570796.)  If instead of 9 I specify 7 (for 2⁷ = 128
partitions rather than 512) it runs in about three seconds and
produces 1.57 as the result.</p>
<p>This manages to be simultaneously counterintuitive (I never would have
guessed either the comma, the logarithmic notation for the number of
partitions, or the limit of 512 partitions), opaque (it’s no easier to
write than to read), and impressive (that the calculator can do this
at all).</p>
<p>As a crude approximation, this speed suggests that it’s running a few
hundred floating-point operations per second.</p>
<p>Numerical differentiation is faster, of course.  It uses a finite
difference, because apparently the numbskulls who implemented the
calculator’s software haven’t heard of automatic differentiation yet.
To tabulate the derivative of the logit, for example:</p>
<pre><code>.05→Y
d/dx(ln (X÷(1-X,Y,1e-9:Y=Y+.05
</code></pre>
<p>This gives 21.052, 11.111, 7.844, 6.250, 5.333, 4.762(166667), 4.395,
4.167, 4.041, 4.001, 4.040, and so on.  These are accurate to nearly
four places, which is fairly underwhelming given that I specified
using Δx=10⁻⁹.  The extra digits on the 4.762 number suggest that it’s
not actually bothering to calculate the intermediate results to more
than about five places.</p>
<h2>Base-N and logical operations</h2>
<p>In base-N mode, the trigonometric keys become hexadecimal digits, and
the reciprocal key opens a menu of bitwise operations.  This allows
you to explore mappings like <code>Ans and(Ans-1)</code> or <code>Ans xor(Ans-1)</code>,
which last generates a Sierpinski triangle in binary, one row at a
time, if you seed it with a power of 2.  Unfortunately in this mode
you apparently cannot assign to variables, not even X, Y, and M.</p>
<p>However, I did manage to get it to tabulate reflected-binary Gray code
values using two keystrokes each.  First I set M to 0 using <code>RCL M
SHIFT M-</code>, and then I entered and ran the program <code>1M+:Mxor(M÷2</code>,
getting the hexadecimal sequence 1, 3, 2, 6, 7, 5, 4, C, D, F, E, A,
B, 9, 8, 18, 19, 1B, 1A, 1E, 1F, 1D, 1C, 14, 15, 17, 16, 12, 13, 11,
10, 30, ... sequence A003188.  (The program also works in decimal mode
in base-N.)</p>
<h2>Modefulness</h2>
<p>This calculator suffers terribly from modefulness.  You can’t take
absolute values except in complex-number mode; you can’t use
trigonometric functions in base-N mode (although you can use
arithmetic) because the keys are remapped to hex digits.  You can’t
use square-root in base-N mode for no apparent reason; the key just
doesn’t do anything.  You can’t numerically integrate in complex mode.
You can’t assign to variables in base-N mode or complex mode.  And so
on.</p>
<p>Worse, in some cases the meaning of programs is dependent on the mode.
In base-N mode, any numeric constant in your program will vary
depending on base — and most give a syntax error in base 2.  Worse,
this happens when you merely try to scroll back in history to the
formula.</p>
<h2>Usability lessons</h2>
<p>Except for when asked to do significant amounts of computation or when
dealing with a key that maps to nothing, the calculator is always
instantly responsive.  Its silent keyboard, despite presumably being
rubber carbon-bottomed domes under hard keys, works reliably.  These
are big pluses.</p>
<p>Bigger still is the immediacy of most operations.  Doing base
conversion with a single keypress in base-N mode is really nice.  This
doesn’t excuse the absence of features like variable assignment in
base-N.</p>
<p>The form-based UI for off-the-shelf models (e.g. cubic equations)
really eases using them, but makes composing them difficult to
impossible.</p>
<p>Writing the transition function of a numerical finite state machine as
a series of colon-separated assignments works surprisingly, even
amazingly, well.  Being able to nest assignments and to compute and
display two or three results per keystroke (rather than just one)
would help.  Being able to run the iteration out of user control (with
conditional and iteration operations) would make an even bigger
difference.  The single-step-and-see-labeled-result one-keystroke flow
is magical, though.</p>
<p>After my initial astonishing experiences with the device, I was
starting to become attached to it and doubt my tentative plans to
rebrain it with a low-power high-performance microcontroller; my
further investigation, however, shows that it’s actually kind of an
unusable piece of shit.  Current mass-market low-power ARM
microcontrollers like Atmel’s picoPower line run at 12 milliwatts at
48 million 32-bit instructions per second, which is 250 pJ/insn; my
best estimate is that in full sun this calculator’s solar cell can
produce 29 milliwatts.</p>
<p>TI’s current Nspire line of graphing calculators run on 150MHz ARM
microcontrollers with 64MB of RAM.  But they don’t run off a solar
cell.</p>
<p>I can’t find the information on the ARM picoPower microcontrollers I
was thinking of.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
