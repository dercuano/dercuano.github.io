(1 minute)</div><p>Suppose we build up dirty bitmaps of screen areas starting from some
leaf size?</p>
<p>If we use the 8×8 pixel tile used in JPEG as our basic unit, and the
64-bit size of an amd64 register as our treenode size, then the next
level up the tree is 64×64 pixels, then 512×512.  My screen is
1920x1080 pixels, so to fill it, you need just under four such tiles
from left to right and just over two from top to bottom.</p>
<p>So to describe a screen update, you could use twelve 64-bit words to
list which parts of the screen you want to update, then another 64-bit
word for each of those up-to-768 areas of 64×64 pixels you want to
update, and then probably just pixel data for each 8×8 area.  The
worst case for small updates is 13 64-bit words of overhead plus an
entire 8×8 area (128, 192, or 256 bytes); for large updates, the 6240
bytes of 1 bits at the beginning don’t amount to much, one bit for
every 41 pixels.  (And in RAM of course you can keep those 6240 bytes
always allocated.)</p>
<p>I’m not sure how useful this is now that we’re often repainting the
whole screen every frame.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
