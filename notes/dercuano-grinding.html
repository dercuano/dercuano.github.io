(12 minutes)</div><p>Right now all the code blocks in Dercuano are rather plain: black on
gray, with one typewriter typeface in one size; I think some syntax
highlighting would make it both more <em>pleasant</em> to read and more
<em>inviting</em>.  The contrast between the colorful source listing I see as
I’m editing notes in Emacs and the dull gray listing I see in the
rendered HTML is depressing.</p>
<p>The standard way to syntax-highlight code for the WWW is to run
something like Pygments or Emacs <code>htmlfontify-buffer</code> on the server side
to generate a passel of HTML spans that refer to some stylesheet, but
in part since Dercuano doesn’t have a server side, that isn’t really
an option, for the same reason prerendering of PNGs is not an option
(see <a href="../notes/dercuano-drawings.html">Dercuano drawings</a>) — the resulting files are huge.</p>
<p>So, how can I syntax-highlight code in Dercuano?  Presumably I need to
write something in JS that can be instructed to attempt to tokenize
code blocks with the lexical syntax of various languages, perhaps even
parsing them, and apply spans and styles to them based on the results.</p>
<h2>Languages: mostly Python, SQL, and very minimalist languages</h2>
<p>First I thought it would be good to take a sampling of the
syntax-highlightable languages I’m using in Dercuano.</p>

<p>The main conclusion I can draw from this random sample of 16 notes is
that there isn’t much code in Dercuano (≈⅓), and what there is tends
toward very minimalist programming languages (Scheme, Forth, Io,
Binate) which in many cases don’t even have existing
implementations — and, also, Python and SQL.  Languages I’ve recently
used in other notes include SQL, Python, OCaml, Lisp S-expressions,
Lua, GNU MathProg, and Golang.</p>
<h2>Syntactic categories and aesthetic treatment</h2>
<p>Popular syntactic categories to highlight include, in more or less
decreasing order of importance, keywords, function names, type names,
string contents, numbers, comments, and punctuation.</p>
<p>Common practice is <strong>to</strong> emphasize <strong>the</strong> keywords, <strong>but</strong> that
does <strong>not</strong> make any sense; <strong>the</strong> keywords are <strong>the</strong>
lowest-information-density part <strong>of the</strong> program code, so that
merely adds noise.  A better approach might be <span
class="kwfade">to</span> reduce <span class="kwfade">the</span>
contrast <span class="kwfade">of</span> keywords, allowing <span
class="kwfade">the</span> reader <span class="kwfade">to</span> focus
<span class="kwfade">on the</span> informative part.  Reducing font
size (<span class="kwsmall">and</span> increasing letter-spacing <span
class="kwsmall">to</span> compensate) might also help.  Much the same
can apply to punctuation, and while this is fairly unimportant for
<em>comprehension</em> because it’s already visually distinctive, it can be a
major boon to <em>aesthetics</em>.</p>
<style>
.kwfade { opacity: 0.4 }
.kwsmall { font-size: 0.5em; letter-spacing: 0.25em; }
</style>

<p>A recent post discussed on the orange website suggested coloring
identifiers by a hash of their contents, so that <code>pcall</code> would look
very different from <code>pcal1</code>, especially to non-colorblind people.  If
you also wanted to use color to distinguish function names, type
names, and keywords, you’d need to slice up the color cube into
distinct regions for each one with a demilitarized zone between them
to permit reliable discrimination.</p>
<p>One possible significant exception to the dismissal of punctuation is
that parenthesis-matching can improve the readability of Lisp code
substantially.  Traditionally it’s done interactively (e.g., by
bouncing on % in vi or using C-M-f and C-M-b in Emacs), but by
assigning different colors and weights to different parenthesis
levels, noninteractive parenthesis matching could be facilitated.</p>
<p>The available aesthetic attributes for syntax highlighting in modern
CSS go far beyond what was traditionally available either in hot lead
or in emulated VT340+ terminals.  Even without using different
typefaces, sizes, and letter-spacing, we can oblique, drop-shadow,
change the background color, greatly vary the line width, underline
(though be careful about underlining spaces), overline, strikethrough,
compress the letterforms, and rotate the letterforms.</p>
<p>The vgrind program would call out definitions (for example, of
functions and types) by putting the name of the defined entity in the
right margin in a larger font, which was useful for paging through
printed-out listings but probably isn’t useful for a small snippet of
code with commentary around it.</p>
<h2>Where do I get the tokenizers or grammars?</h2>
<p>It would be nice to avoid writing parsers for Python, SQL, OCaml,
Scheme, MathProg, Golang, and Lua, especially fragment-tolerant and
REPL-tolerant parsers, but there’s probably no way to get around
writing parsers for things like Binate, proposed extensions of Forth,
proposed extensions of Io, and Io itself.</p>
<h3>Pygments</h3>
<p>Pygments comes with a fairly comprehensive set of lexers optimized for
this task; <code>grep --color -nH -e ^class
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pygments/lexers/*.py</code> yields a bit
over 400 matches.  Most of these contain some imperative Python code,
but Pygments has a pretty extensive set of regexp-based facilities:</p>
<pre><code>class MoinWikiLexer(RegexLexer):
    """
    For MoinMoin (and Trac) Wiki markup.

    .. versionadded:: 0.7
    """

    name = 'MoinMoin/Trac Wiki markup'
    aliases = ['trac-wiki', 'moin']
    filenames = []
    mimetypes = ['text/x-trac-wiki']
    flags = re.MULTILINE | re.IGNORECASE

    tokens = {
        'root': [
            (r'^#.*$', Comment),
            (r'(!)(\S+)', bygroups(Keyword, Text)),  # Ignore-next
            # Titles
            (r'^(=+)([^=]+)(=+)(\s*#.+)?$',
             bygroups(Generic.Heading, using(this), Generic.Heading, String)),
            # Literal code blocks, with optional shebang
            (r'(\{\{\{)(\n#!.+)?', bygroups(Name.Builtin, Name.Namespace), 'codeblock'),
            (r'(\'\'\'?|\|\||`|__|~~|\^|,,|::)', Comment),  # Formatting
            # Lists
            (r'^( +)([.*-])( )', bygroups(Text, Name.Builtin, Text)),
            (r'^( +)([a-z]{1,5}\.)( )', bygroups(Text, Name.Builtin, Text)),
            # Other Formatting
            (r'\[\[\w+.*?\]\]', Keyword),  # Macro
            (r'(\[[^\s\]]+)(\s+[^\]]+?)?(\])',
             bygroups(Keyword, String, Keyword)),  # Link
            (r'^----+$', Keyword),  # Horizontal rules
            (r'[^\n\'\[{!_~^,|]+', Text),
            (r'\n', Text),
            (r'.', Text),
        ],
        'codeblock': [
            (r'\}\}\}', Name.Builtin, '#pop'),
            # these blocks are allowed to be nested in Trac, but not MoinMoin
            (r'\{\{\{', Text, '#push'),
            (r'[^{}]+', Comment.Preproc),  # slurp boring text
            (r'.', Comment.Preproc),  # allow loose { or }
        ],
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Even things like pygments.lexers.ml.OcamlLexer (90 lines of code) are
written entirely in this declarative style without any executable
code.  As you can see above, Pygments apparently has a stack machine
for nested multi-line string constructs such as Trac code blocks or
OCaml comments.</p>
<p>One drawback of trying to use this stuff is that it relies pretty
heavily on Python’s regexp syntax, which is mostly, but not
completely, compatible with JS’s.</p>
<p>Another is that syntax-highlighting purely through tokenization
doesn’t have much chance of, for example, consistently distinguishing
user-defined types from user-defined functions.</p>
<h3>Vim</h3>
<p>Vim comes with some 586 syntax definition files; many of them are
fairly minimal.  They are written in Vimscript, which is imperative,
but most of the commands consist of defining regular
expressions — which I originally thought would be in Vim’s regexp
dialect with <code>\(\)</code> for grouping and whatnot, but which has apparently
adopted many PCRE-like features — though the backwards-incompatible
ones are turned on on a per-regexp basis by the sequence <code>\v</code>, which
means “very magic”.  Here’s Honza Pokorny’s Dockerfile syntax file:</p>
<pre><code>if exists("b:current_syntax")
    finish
endif

let b:current_syntax = "dockerfile"

syntax case ignore

syntax match dockerfileKeyword /\v^\s*(ONBUILD\s+)?(ADD|CMD|ENTRYPOINT|ENV|EXPOSE|FROM|MAINTAINER|RUN|USER|VOLUME|WORKDIR|COPY)\s/

syntax region dockerfileString start=/\v"/ skip=/\v\\./ end=/\v"/

syntax match dockerfileComment "\v^\s*#.*$"

hi def link dockerfileString String
hi def link dockerfileKeyword Keyword
hi def link dockerfileComment Comment
</code></pre>
<p>Vim also does automatic indentation, which requires a little deeper
understanding, but this is done entirely separately and with no
dependence on the syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>Consequently, even in C, like Pygments, Vim doesn’t manage to
distinguish between types and functions.</p>
<h3>Emacs</h3>
<p>Emacs does successfully distinguish between types and functions, and
it is configured in a similar way to how Vim is configured, but with
Lisp lists instead of sequences of commands, and perhaps a few more
levels of indirection.  However, some of the Emacs syntax highlighting
setup involves truly unbelievable amounts of hair.</p>
<h4>Golang in Emacs</h4>
<p>go-mode.el is relatively simple; one of the first things the <code>go-mode</code>
function does is to set <code>font-lock-defaults</code> to a list containing the
name of a function that returns a declarative configuration for syntax
highlighting as a list:</p>
<pre><code>(set (make-local-variable 'font-lock-defaults)
   '(go--build-font-lock-keywords))
</code></pre>
<p>This list is built up more or less as follows, though I've omitted
most of the individual items:</p>
<pre><code>(defun go--build-font-lock-keywords ()
  (append
   `(...)
   (if ...)
   `(...
     (,(concat (go--regexp-enclose-in-symbol "map")
               "\\[[^]]+\\]" go-type-name-regexp)
      1 font-lock-type-face) ;; map value type
     (,(concat (go--regexp-enclose-in-symbol "map")
               "\\[" go-type-name-regexp)
      1 font-lock-type-face) ;; map key type
     ...)))
</code></pre>
<p>The mysterious <code>go--regexp-enclose-in-symbol</code> function is defined as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>(defun go--regexp-enclose-in-symbol (s)
  "Enclose S as regexp symbol.
XEmacs does not support \\_&lt;, GNU Emacs does.  In GNU Emacs we
make extensive use of \\_&lt; to support unicode in identifiers.
Until we come up with a better solution for XEmacs, this solution
will break fontification in XEmacs for identifiers such as
\"typeµ\".  XEmacs will consider \"type\" a keyword, GNU Emacs
won't."
  (if (go--xemacs-p)
      (concat "\\&lt;" s "\\&gt;")
    (concat "\\_&lt;" s "\\_&gt;")))
</code></pre>
<p>The two particular items I called out earlier, which cause <code>foo</code> and
<code>bar</code> in <code>map[foo]bar</code> to be highlighted as type names, come out as
the following:</p>
<pre><code>("\\_&lt;map\\_&gt;\\[[^]]+\\]\\(?:[*(]\\)*\\(\\(?:[[:word:][:multibyte:]]+\\.\\)?[[:word:][:multibyte:]]+\\)"
1 font-lock-type-face)
("\\_&lt;map\\_&gt;\\[\\(?:[*(]\\)*\\(\\(?:[[:word:][:multibyte:]]+\\.\\)?[[:word:][:multibyte:]]+\\)"
1 font-lock-type-face)
</code></pre>
<p>This says to highlight subexpression 1 in each of those regexps as
<code>font-lock-type-face</code>, which begins at the first <code>\\(</code> that isn’t
followed by a <code>?:</code> — Emacs, too, has adopted some of Perl’s regexp
syntax, though not the good part of not having to double-backslash
things or backslash your parens at all.</p>
<p>The whole syntax-highlighting list is about a page long, mostly
regexps like that, but it also includes a call to <code>go--match-func</code>,
which parses function parameter lists to look for type names.  This
involves several pages of Elisp that does a lot of stuff like
<code>(save-excursion (if (looking-at ...) (goto-char (match-end 0))))</code>,
which is precisely the kind of thing I’d like to avoid, convenient
though it sometimes is as a way to munge text.</p>
<h4>C in Emacs</h4>
<p>By contrast, C syntax highlighting (like various other features for C)
is mostly handled by a heuristic, forgiving C parser consisting of
over ten thousand lines of Elisp written over the last 35 years in
cc-engine.el, which also handles Objective-C, C++ (including the Qt
extensions), Awk, IDL, Java, and Pike.  No test suite is evident.  As
to how it distinguishes type names from function names, I have no idea
and I might not find out tonight even if I spent the rest of the night
on it, but it does.</p>
<h3>Writing them from scratch</h3>
<p>An appealing alternative, and really the only alternative when it
comes to programming language syntax variants that I’m exploring that
nobody has ever implemented, is to write tokenizers and parsers from
scratch.  This is especially appealing if the parser can be used to
actually interpret or compile the language as well as
syntax-highlighting it, although of course if I’m just interested in
the language’s semantics and not its syntax I can quite reasonably
just serialize to S-expressions, as in <a href="../notes/implicit-language.html">A formal language for defining implicitly parameterized functions</a>, or
just RPN, like Python pickle.  But if I want compatibility with
existing code or existing implementations, parsing arbitrarily
complicated languages may be useful.</p>
<p>For interpretation, though, handling incomplete or incorrect code
isn’t necessary, and sometimes for syntax highlighting it is, though
less often than for text editing.  One possibility for that kind of
thing is to write a normal parser using some kind of parsing theory
(such as an Earley or Packrat parser) and then mechanically transform
it to produce possible parses of <em>substrings</em> of the original
language.  (This approach is also useful for parallelizing and
incrementalizing parsing; see <a href="../notes/parallel-nfa.html">Parallel NFA evaluation</a> for details.)</p>
<p>Another possibility, maybe a more interesting one, is to train a
recurrent ANN to classify syntactic elements instead.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
