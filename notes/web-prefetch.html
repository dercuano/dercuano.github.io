(1 minute)</div><p>I saw this article: “Ludicrously Fast Page Loads - A Guide for
Full-Stack Devs” <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/mj7w3d">https://lobste.rs/s/mj7w3d</a> and I thought, ‘I wonder
what counts as “ludicrously fast”?  It turns out the article never
actually explains what he means by “ludicrously fast” except that it
should be less than 5 or 10 seconds, but it still seemed like a
thought-provoking question.</p>
<p>I’d like to get below 10ms, so that even at 100fps it’s never more
than a screen refresh away.  On this shitty DSL, even pinging other
people on the same /24 as me takes 50ms, so basically nothing outside
my house is under 10ms.  So we have to prefetch.</p>
<p>(The article has good points on how to reduce your page rendering
times, but I despair of getting HTML5 and CSS to under 10ms.  By
contrast, some simpler layout models can get much faster indeed.)</p>
<p>15:15 &lt; xentrac&gt; on most internet connections, that
unavoidably involves push, but my internet connection is currently
about 2.4 megabits per second, and I can only read
                 about 70 bits per second, so the push selection algorithm could have an 0.003% hit rate (i.e. 0.003% of what it downloads is something I actually choose to 
                 look at) and still be useful
15:17 &lt; xentrac&gt; huh,
