(2 minutes)</div><p>I was thinking about Prolog as I lay in bed last night, and I came up
with this:</p>
<pre><code>%% Sorting a sequence of numbers: a constructive definition.

%% Choosing an element from a nonempty sequence:
choose([X|Xs], X, Xs).
choose([X|Xs], Y, [X|Ys]) :- choose(Xs, Y, Ys).

%% Permutations of sequences.
perm([], []).
perm([X|Xs], [A|As]) :- choose([X|Xs], A, B), perm(B, As).

%% Ordering of sequences.
ordered([]).
ordered([_]).
ordered([X, Y | Xs]) :- X =&lt; Y, ordered([Y | Xs]).

%% Sorting.
sorted(Xs, Sorted) :- perm(Xs, Sorted), ordered(Sorted).
</code></pre>
<p>This can, in fact, be used in an ordinary Prolog system to sort a
sequence of numbers:</p>
<pre><code>?- sorted([5, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 2, 6, 4], X).
X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] ;
false.
</code></pre>
<p>However, Prolog's standard evaluation order makes this a ridiculously
inefficient way to sort, taking a factorial number of steps.</p>
<p>What would you do if you wanted to evaluate this definition
efficiently?  <code>perm/2</code> with its first argument instantiated generates
its permutations left to right, and <code>ordered/1</code> inspects permutations
left to right; it is clear that no sequence of the form <code>[2, 1 | As]</code>
can ever pass <code>ordered/1</code>, so there is no need for <code>perm/2</code> to recurse
to generate alternatives for <code>As</code> in that case.  Suppose you could
propagate that nogood set from one branch of the program to the other;
would that give you an O(N²) sorting algorithm?</p>
<p>I don't think so, because in the example above, there is only one
correct initial sequence of 2 items, and 35 other pairs of 2 items
that must be tried and rejected --- but rejecting them involves trying
everything that can follow them.  I'm not totally sure.</p>
<p>This is a reasonably efficient insertion sort with Prolog's usual
semantics, but I think it's still O(N³):</p>
<pre><code>isort([], []).
isort([X | Xs], Ys) :- isort(Xs, Sx), choose(Ys, X, Sx), ordered(Ys).
</code></pre>
