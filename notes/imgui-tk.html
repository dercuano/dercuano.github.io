(8 minutes)</div><p>I wrote this example Tk program last night as an example showing how
easy Tk makes GUI development:</p>
<pre><code>scale .a -variable x -orient horizontal
entry .b -textvariable x
label .c
pack .a .b .c -side top
proc updatec {a b c} {global x; .c configure -text [expr 1.0 / $x]}
trace add variable x write updatec
</code></pre>
<p>(This leaves out the long and winding incremental road to getting it
to work, which is a strong point of Tcl: it’s interactive, everything
is a string, and everything gives you helpful error messages.  Just
that the language semantics is a shambles.)</p>
<p>I think you could quite reasonably do this same application with an
IMGUI framework in C, and maybe it would even be less code, because
you don’t have separate component states.</p>
<p>Something like this, maybe:</p>
<pre><code>static int x;
ig_scale(ig_int_model(&amp;x)); ig_horizontal();
ig_entry(ig_int_text_model(&amp;x));
float r = 1.0 / x;
ig_label(ig_float_text_model(&amp;r));
</code></pre>
<p>And yeah, it’s actually about 25% less code than the Tk version.</p>
<p>The idea for the layout is that the framework does a pass over the UI
definition function before the drawing pass to find out what sizes
everything is requesting and how they’re connected together.  (It also
does a pass over the UI definition function for each event, using the
layout from the previous frame.)  Then it computes the new layout and
does a final pass to paint everything.</p>
<p>Tk lets you pack things on all four sides of your window, which allows
you to avoid introducing frames in many cases.  I don’t think that’s
necessary here; you just need horizontal boxes and vertical boxes, for
which you need to be able to <code>ig_hbox()</code> or <code>ig_vbox()</code> to start a new
nested box, or <code>ig_end()</code> to end one of them.  Additionally we can
provide a default tabular setup, where adjacent sibling hboxes or
vboxes have their inner items aligned by default — you can add an
extra level of nesting to avoid this if necessary.</p>
<p>The <code>ig_*_model</code> functions wrap a raw pointer to the relevant type in
a model struct that is passed by value to the widget function in
question; presumably it contains a getter, a setter, and a userdata,
although you could imagine that for strings it might have slicing
functions or something.</p>
<p>Things like layout options can be provided with things like the
<code>ig_horizontal()</code> call above; at runtime it will error if the current
object doesn’t have an orientation (like scales and scrollbars do).</p>
<p>The full set of configuration options for a Tk scale widget is as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>activeBackground background bigIncrement borderWidth command cursor
digits font foreground from highlightBackground highlightColor
highlightThickness label length orient relief repeatDelay
repeatInterval resolution showValue sliderLength sliderRelief state
takeFocus tickInterval to troughColor variable width</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could imagine providing these with named member initializers in a
struct, but that requires an extra line of code to declare the struct
and doesn’t work well for options like <code>scale -to</code>, whose default is
100 but for which 0 is a valid value.  So probably supplying them with
functions (some of which perhaps take struct or multiple arguments) is
better.</p>
<p>However, if those functions are to come after the widget name, as they
should, then the actual layout or painting must happen after the
widget function itself returns — it must be deferred.  That also means
that these option functions can’t change the function’s return value,
which is relevant for, e.g., tab property pages or menu items, which
really benefit from being able to return a boolean.</p>
<h2>How Dear ImGui does it</h2>
<p>For that matter, buttons also benefit from being able to return a
boolean:</p>
<pre><code>        if (ImGui::Button("Button"))
            clicked++;
</code></pre>
<p>Dear ImGui has a <code>SameLine()</code> function which lays out the following
text (or presumably other widget) on the same line, rather than a
separate line, as per default.  A possible hbox-oriented alternative
would be a <code>ig_endl()</code> function which ends the current hbox and starts
a new one.  This is still more modeful, but it avoids having multiple
mechanisms for the same purpose, and it avoids needing 5 <code>SameLine</code>
calls to get 6 things into an hbox.</p>
<p>(Dear ImGui also has a horizontal mode.)</p>
<p>This treenode thing is a thing I really like about Dear ImGui:</p>
<pre><code>if (ImGui::CollapsingHeader("Configuration")) {
    if (ImGui::TreeNode("Configuration##2")) {
        ImGui::CheckboxFlags("io.ConfigFlags: NavEnableKeyboard", (unsigned int *)&amp;io.ConfigFlags, ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard);
</code></pre>
<p>Radio buttons share a model and specify a value:</p>
<pre><code>        static int e = 0;
        ImGui::RadioButton("radio a", &amp;e, 0); ImGui::SameLine();
        ImGui::RadioButton("radio b", &amp;e, 1); ImGui::SameLine();
        ImGui::RadioButton("radio c", &amp;e, 2);
</code></pre>
<p>Dear ImGui requires a PushID/PopID call in loops:</p>
<pre><code>        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++)
        {
            ImGui::PushID(i);
            …
            ImGui::PopID();
        }
</code></pre>
<p>It identifies clickable widgets with an “ID stack”, which I guess is
sort of like a pathname; windows and tree nodes push onto the ID
stack.  Within a window it normally uses the button (or whatever)
label and hashes it, so there are hacks you have to use if you want to
animate the label or whatever; the <code>"Configuration##2"</code> in the example
above is one such hack — the 2 isn't displayed, but forms part of the
ID.  As a result, you need to call <code>TreePop</code> to end a treenode.</p>
<p>Within the implementation of treenodes, to find out if the treenode is
open, TreeNodeBehaviorIsOpen fetches from <code>window-&gt;DC.StateStorage</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    is_open = storage-&gt;GetInt(id, (flags &amp; ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_DefaultOpen) ? 1 : 0) != 0;
</code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<pre><code>    if (toggled)
    {
        is_open = !is_open;
        window-&gt;DC.StateStorage-&gt;SetInt(id, is_open);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>StateStorage is a per-window sorted ImVector of key-value pairs, where
the values are unions.  It’s amusing to me that the id is hashed with
a CRC32 of the string, but then they don’t bother to use a hash table
to store it, instead resorting to binary search; but they expect to do
insertions, as opposed to updates, quite rarely.  Still, you’d think
that would favor cuckoo hash tables rather than binary search.</p>
<p>The ID construct results in weird things where clicking on one button
will activate another one, and so forth.  Presumably it could result
in a case where this happened even if the buttons had different IDs
just because of a hash collision.</p>
<p>A convenient thing about Dear ImGui is that most (all?) of the
widgets take printf format strings and varargs.</p>
<p>Dear Imgui labels everything with its ID string by default, since for
usability you probably want to know what you’re setting anyway.</p>
<p>Perhaps the other thing to beat in this space is REBOL’s Visual
Interface Dialect: <a href="http://rebol.com/docs/view-guide.html">http://rebol.com/docs/view-guide.html</a>.  An
example from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebol">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebol</a>:</p>
<pre><code>view layout [text "Hello world!" button "Quit" [quit]]
</code></pre>
<p>Or in REBOL R3-GUI:</p>
<pre><code>view [text "Hello world!" button "Quit" on-action [quit]]
</code></pre>
<p>Examples from <a href="http://rebol.com/docs/easy-vid.html">http://rebol.com/docs/easy-vid.html</a>:</p>
<pre><code>style yell tt 220 bold underline yellow font-size 16
yell "Hello"
yell "This is big old text."
yell "Goodbye"

vtext bold "Wild Thing" effect [gradient 200.0.0 0.0.200]
</code></pre>
<p>Here %. is the current directory:</p>
<pre><code>vh2 "File List:"
text-list data read %.
button "Great!"
</code></pre>
<p>Here a “pair” specifies geometry:</p>
<pre><code>button 200 "Big Button"
button 200x100 "Huge Button"
image %palms.jpg 50x50
image %palms.jpg 150x50
</code></pre>
<p>A file filtered to purple provides the backdrop for a button, behind
the “Button” text:</p>
<pre><code>button "Button" %palms.jpg purple
</code></pre>
<p>This action assigns <code>value</code> to a refinement of another widget and then
invokes <code>show</code> on the widget:</p>
<pre><code>slider 200x16 [p1/data: value show p1]
p1: progress
</code></pre>
<p>At least in R3-GUI, the layout is tabular:
<a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/gui/panels.html">http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/gui/panels.html</a> explains that this has
four columns:</p>
<pre><code>view [
    panel 4 [
        button "First"
        button "Second"
        button "Third"
        button "Fourth"
        button "Fifth"
        button "Sixth"
    ]
]
