<p>I tried designing a super-simple holographic ECC scheme, and although
it does work, it bloats the message by an order of magnitude before it
stops being an error-introduction code instead of an error-correction
code.  The scheme is described below, in case someone wants to try to
rescue it.</p>
<p>RESCUE: MAKE THE MATRIX SPARSE AND COMPARE POPCOUNTS OF ZERO-DERIVED
AND ONE-DERIVED CODEWORDS!  popcount(num &amp; row) &gt; popcount(~num &amp; row).</p>
<p>To encode a block of N (preferably N is odd) bits into a block of M
bits, where normally M&gt;N, use a M×N matrix of random bits defining the
code.  Invert (NOT) each of the N columns that corresponds to a 1 bit,
which is to say, XOR each of the M rows with the N bits you are
attempting to encode.  The M-bit codeword is then the majority-rule of
each of the M rows of the output matrix: if it contains more 1 bits
than 0 bits, then the output is 1, and otherwise 0.  To decode, you
apply the same process, but with the original matrix transposed.</p>
<p>Why should we expect this to work?  The output bits are a holographic
representation of the input bits.  Each bit in the matrix represents a
coupling between the probability that a given output bit is 1 and the
input.  If a column happened to be all 1s, then it would slightly
increase the probability for each output bit to be 0 when the
corresponding input bit was 1, or 1 when the corresponding input bit
was zero.  If there are enough output bits, and the other columns are
uncorrelated, then this will probably flip a few of them — enough that
the majority of output bits will correctly reconstruct the original
input bit.</p>
<p>This can be implemented with somewhat reasonable efficiency (a few
machine instructions per bit) on normal CPUs now that the NSA has
finally pushed a POPCOUNT instruction into them; or at extremely high
speed in hardware.</p>
<p>This Python code, encoding and decoding a message, shows
that this works in practice if M is large enough.  However, it seems
that M needs to be almost always 8× and often 16× larger than N for it
to work, so in practice this code is dramatically worse not only than
Reed-Solomon codes, but in fact worse even than just repeating the
message several times.</p>

<p>I learned about codes like these from reading a paper of Pentti
Kanerva’s on “Fully Distributed Representation” around 2000.</p>
<p>Possible ways to rescue this scheme might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A smaller number of points in the output vector, but more than one
  bit of information for these points?</li>
<li>Deploying the single bit of information per point more judiciously?
  For example, maybe only set 1 when the population count exceeds some
  threshold?  (This seems doomed to worsen the code rather than
  improving it!)</li>
<li>Matrix columns that are exactly uncorrelated instead of
  approximately uncorrelated?  For example, Hadamard words.</li>
<li>Actually working out the probability distributions for output bits
  and thinking about that?</li>
