(2 minutes)</div><p>Can you synthesize textures using particle filters?</p>
<p>The idea is that for each position (block of pixels, or maybe pixel),
you have a model of what might appear there, based on what appears
above it and to its left, determined by the conditional probabilities
of that patch in those environments in some kind of a training set.
You maintain a potentially large set of hypotheses for each position,
each one with a weight representing its probability weight.  When you
move to a new position, you resample the set of hypotheses according
to the weights, and ultimately you may end up with a few hypotheses
with most of the probability weight and you can choose one or average
them.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about this is that it allows you to take into
account different kinds of information in many different ways.  For
example, you could know most of the pixels in an image and want to
fill in a few (perhaps to replace something you erased or to fill in a
seam), or you could attempt to synthesize an image from nothing, or
you could try to synthesize an image that approximates some pattern of
light and dark, or that has edges in particular places.</p>
<p>This seems to have been done to some extent;

resolution micrograph synthesis using a parametric texture model and a
particle filter”, 2013) describes using this algorithm to fill in
plausible high-resolution detail on a large low-resolution image by
using texture from small high-resolution images.  But I think this may
be a slightly different algorithm.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
