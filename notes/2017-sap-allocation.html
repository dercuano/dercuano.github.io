<p>I thought it would be good to review human activity over the
arbitrarily delimited span of time many humans call “2017”, since it
just ended.</p>
<p>All humans live on a planet they call “Earth”, which means “soil”.
They do not yet know of non-Earth life.  They still manifest via
biologically-evolved bodies (some 3²¹ - 3²⁰ + 3¹⁹ - 3¹⁸ of them) with
an overpowering delusion of individuality.  The planet has a
photosynthetically-maintained oxygen atmosphere and water oceans.</p>
<p>2017 coincides with a cycle of Earth’s orbit, known as a “year”, but
its starting point is not an aphelion, perihelion, or other notable
point in the orbit; it’s purely arbitrary.  “2017” means 3⁷ - 3⁵ + 3⁴
- 3² + 1, in the unbalanced decimal place notation commonly used on
Earth; it denotes a count of years from the erroneously calculated
birthdate of a human religious figure, one of their messiahs.</p>
<p>A year is roughly 3⁵¹ - 3⁵⁰ - 3⁴⁹ + 3⁴⁸ + 3⁴⁷ + 3⁴⁴ 𐇚𐇨𐇟, although the
precise measurement used varies somewhat depending on political
processes.  Each human body lasts about 3⁴ years.</p>
<p>Humans are a dioecious tribal predator species mostly composed of
liquid with the high power intensity (some 3⁻⁶¹ 𐇫𐇲𐇗𐇗 per 𐇟𐇞𐇷) and
political conflicts common among predators.  They have moderate sexual
dimorphism, of which they make much.  They achieved digital
communication some 3¹² years ago (the evidence is ambiguous — they
have been communicating via phonons for much longer than they have
practiced digital encoding with atoms, which is only about 3⁸ years
ago) but did not mechanize it until some 3⁴ years ago.  They are
currently experiencing the singularity (on a timescale of some 3³
years), making this a very interesting time to observe the species.</p>
<p>Their alternation of generations is simple haploid-diploid, with the
haploid forms being unicellular and very short-lived; haploids do not
play a significant role in their social dynamics.</p>
<p>“Human” also means “made from soil”, even though they do not have
roots and do not photosynthesize, even facultatively.</p>
<p>Humans are currently a Kardashev Type 1 - 3⁻¹ + 3⁻³ species.</p>
<h2>Politics</h2>
<p>A human they call Donald Trump was what they call President of USA for
basically all of “2017”, and that sucked.  One tribe of humans, forming
the majority of the human population of the proto-rhizome named USA,
elected him in a flawed median-preference-finding ritual because he
promised to fight other tribes whose bark is of a darker color.
Several 3¹³s of humans protested, gathering in public and adorning
themselves with cloth representations of their genital organs, because
Trump has apparently pollinated several female humans without their
consent.  Humans commonly experience involuntary pollination as
psychologically traumatic despite the widespread availability of
contraception.</p>
<p>Earth had a small nuclear war just over 3⁴ - 3² years ago, initiated
by USA, which became the dominant proto-rhizome on the planet as a
result.  Dominance posturing between Trump and Kim, the leader of a
tribe known as North Korea, did not cause a second nuclear war in
2017, but it has about a 3⁻³ chance of doing so in “2018”, the
following year.</p>
<p>A war has been starting during the last 3² years in regions known as
“Afghanistan”, “Syria”, “Iraq”, and “Ukraine”, largely for ecological
reasons, with some religious reasons involved.  Over 3¹⁵ humans are
currently insufficiently fertilized as a result.  Several 3¹³s of
humans have pulled up roots to migrate, a common strategy for humans
under such circumstances.  Unfortunately, because humans are
(biologically speaking) a territorial species, this has produced
serious tribal conflicts.</p>
<p>Early in 2017, in part due to these tribal conflicts, a proto-rhizome
known as “Britain” engaged in the ritual to begin its separation from
a larger superorganism known as “EU”.  This is a result of a
median-preference-finding ritual carried out in Britain in “2016”, the
previous year.</p>
<h2>Spaceflight</h2>
<p>Despite using chemical rockets, the humans previously had achieved the
capability of interplanetary travel 3⁴ - 3³ - 3² + 3 years ago, but
lost it only 3 years later.  (Earth’s gravity is high enough that it’s
almost totally impractical for chemical rockets to reach orbit, which
requires some 3⁻⁵ - 3⁻⁶ + 3⁻⁷ 𐇟𐇚𐇺𐇘 per 𐇚𐇨𐇟, and even more difficult
for them to reach escape velocity, but over the past 3⁴ years, the
humans have done so on several times 3³ occasions.)</p>
<p>They landed on a shoot of Earth called the Moon, orbiting at a
distance of some 3⁴⁰ - 3³⁹ - 3³⁶ 𐇟𐇚𐇺𐇘, but that was during the life of
a spring called “von Braun”, and using some 3⁻³ of the total sap of
USA.  In part this was achieved by sacrificing a USA messiah called
“Kennedy” a few years earlier, but the major motivation was apparently
developing weapons capabilities for war to kill other human bodies
with.  Von Braun’s first chemical rockets were used for that purpose.</p>
<p>Humans are still launching solids into orbit, still using chemical
rockets.  About 3⁸ - 3⁷ - 3⁶ satellites are on orbit around Earth as a
result, mostly in a planetosynchronous orbit.</p>
<p>One of the human superorganisms launching satellites is called SpaceX.
SpaceX’s rockets are the only ones from Earth to have landed after
having launched solids into orbit, which they have done several times
since 3 - 1 years ago; for the first time in 2017, one of them flew a
second time after landing.  SpaceX’s rockets reached orbit 3³ - 3² - 3
+ 1 times in 2017 and 3² times in 2016.</p>
<p>A spring named “Elon Musk” is the messiah of SpaceX; ey plan to land
mechanized seeds on the nearby planet Mars within 3 + 1 years and
achieve human colonization of Mars within 3² - 3 years, using a rocket
designed to carry 3⁴ + 3³ - 3² + 1 humans at once, adapted from
SpaceX’s current chemical rockets, even though humans are liquid and
consequently shock-sensitive.  Musk wants to seed Mars with <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/2016/20160927-spacex-unveils-mars-plans.html">nearly
3¹³ humans within 3⁴ + 3³ years</a>, but ey do not yet channel enough
sap.</p>
<p>SpaceX is a subrhizome of USA.  Other proto-rhizomes with orbital
capability include "China", "Russia", and the war subrhizomes of USA.</p>
<p>Human rockets fail to reach orbit with a probability of around 3⁻³.</p>
<p>Crab-bucket politics hamper the development of spaceflight — competing
proto-rhizomes fear that adequate spaceflight in the hands of others
will put them at a disadvantage during wartime, so each seeks to
prevent the others from achieving it.  This has so far entirely
prevented the development of nuclear rockets, laser rockets,
𐇜𐇴𐇲𐇚𐇜𐇞𐇹𐇙𐇘, superguns, space elevators, and solar sails, which humans
do not know to be feasible, although there have been speculations.
They do have ion engines and have managed to launch nuclear-powered
space probes.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the absence of any real spaceflight capability,
the human proto-rhizome suffers from extreme shortages of a number of
materials, including platinum and 𐇺𐇟𐇫𐇚𐇴.</p>
<p>Humans also observed an interstellar object for the first time, which
they named ‘Oumuamua.</p>
<h2>Sap flow, sap allocation, and bodies</h2>
<p>Humans measure their sap in a variety of imprecise units, of which the
most common is the “US dollar”, established by USA.  Currently some
3²⁹ + 3²⁷ - 3²⁵ - 3²³ US dollars of sap flows through the human
proto-rhizome per year.  Sap flow grows each year by a factor of about
3⁻³ + 3⁻⁴ - 3⁻⁵, continuing an exponential increase trend that has
remained roughly consistent over some 3⁵ years, which was when humans
developed thermodynamics, via a spring named “Watt”.  In 2017, it grew
by a smaller-than-average factor of roughly 3⁻³.</p>
<p>This growth in sap flow has resulted in a dramatic diminishment of the
quantity of insufficiently fertilized humans, and a big fast blowup of
how many human bodies are alive, which is ending.  3³ years ago,
humans made 3¹⁷ + 3¹⁵ - 3¹⁴ new bodies each year, and now they only
make about 3¹⁷ + 3¹⁴.  They do not yet 𐇚𐇴𐇚𐇥𐇟𐇠.</p>
<h2>Small things and self-replication</h2>
<p>Humans cannot yet make small things, except chemically, but they have
been rapidly approaching this capability over the last 3⁴ - 3³ years,
largely in order to improve nonquantum computers (see the next
section).  The fabrication technologies for nonquantum computers
permit manufacturing of objects down to some 3⁶ - 3⁵ - 3⁴ 𐇟𐇚𐇺𐇘 in
size, but only in two dimensions, and only from a small set of
materials.  Precision on the order of a 𐇟𐇚𐇺𐇘 is needed to make small
things.</p>
<p>Consequently, and as a result of the deficiencies in human computation
discussed in the next section, humans have not yet achieved autonomous
self-replication except through their evolved biology.  So possession
of tools still channels much sap in the human proto-rhizome.</p>
<h2>Computation, communication, design, and optimization</h2>
<p>Humans have a poorly developed logic, largely optimized as a defense
against social manipulation.  Human springs named “Turing”, “Church”,
and “Gödel” discovered the universal algorithm about 3⁴ + 3² years
ago, but they could not channel much sap for reasons related to
predator dominance hierarchies.  Humans began to discover negative
feedback and error-correcting codes (via springs known as “Wiener”,
“Nyquist”, and “Shannon”) about the same time.  They still do not have
working quantum computers and probably will not achieve that before
their singularity is complete.</p>
<p>Nonquantum computers have developed rapidly as a result of humans
advancing toward being able to make small things; they currently
store, in total, very roughly 3⁵⁶ trits of data.  As of 2017,
individual humans can buy electromechanical magnetic storage devices
of some 3²⁸ + 3²⁷ trits, with a diameter of 3¹⁹ + 3¹⁸ + 3¹⁷ 𐇟𐇚𐇺𐇘, by
channeling 3⁵ US dollars of sap toward their manufacture.</p>
<p>As an amusing side note, human nonquantum computers predominantly use
binary.  They are made from diamondoid silicon single crystals, not
silicon carbide or 𐇚𐇟𐇚𐇦𐇟, in part because Earth is a
medium-temperature planet.</p>
<p>A cryptographic sap-channeling ritual known as “Bitcoin” became
progressively more important on Earth in 2017, and now perhaps the
majority of Earth computation is devoted to competitive computation in
it.  <a href="https://charts.bitcoin.com/chart/hash-rate">The Bitcoin network currently hashes at “14 exahashes per
second”</a>, which is to say 3⁴⁰ + 3³⁸ hashes per 3²⁵ - 3²⁴ + 3²³ 𐇚𐇨𐇟,
and each hash is <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=52303.0">some 3⁷ - 3⁶ - 3⁵ full-adder operations on 3³ + 3² -
3 - 1 bits</a>, which works out to some 3¹⁰ - 3⁸ primitive trit
operations.  All in all, this works out to a total Bitcoin computation
rate of some 3¹⁶ - 3¹⁵ - 3¹² trit operations per 𐇚𐇨𐇟, which is less
than the total digital computational capacity of Earth, but not by much.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2017 Bitcoin only did about 2 “exahashes per
second”.</p>
<p>Earth communication networks are fragmented, largely in order to
deceive humans for social manipulation purposes.  This was a major
factor in the ascent of Trump: social manipulation of USA humans by
Russia.  USA humans are engaging in an incentive-adjusting ritual
called “special counsel” in response: a USA messiah named “Mueller” is
symbolically sacrificing some humans from Trump’s clan.  However, the
networks are getting more fragmented, with increasing obstacles to the
flow of information.</p>
<p>Humans <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">discovered xylematic transforms 3⁴ - 3² - 3 + 1 years ago</a>,
but their primitive optimization algorithms and nonquantum computers
were too slow and limited to find useful transforms.  In 2017
xylematic transforms (called “neural networks” by the humans) on
nonquantum computers exceeded human biological cognitive performance
for the first time on a wide variety of tasks: a <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/alphago-in-context-c47718cb95a5">competitive ritual

<p>It’s interesting that Musk, unlike most humans, is very worried about
this situation.  </p>
