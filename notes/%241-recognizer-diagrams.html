(15 minutes)</div><p>I read the 2007 “<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/uist-07.01.pdf">$1 recognizer</a>” paper the other day.  It describes a
simple “unistroke recognizer” you can implement in 100 lines of code
or so to experiment with pen-based gestures, like PalmPilot Graffiti;
they report on a user study on an Itsy (or rather an iPAQ) where it
compared reasonably well to a couple of other stroke recognition
algorithms popular in the research literature.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that something like the $1 recognizer might be a
viable solution to my problem in <a href="../notes/dercuano-drawings.html">Dercuano drawings</a>, namely, how
to illustrate the notes in Dercuano without using either too much of
my time or too many bytes.</p>
<h2>The $1 recognizer algorithm</h2>
<p>For the $1 recognizer, a pen gesture consists of a sequence of (x, y)
points; its task is to match this sequence against a collection of
“template” gestures and provide a list of gestures that match most
closely.</p>
<p>The first point in the sequence is where the pen first touched the
tablet, and the others are samples of the pen’s position taken over
time until it is lifted.  These trace out some kind of more or less
continuous curve on the display, but the position of each individual
point along that curve is just a matter of how far the pen had gotten
when the sampling clock fired.</p>
<p>So, the first thing the algorithm does is resample the curve to a
uniform point spacing, using a fixed, predetermined number of points
that is the same for every gesture.  They found that numbers in the
range 64–256 worked best.  The resampling algorithm they used is
fairly naïve, just linearly interpolating between points.  This step
normalizes the drawing speed and the relative phase of the sampling
clock and the drawing operations, so that exactly the same curve
traced at different speeds will result in very nearly the same set of
points.</p>
<p>People are also not absolutely precise about the angle, position,
scale, and aspect ratio of their pen gestures, so the next steps in
the algorithm are to try to normalize out these features.  The points
are rotated around their centroid so that the gesture starting point
is at 0 degrees.  The X and Y coordinates are then given independent
affine transforms to fit them into a predefined 1×1 bounding box, thus
eliminating variations of position, scale, and aspect ratio.  Finally,
this normalized sequence of points is compared against each
(normalized) template by calculating the average Euclidean distance
between corresponding points — not once, but with a series of
different candidate rotations using golden-section search, based on
their observation that the rotation-distance function had no local
minima on correct matches.</p>
<p>Remarkably, they reported 99% accuracy on a vocabulary of 16 unistroke
symbols in their tests, varying very little with stroke speed; the
fastest strokes were around half a second, so this amounts to around
8 bits per second of input bandwidth.</p>
<h2>The nature of diagrams</h2>
<p>Diagrams have a few freehand lines, but are mostly symbolic — aside
from textual labels, they mostly consist of many repetitions of a
relatively small number of different symbols, at different positions,
orientations, and sometimes scales or aspect ratios.  So bubble charts
contain bubbles, connecting lines, and arrowheads; circuit diagrams
contain resistors, capacitors, inductors, grounds, horizontal and
vertical wires, rectangles representing chips, junctions, and so on;
various kinds of diagrams contain different kinds of boxes.  Some of
these kinds of symbols can be freely rotated, while others cannot.
Other variations between different instances of the same symbol are
usually random and need not be stored.</p>
<p>Also, diagrams commonly contain significant topology, quite aside from
their possibly significant geometry, and often it’s helpful to “snap”
certain connection points together, and if a symbol is later moved, to
update connected symbols so that they remain connected.</p>
<p>Diagrams in such a form can be quite reasonably represented as a set
of references to symbols, each associated with a position,
orientation, scale, and possibly aspect ratio.  The symbols themselves
can possibly be shared between multiple diagrams or embedded in one
diagram.</p>
<h2>Drawing diagrams with pen gestures</h2>
<p>It occurs to me that a pen gesture interface is probably one of the
most straightforward ways to create diagrams; it offers the
possibility of smoothly scaling from a pure sketching interface to a
much more formal interface.  The basic idea is that you put a series
of strokes on a canvas, and the system (initially devoid of symbol
definitions) tries to figure out which strokes belong to the same
symbol, using something like the $1 recognizer; when it gets it wrong,
you correct it after the fact.</p>
<p>By translating, rotating, and scaling the graphic for each symbol to
match the original stroke you input it with, the system redraws your
diagram.  By remembering all of your strokes, it gradually improves
the definition of each symbol, improving the appearance of your
diagram, without overly interfering with the sketching process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can explicitly edit symbols; for example, in a
circuit diagram, you might want your ordinary wire symbols to be only
horizontal or vertical, so you might want non-rotatable horizontal and
vertical line symbols.  A small vocabulary of such non-rotatable
symbols (boxes, ellipses, lines, arrowheads) would be adequate for
many quick diagramming tasks.  You might want to add or move
attachment points, add synonym templates, toggle rendering of noise,
add additional rendered decorations you don’t need to sketch
explicitly (including other symbols, as in <a href="../notes/recursive-curves.html">Recursive curves</a>),
and so on.</p>
<p>If you were to write text in such an interface, it would ideally
discover the relatively small number of letters you were using and
represent your “diagram” as a list of letters and their positions.</p>
<p>Aside from the above fuzzy spectrum between defining symbols and
freehand drawing, you’d probably want the usual kinds of drawing
operations: undo, redo, move, rotate, scale, multiple selection, and
so on.</p>
<h3>Doing it on hand-computer touchscreens</h3>
<p>Realizing such a fluent interface with the non-ideal hardware
available is a substantial challenge.  In practice multitouch
cellphone touchscreens are what I have available, and these have
relatively crude touchstart and touchend resolution, although they’re
fairly precise during the touch (and some of them are even fast, like
60 Hz, while others are more like 10 Hz); moreover, they have major
finger occlusion problems.</p>
<p>Using the quasimodal multitouch ideas outlined in <a href="../notes/interactive-calculator.html">Interactive calculator</a>, <a href="../notes/two-thumb-quasimodal.html">Two-thumb quasimodal multitouch interaction techniques</a>, and <a href="../notes/interactive-geometry.html">Interactive geometry</a>, I think this can be overcome: a transparent
virtual stylus projects from your finger upon first touch, and a
button elsewhere on the display starts the ink running out of it.
This allows you to reposition the stylus before you start drawing and
stop drawing before you lift your finger, and it greatly reduces the
finger-occlusion problem.  It also conflicts less with the
now-standard one-finger-drag scrolling gesture.</p>
<h3>Rounding</h3>
<p>For Dercuano, as mentioned in <a href="../notes/dercuano-drawings.html">Dercuano drawings</a>, I want to
round off coordinates to reduce the amount of space they take up in
the rendered output, although more bloat can be accepted in the source
code.  Symbol definitions that have been drawn many times offer a way
to do this: the Platonic location of a point whose drawn location is
highly variable the various times I drew the symbol can be safely
rounded to any convenient precision that doesn’t take it too far
outside the zone where it’s being drawn.  Moreover, maybe we should
weight that point less heavily when we’re matching templates.  The
user should have the option as to whether to draw that point with
per-symbol-instance noise or not.</p>
<p>Other points whose position can be interpolated to reasonable
precision (either with a spline or with a line) also do not need to be
stored for graphical display.</p>
<p>The problem of coming up with a minimal-length description of a
polyline that stays within the usual limits of drawn instances of the
symbol is an optimization problem that can be solved using the usual
kinds of search approaches for offline optimization problems.</p>
<h3>Repetition</h3>
<p>If you draw the same symbol several times in a row, perhaps in a
linear or circular path with systematic variation in position, angle,
or size, it’s possible that you would like to continue drawing more of
it; since the system is categorizing each stroke as a symbol and
redrawing it, a reasonable thing for it to do in such a case is to
offer further repetitions, perhaps in a different color, with a slider
to accept one or more of those repetitions.</p>
<h3>Interpolation</h3>
<p>One of the attractive features of resampling all the strokes to a
uniform number of points is that it makes it easy to interpolate
between them, for example, linearly.  In drawing editing, this could
be used for several different things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By defining a subspace from two or more templates, you can draw a
   stroke that indicates simultaneously a location in that
   <em>N</em>-dimensional subspace as well as a location, rotation, scale,
   skew, and stretch in the display space.  In this case, the final
   operation from the $1 recognizer of calculating the sum of
   Euclidean distances to measure the distance from a stroke to a
   template is replaced by projecting your stroke onto that subspace,
   then measuring its distance from that projection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using two or three templates to define a subspace of one or two
   dimensions, you can map an area of the display to a subspace of the
   many-dimensional stroke space.  By dragging around this subspace,
   you can explore variations within that space to instantiate in your
   drawing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By drawing a path through such a subspace, you can define an
   <em>animation</em>.  This may work better with a K-nearest-neighbors kind
   of interpolation so that you can place more than three templates
   into a two-dimensional space.  This path might be drawn
   synchronously as a draft animation plays — unlike the stroke used
   for stroke recognition, its timing <em>is</em> important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course you can also do animations morphing strokes with standard
   tweening functions such as ease-in/ease-out and linear
   interpolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When doing repetition, as described in the previous section, if the
   repetitive strokes map onto one of the one-dimensional subspaces
   found between existing templates, they could indicate a gradual
   transition; for example, a series of curved lines gradually
   becoming more straight could indicate a morphing progression that
   could be continued to straightness and possibly beyond.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Improving the $1 recognizer</h2>
<h3>Alternative template matching algorithms</h3>
<p>The $1 recognizer mostly tries to normalize rather than using search,
but even so, the researchers apparently found it necessary to use
search for angular alignment to get competitive results.  In some
cases, they seem to have used fairly fragile statistics in order to
keep the algorithm accessible to mathematically naïve users: the
normalization of X and Y coordinates using the bounding box means that
noise in the X coordinate of the single leftmost and rightmost points
will be distributed across all the points, and the
linear-interpolation resampling scheme guarantees that such noise will
occur.</p>
<p>The search used for the optimal rotation is the old-fashioned
golden-section search algorithm, which has the advantage of being
derivative-free, but has quite slow convergence (slower than binary
chop!) and also makes rather strong assumptions about the input.</p>
<p>(An alternative way to match against a template that is insensitive to
translation, scaling, and rotation, though not aspect ratio, would be
least-squares linear regression in ℂ, the complex-number field.  I’ve
never done linear regression in ℂ, but I think it’s a straightforward
extension of linear regression in ℝ.)</p>
<p>One approach to improving the algorithm would be to use more robust
statistics.  For example, you could use the standard deviation or
quantiles to determine the X and Y scaling factors, and you could use
an angle that depends in some way on all the points instead of just
the first point to get the initial rotation.</p>
<p>Perhaps a simpler approach, though, is to use a generic optimization
algorithm.  The function to optimize is already present: it’s the
average Euclidean distance from the points of the transformed input
stroke to the corresponding points of the template stroke.  The
objective is to find the transformation that minimizes it; the
translation in X and Y, rotation around some arbitrary center, and
scaling in X and Y, form five continuously variable parameters out of
the six in an arbitrary 2-D affine transformation.  (The sixth missing
parameter is diagonal shear, and I’m not sure it should be omitted.)
With modern automatic differentiation, it should be straightforward to
use a generic optimization algorithm like Adam or a quasi-Newton
method to search this parameter space for the best fit.  This would
probably result in a much simpler algorithm, and possibly a faster one
as well.</p>
<p>This also allows extreme aspect ratios and rotations to be penalized
in a smoother fashion than the original $1-recognizer algorithm.</p>
<p>Using a better resampling algorithm would probably help somewhat as
well.</p>
<h3>Indexing</h3>
<p>Another issue with the algorithm is that it doesn’t really permit any
kind of indexing of the templates; if you are matching each new
unistroke against a database of 10,000 64-point templates, it is going
to take 640,000 Euclidean-distance computations.</p>
<p>The above hacks
don’t help much with indexing, but perhaps absurdly-downsampled
versions of the gesture and templates could be used to get a linear
speedup on to searching a large index of candidate glyphs — like 4
or 8 points.  Some kind of interval-arithmetic categorization or
something is needed if you’re going to get a superlinear speedup — some
way to put a lower bound on the best distance to any template in
a given group, so that you can avoid iterating over the templates in
the group.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might be able to use linear-algebra techniques to
speed up the search; if a smallish number of low-dimensional subspaces
nearly contain most of the templates (as determined by PCA on subsets
of the templates), you can project a user stroke onto each of those
subspaces to find out which are plausible candidates (and which are
too far away), then perhaps use a k-d tree on the remaining principal
components.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
