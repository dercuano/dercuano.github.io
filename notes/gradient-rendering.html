<p>I responded:</p>

<p>I was thinking about using your prefix-sum approach for exactly that
almost all of last night. I don’t have an attack on the problem that
I’m satisfied with yet:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Render each path to a fresh pixel buffer, alpha-compositing it
   down onto the final canvas. Advantage: straightforward, works for
   sure. Disadvantage: you need a lot of multiplies per pixel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partition paths into “layers” of nonoverlapping paths, render
   each layer as a unit, and composite each new layer down onto the
   final canvas. Overlapping opaque paths can be incorporated into
   the same layer as whatever is below them by cutting an
   overlap-shaped hole in what’s below before adding in the new
   path; although that involves some intersection tests to know
   where to stop, my intuition is that it will be a big
   win. Advantages: straightforward, probably faster than the
   previous one. Disadvantages: the partitioning is a potentially
   costly extra step (one of those things that makes me wonder if
   it’s NP-complete to do it optimally), and there are still
   potentially many multiplies per pixel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separately accumulate a numerator (total premultiplied color) and
   denominator (total alpha) for each pixel, then divide in the
   end. Advantages: You avoid doing lots of work per
   pixel. Disadvantages: This is a weighted sum, not alpha
   blending. Alpha blending is a different thing. So the result is
   wrong. Also, an honest division per pixel is more expensive than
   quite a number of multiplications, although maybe you could cheat
   on the final division with a table of approximate multiplicative
   inverses or something. So this would probably be super slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a different group other than ℤ/256ℤ in which to do
   prefix-sum that somehow gives you the right results. Then you can
   just render all the edges into the same buffer and do a single
   vectorizable prefix-sum operation over it.</p>
<p>Advantages: This sounds super fast.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: It seems clear that this group is going to have
to be able to represent the entire Z-ordered stack of colors at
every pixel, because if I’m looking at some translucent green on
top of translucent red on top of opaque black on top of pale
blue, and I reach the right (negative) edge of the opaque black
path, somehow I have to have remembered the blue thing
underneath in order for it to peek through, which suggests to me
that I need an unbounded number of bits per pixel to implement
this scheme, which probably is not going to admit an actually
fast implementation. In effect it has to reduce to the second
approach, except that the software has to deal with the stack of
layers once for every pixel. Or is there some magical way around
this, at least for a fast-path case?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This part is probably obvious to you, Raph, but you can do SVG
linear gradients with two prefix-sum passes instead of one, where
the first pass just runs over signed gradient stops and gradient
clipping boundaries, and then you draw the signed path boundaries
into the buffer before the second prefix-sum pass. (Is that clear? I
suspect it may be too abbreviated.)</p>
<p>I suspect that with three prefix-sum passes you could do a decent
quadratic-spline† approximation of arbitrary gradients, including
the weird skew cone gradients SVG calls “radial gradients”. But I
haven’t worked out the details.</p>
<p>I know you don’t have a lot of time to hack on this stuff right now,
but would you have time to provide feedback if I were to hack on it
a bit? I imagine that I’d run into any number of places where
talking to you about it for half an hour could save me days of
wasted effort.</p>
<p>† here I’m talking about what Carl de Boor calls “splines”, which I
know disagrees with your usage of “splines”. I think you called them
“B-splines” in your dissertation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might have seen Raph's recent article on <a href="https://medium.com/@raphlinus/inside-the-fastest-font-renderer-in-the-world-75ae5270c445">font-rs</a>, where he
observes that the color of a pixel in an antialiased painted polygon is
the prefix sum of the signed edge coverages, and prefix sum is a thing
you can do super fast with SSE.</p>
<p>Dan Amelang's work with Gezira and Nile is pretty inspiring to me, and
the idea that you could get enough performance out of modern hardware to
not have to worry about precaching font glyphs or really anything else
is pretty neat.  And hey, AAA games rerender each frame more or less
from scratch, right?  And in 3D at that.</p>
<p>I've had pretty good experiences hacking together stuff in SVG,
especially with the little bit of data binding provided by D3 — you end
up with a buttload of code, but you have a lot of control over how
things look, and you seem to have pretty good composability, even if
there's a large constant factor.  It's just kind of like writing stuff
in assembly, but less error-prone.  (So maybe the verbosity problem of
D3 is a shallow problem that could be solved with a better surface
notation, like BLISS or Thompson's B instead of assembly?)</p>
<p>Amelang's Gezira, as I understand it, uses a single graphical primitive:
a path made of quadratic Bézier curves, filled with a single solid
alpha-blended color.  SVG primitively supports filling with multi-stop
linear RGBA gradients as well as solid RGBA colors, and if you were
going to pick a single kind of fill, gradients include solid colors as a
special case.  And linear gradients are powerful enough that you can
Gouraud-shade projected triangles with them, although I never took
advantage of that when I did that long-ago 3-D torus.</p>
<p>It may have occurred to you by now that linear gradients can also be
rendered by the prefix-sum method; it just requires two passes instead
of one.  First you fill the polygon with the ∂color/∂x of the fill
(which is constant for a linear gradient, regardless of its orientation,
until you hit a stop) using a first pass of the prefix sum; then, to
that, you add the signed edge coverages at the borders of the polygon
before doing a second pass of prefix sum.</p>
<p>I haven't yet figured out how to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12223616">do overlapping</a> alpha-blended filled
paths with this method.  Nonoverlapping paths can be done simply by
rendering all their signed edges into a single buffer before the
prefix-sum step or steps, and overlapping opaque paths can be done by
cutting holes in the paths on the bottom, removing the hidden parts of
their original edges (which nearly requires the property Levien calls
<em>extensionality</em> in his dissertation) and adding extra edges to route
them around the intruding space.  But overlapping alpha-blended paths
seem like they could be arbitrarily expensive.</p>
<p>So, I was thinking that it might be reasonable to make a UI out of
nothing but a collection of closed Bézier polylines filled with linear
RGBA gradients.  Maybe?  Texture maps would be hard to fit into that
model, and textures are pretty important, I don't know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dave Long pointed out that two overlapped alpha-blended linear
gradient regions still add up to a linear gradient:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is that really true?  After reading, I'd guess you'd calculate stops<br />
at every path vertex <em>and</em> path intersection[0].  At each stop, the<br />
color layers are known and because gradients are linear, the<br />
combination of gradients from all layers ought to also be linear.   </p>
<p>[0] these could be expensive, up to n**2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More recently, it occurs to me that there is a potential problem with
precision here, but it can be overcome.  If we want to be able to make
a linear gradient from any given 24-bit color to any other given
24-bit color across some horizontal distance, then we need to support
a change of a single count across that distance. If our intermediate
results are only 48 bits (16 bits per color plane), then the furthest
we can reach without missing is 256 pixels horizontally.  (In a sense,
the other 8 bits per pixel hold a fractional color or error
accumulator.)</p>
<p>This suggests that the optimal way to do this thing is to render
things in 256×1 chunks, with the buffer occupying 1536 bytes.
Alternatively, you could do it a scan line at a time with 32-bit ints,
which would work properly as long as the scan lines were shorter than
2²⁴ pixels, but this requires more buffer space and also runs half as
fast with optimal SIMD instructions.  For example, a 2048-pixel scan
line would require 12288 bytes of buffer space, big enough to put
serious pressure on the L1D cache.  (I’m writing this on an Atom with
a 24 KB 6-way set associative write-back L1D cache, for example.)</p>
<p>It might turn out to be work more effectively with current SIMD
instruction sets to render a band of several scan lines at a time,
because the vertical SIMD instructions have better coverage of the
available space.  For example, using AVX-512 instructions, you could
maybe handle 32 scan lines in each instruction, or maybe one color
plane for each of 10 scan lines, thus rendering a 256×10 or 256×32
band.  I think that with AVX-512 and four-way loop unrolling, the
inner loop of the critical prefix sum there will take probably 320
cycles; if it’s 256×10, that would be 8 pixels per cycle, or 4 pixels
per cycle if you do it twice.  Repainting a 2048×1536 screen that way
will take about 786432 cycles, plus whatever overhead is needed to set
up the gradient stops and copy the finished pixels into the
framebuffer and whatnot.</p>
<p>(AVX2 and AVX-512 support gather load with the VGATHERDPS, VGATHERDPD,
etc., instructions, as well as permuting stuff within a register with
VPERMPS, VPERMD, PSHUFB, etc., so copying the finished pixels into the
framebuffer might not be the horrible performance nightmare you might
expect.  AVX-512F also has scatter store.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
