(4 minutes)</div><p>Fermat conjectured that all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_numbers">Fermat numbers</a>, numbers of the form 2<em>ⁿ</em>
+ 1 where n = 2<em>ⁱ</em> for some <em>i</em> ∈ ℕ, were prime.  In fact, as far
as we know, only the first five (<em>i</em> ∈ [0, 4]) are prime, namely 3, 5,
17, 257, and 65537; Euler showed in 1732 that when <em>i</em> = 5 the number
you get, 4'294'967'297, is composite.  Fermat’s original conjecture
was <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatPrime.html">in 1650</a>, so it's sort of puzzling that it took 82 years to
disprove it.</p>
<p>In fact, you can disprove it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_Little_Theorem">Fermat’s Little Theorem</a>,
that <em>aⁿ</em> ≡ <em>a</em> (mod <em>n</em>) if <em>n</em> is prime.  Nonprime numbers <em>n</em> that
pass this primality test for every <em>a</em> are called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_numbers">Carmichael numbers</a>”
or “Fermat pseudoprimes”, and they do exist, but 4'294'967'297 happens
not to be one of them.  So, for example, when <em>n</em> = 4'294'967'297,
3<em>ⁿ</em> % <em>n</em> = 497'143'886, which is not 3.  (It does pass the test with
<em>a</em> = 2.)  This is usually a very much easier way to show that a large
number is composite than by finding its factors.</p>
<p>You could reasonably argue that Fermat didn’t have a gigaflops netbook
in his lap when he made his conjecture, and so he could hardly be
expected to go around raising numbers to such powers, but actually the
calculation is something you could do with pen and paper in a day or
two, particularly if you had a table of squares to speed you up.  You
proceed by successive squaring, dropping out a 4'294'967'297 when
necessary; each number here is the square mod <em>n</em> of the previous one:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This final result at the end would have needed to be 1; if you
multiply it by 3 mod 4'294'967'297, you get the number I gave earlier,
497'143'886, which is manifestly not 3.</p>
<p>Squaring a ten-digit number like 3'422'723'814 by hand is a
significant amount of work, though you can reduce it substantially by
looking up the first and last digits in a table of squares.  But of
course poor old Fermat couldn’t just run off the 60-page table of the
first ten thousand squares with a one-line command:</p>
<pre><code>perl -le 'print "$_² = ", $_*$_ for (1..10000)' | pr -3 | lpr
</code></pre>
<p>He might have had such a table available — people were printing books
with mathematical tables of this size around this time — but I’m
uncertain as to whether he did.  If he did, it probably contained many
errors.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_algorithm#Quarter_square_multiplication">Wikipedia suggests no such table was available until Antoine
Voisin published a table of 1000 squares in 1817</a>, although
multiplication algorithms using them have been known since ancient
Babylonia.</p>
<p>And he didn't even have Karatsuba multiplication (see <a href="../notes/karatsuba.html">Karatsuba</a>) to help him along.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (123 notes)
