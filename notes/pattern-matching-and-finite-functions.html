(14 minutes)</div><p>What if we unified function definition, pattern matching, and
dictionaries?</p>
<p>Consider this table:</p>
<pre><code>| Input | Output |
|-------+--------|
|     1 | "st"   |
|     2 | "nd"   |
</code></pre>
<p>In JS or Python, we could encode it as a hash table: <code>{1: "st", 2:
"nd"}</code>.  This has the advantage of being “just data” and therefore
easily changed, for example to add more items, and more easily
optimized, for example by using a hash table.</p>
<p>But we could also encode it as code instead of data; in JS, for
example, <code>x =&gt; x === 1 ? "st" : x === 2 ? "nd" : null</code>.  OCaml has a
syntax that allows us to encode it as code while we omit the variable
name: <code>function 1 -&gt; "st" | 2 -&gt; "nd"</code>.</p>
<p>All of these cases benefit from having a fallback:</p>
<pre><code>|   Input | Output |
|---------+--------|
|       1 | "st"   |
|       2 | "nd"   |
| (other) | "th"   |
</code></pre>
<p>In Python, we can write this, more or less, as
<code>collections.defaultdict(lambda: "th", [(1, "st"), (2, "nd")])</code>
(although <code>defaultdict</code> has a fatally bug-prone interface; you
shouldn’t use it).  As code, this function could be written in JS as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>x =&gt; x === 1 ? "st"
   : x === 2 ? "nd"
   :           "th"
</code></pre>
<p>Or, in OCaml, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>function
    1 -&gt; "st"
  | 2 -&gt; "nd"
  | _ -&gt; "th"
</code></pre>
<p>The OCaml approach works by pattern-matching the argument against each
of the “patterns”, potentially binding variables (just as in passing
arguments to a function) that can then be used in the consequent of
that pattern match.  In this case, there happen to be no variables
either on the left or the right side.</p>
<h2>Really simplified overview of type inference in OCaml</h2>
<p>OCaml does type inference to figure out what the argument type — which
is to say, the domain of the function — should be.  To simplify things
and avoid subtyping relations, normal ML type inference requires that
the domain be a known type, not some arbitrary collection of values.
Consequently, the first example above produces a warning:</p>
<pre><code># let suffix = function 1 -&gt; "st" | 2 -&gt; "nd" ;;
Characters 13-43:
  let suffix = function 1 -&gt; "st" | 2 -&gt; "nd" ;;
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
0
val suffix : int -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>However, OCaml’s type inference algorithm has been extended in ways
that do require subtyping, including “polymorphic variants” and
objects with methods.  Here’s an example with polymorphic variants:</p>
<pre><code># let rec int_of_peano = function `Z -&gt; 0 | `S(x) -&gt; 1 + int_of_peano x ;;
val int_of_peano : ([&lt; `S of 'a | `Z ] as 'a) -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# let rec peano_of_int = function 0 -&gt; `Z | n -&gt; `S (peano_of_int (n-1)) ;;
val peano_of_int : int -&gt; ([&gt; `S of 'a | `Z ] as 'a) = &lt;fun&gt;
# peano_of_int 11;;
- : [&gt; `S of 'a | `Z ] as 'a =
`S (`S (`S (`S (`S (`S (`S (`S (`S (`S (`S `Z))))))))))
# int_of_peano (`S (`S (`S (`Z)))) ;;
- : int = 3
# int_of_peano (peano_of_int 11) ;;
- : int = 11
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the return type of <code>peano_of_int</code> is not quite the same as
the argument type of <code>int_of_peano</code>:</p>
<pre><code>([&gt; `S of 'a | `Z ] as 'a)
([&lt; `S of 'a | `Z ] as 'a)
</code></pre>
<p>That’s because the argument type is an upper bound, while the return
type is a lower bound.  It’s valid to pass a value of a subtype, for
example only <code>`Z</code>, as an argument; the types don’t have to match
exactly.  Similarly, it’s valid to pass the return type into a context
that could handle some wider array of possibilities, perhaps <code>([`S of
`a | `D of `a | `Z] as a)</code> if we want to support efficient binary
representation through both successors and doublings.  But the
converse operations are not valid — we cannot pass <code>`D (`Z)</code> to
<code>int_of_peano</code>, because it will crash, and we cannot use
<code>peano_of_int</code> in a context that can only handle <code>`Z</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not just a matter of the polymorphic variant tag
matching; the type of its argument has to unify, too:</p>
<pre><code># int_of_peano(`Z (`D (`Z)));;
Characters 12-26:
  int_of_peano(`Z (`D (`Z)));;
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type [&gt; `Z of [&gt; `D of [&gt; `Z ] ] ]
       but an expression was expected of type [&lt; `S of 'a | `Z ] as 'a
       Types for tag `Z are incompatible
</code></pre>
<h2>Making it work with infix operators</h2>
<p>In OCaml, the <code>|</code> and <code>-&gt;</code> tokens are not infix operators; you cannot
make expressions with them alone.  They are part of the <code>function</code> and
<code>match</code> productions in the grammar.  But what if they were infix
operators?  What if we want the following expression to parse as
infix, work by pattern-matching, and evaluate the function outlined
above?</p>
<pre><code>  1 -&gt; "st"
| 2 -&gt; "nd"
| _ -&gt; "th"
</code></pre>
<p>Or, using operator tokens that make it look like JS or Python data:</p>
<pre><code>1: "st", 2: "nd", _: "th"
</code></pre>
<p>The first is fairly straightforward: <code>x -&gt; y</code> is, more or less, JS’s
<code>x =&gt; y</code>, a λ-abstraction.  It’s a function that takes <code>x</code> as an
argument and returns <code>y</code>, evaluated on a context augmented with
whatever names are bound in <code>x</code>.  But we kind of want it to be able to
<em>fail</em>, either at compile-time or at run-time, so that we can union <code>1
-&gt; "st"</code> with <code>2 -&gt; "nd"</code> and get <code>1 -&gt; "st" | 2 -&gt; "nd"</code>.  And, for
this kind of case, we really want the failure semantics to be
<em>ordered</em> — we don’t want to return <code>"th"</code> for everything, just
everything not otherwise covered.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the very interesting type inference question for now,
let’s consider what this gives us.  We have a single symbol here for
defining pattern-matching lambda-expressions that can fail, and a
second one that extends it to pattern-matching ordered conditionals,
which also work as dict literals.  This (plus some syntax for applying
a function to an argument) is already more than enough for Church
numerals, and so we’re already past the Turing-completeness line; but
can we make it more convenient?</p>
<p>In Perl, Python, and especially JS and Lua, it’s very common to use
dicts as general-purpose data structures.  But here our “dicts” are
functions (whose domain we perhaps have some way of computing, or at
least conservatively approximating).  Can we pattern-match on those
dicts?</p>
<p>In ES6, pattern-matching on a “dict” (called, confusingly, an
“object”) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>const {a: b, c: d, e: f} = {c: 1, e: 2, g: 3};
</code></pre>
<p>This binds the variables <code>d</code> and <code>f</code> to 1 and 2, and the value <code>b</code> to
<code>undefined</code>.  We could imagine that, given the option to declare a
failed match, the missing value for <code>a: b</code> would cause the pattern
match to fail, but the missing binding for <code>g: 3</code> would not — the
point of storing your data in dicts in the first place is so that you
can add new properties to it without breaking existing code, which is
how email headers have remained backwards-compatible for forty fucking
years.</p>
<p>If the “dict” you’re matching is a function (that can fail), this
corresponds to the pattern-match requiring it to succeed on some
finite set of arguments mentioned in the pattern.  And those semantics
are straightforward to implement, although maybe inefficient.</p>
<p>This means that to try to invoke a function, you’re taking the
function that is its argument and trying to invoke it (possibly
several times) with the keys in the argument pattern.  This sounds
like it’s going to be an infinite regress, but presumably at some
point you will bottom out in symbols and other atoms, which, say,
cannot be invoked as functions.</p>
<p>If we try to keep our syntactic noise to a minimum, we could declare
that lowercase barewords are symbols and variables need uppercase (as
in Erlang), use the <code>:</code> and <code>,</code> symbols from Python/JS instead of <code>-&gt;</code>
and <code>|</code>, and use the infix-syntax and
function-application-by-juxtaposition syntax from OCaml.  So then our
<code>peano_of_int</code> function ends up as:</p>
<pre><code>Peano_of_int = 0: z, N: (s: Peano_of_int (N-1));
</code></pre>
<p>And then its counterpart should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Int_of_peano = z: 0, (s: N): 1 + Int_of_peano N;
</code></pre>
<p>And the example we started with would be written:</p>
<pre><code>1: "st", 2: "nd", _: "th"
</code></pre>
<h2>Arguments first!</h2>
<p>At this point, we start to want local variables or let-expressions.</p>
<p>But let-expressions are just, in some sense, syntactic sugar to paper
over the unfortunate fact that in <code>(λx.some long thing involving x)3</code>,
the <code>x</code> argument and the <code>3</code> are spatially far apart, and we want them
to be close together.  That is, we have the order <code>x Y 3</code>, and we want
<code>x</code> and <code>3</code> to be adjacent.  Of the six possible orderings of the
three items, only <code>x Y 3</code> and <code>3 Y x</code> do not have them adjacent, and
<code>let</code> rewrites that to <code>x 3 Y</code>, omitting the literal tokens.</p>
<p>But there are three other orderings that would also solve the problem,
which are <code>Y x 3</code>, <code>Y 3 x</code> and <code>3 x Y</code>.  Since <code>Y</code> is an expression
written in terms of <code>x</code>, it’s desirable for readability for <code>x</code> to
precede it and be adjacent to it, so <code>3 x Y</code> would perhaps be the
clearest order.</p>
<p>Which is to say, perhaps arguments should precede functions in a
function application expression, as, in a sense, in the ς-calculus and
other object-oriented languages — even though, in this case, the
functions are first-class values rather than merely selectors.</p>
<p>This leads us to write our examples above as follows, with a needless
Dijkstra-like <code>.</code> introduced to improve familiarity:</p>
<pre><code>Int_to_peano = 0: z, N: (s: (N-1).Int_to_peano);
Peano_to_int = z: 0, (s: N): 1 + N.Peano_to_int;
</code></pre>
<p>This pants-on-head syntax now gives us the sugar to avoid
let-expressions in programs like this:</p>
<pre><code>Sort = nil: nil,
    (car: P, cdr: Xs):
        Xs.(P.Lt.Filter).(Lesser:
        Xs.(P.Ge.Filter).(Greater:
        Lesser.Sort.((car: P, cdr: Greater.Sort).Append)));

Filter = F: (nil: nil,
             (car: X, cdr: Xs): X.F.(true: (car: X, cdr: Xs.F.Filter),
                                     false: Xs.F.Filter));

Append = nil: (Ys: Ys),
         (car: X, cdr: Xs): (Ys: (car: X, cdr: Xs.Ys.Append));
</code></pre>
<p>Here my <code>Filter</code> and <code>Append</code> functions are curried, and I’m presuming
that <code>Lt</code> and <code>Ge</code> are curried primitives such that, for example,
<code>4.Lt</code> evaluates to a function that returns <code>true</code> for arguments that
are less than 4.</p>
<p>If you could arrange for the <code>X/Xs</code> destructuring pattern-match to
fail in <code>Filter</code> when <code>X.F</code> doesn’t return <code>true</code>, maybe you could get
a cleaner program.  I am not clear that there is a way to do that
within the semantics I have described.</p>
<p>If we wanted it to be more Prolog-like, we could use <code>;</code> instead of
<code>,</code>; to be less Prolog-like, we could interchange the sense of upper
and lower case, or use Ruby-like prefix colons for literal symbols
instead of case, or interchange <code>=</code> and <code>:</code>.  And we could potentially
dispense with the <code>.</code> for function application.  Four of the 11 other
possibilities arising thus:</p>
<pre><code>sort = Nil: Nil,
    (Car: p, Cdr: xs):
        xs (p lt filter) (lesser:
        xs (p ge filter) (greater:
        lesser sort ((Car: p, Cdr: greater sort) append)));

Sort = nil: nil;
    (car: P; cdr: Xs):
        Xs.(P.Lt.Filter).(Lesser:
        Xs.(P.Ge.Filter).(Greater:
        Lesser.Sort.((car: P; cdr: Greater.Sort).Append)))

sort: Nil=Nil;
    (Car=p; Cdr=xs):
        xs (p lt filter) (lesser:
        xs (p ge filter) (greater:
        lesser sort ((Car=p; Cdr = greater sort) append)));

sort = :nil: :nil,
    (:car: p, :cdr: xs):
        xs.(p.lt.filter).(lesser:
        xs.(p.ge.filter).(greater:
        lesser.sort.((:car: p, :cdr: greater.sort).append)));
</code></pre>
<p>Yeesh, that last one looks unparseable.</p>
<p>Raph Levien’s Io language used, approximately, <code>-&gt;</code> and a
right-associative <code>;</code> where I am using <code>.(</code> and <code>:</code>, thus avoiding the
pileup of right parentheses at the end.  If we tried that approach and
terminated each alternative in the pattern match with <code>.</code> (that being
the only symbol whose precedence in prose is lower than <code>;</code>), we might
end up with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>sort = Nil; Nil.
    (Car; p. Cdr; xs);
        xs -&gt; (p -&gt; lt -&gt; filter) -&gt; lesser;
        xs -&gt; (p -&gt; ge -&gt; filter) -&gt; greater;
        lesser -&gt; sort -&gt; ((Car; p. Cdr; greater -&gt; sort) -&gt; append.
</code></pre>
<p>This does not seem more readable to me.</p>
<h2>Backtracking, generators, and binary relations</h2>
<p>All of the above is predicated on the idea that a function produces at
most one value — so, for example, <code>_ -&gt; "a" | _ -&gt; "b"</code> will never
return "b" because the first match will never fail.  But a natural
extension of the approach is to allow any expression to yield any
number of values, as in Icon, rather than just zero or one.  (Partly
by coincidence, Icon uses <code>|</code> to do something closely analogous to
chaining together cases of a pattern-match.)</p>
<p>This, in effect, means that we are no longer talking about functions;
we are talking about binary relations.  With an order imposed on their
pairs, perhaps.</p>
<p>There is a rather nice algebra of binary relations; they form a
lattice (considering them as sets of (input, output) pairs with the
usual set operations), a monoid (under composition), and they have a
nontrivial isomorphism — the converse or inverse, which, unlike
function inverses, is defined for all binary relations.</p>
<p>One approach to programming with general binary relations would be to
attempt a binary-relation-based pattern-matching version of
miniKANREN, abandoning the ordering of the possibilities.  And that
would be cool.</p>
<p>Another approach would be to follow Icon (and Python and JS) in using
these generators for iteration.  Io does this using no new operations,
just a little bit of syntactic sugar for continuations.  Python, JS,
and Icon do not allow multi-shot continuations; Python and JS, like
Io, reify the suspended generator, while Icon usually does not,
instead identifying the generator with the expression.  I’m not sure
how many operations you really need to control the backtracking, but
there are at least two: one that prevents further backtracking
(Prolog’s cut) and one that backtracks repeatedly until no further
backtracking is possible, then continues.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
