<p>Graphviz has this really clever way to handle layouts inside nodes of
shape “record”.  Fields are separated by “|”, and by default are laid
out left to right; within “{}” the default layout is transposed, top
to bottom instead.  So “A|{B|C}|D”, for example, is a three-column
layout with two rows, B and C, in the middle column.  Hboxes nest
inside vboxes; vboxes nest inside hboxes.</p>
<p>There are some other details, and now this is sort of deprecated in
favor of a subset of HTML they’re implementing.  But I think the
“|”-separation layout is brilliant, and can be extended in interesting
ways.</p>
<h2>First modification: use friendlier characters “[,]'\n”, and vertical by default</h2>
<p>Instead of “{|}”, which are optimized for not occurring by accident,
and “\” to escape them, let’s use “[,]” for nesting and separators,
and “'” for quoting, as in Lisp.  So “65,535” is written as “65',535”.
All of these characters are easily reachable on a standard QWERTY
keyboard without shift or extreme reaches.</p>
<p>Let’s make the top level of nesting be vertical by default, rather
than Graphviz’s horizontal.</p>
<p>Also, let’s add newline as a shorthand for “],[“.  This allows us to
write this table</p>
<pre><code>| a | b | c |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
</code></pre>
<p>as</p>
<pre><code>[a,b,c
1,2,3]
</code></pre>
<p>rather than “[a,b,c],[1,2,3]”.</p>
<p>XXX maybe this should be reversed in some way?  Gotta think about
that.</p>
<p>I was thinking that maybe the quote or escape character should be “/”
and should follow the character being quoted, but I think that’s
probably bad in that it involves arbitrary lookahead to see if a
sequence of escape characters is going to be even or odd and thus
determine whether it quotes the character before it or not.</p>
<h2>Second modification: table layout</h2>
<p>Let’s establish the rule that sequences of sibling nested boxes, like
the hboxes “a,b,c” and “1,2,3” in the previous example, have aligned
fields, so they lay out as a table.  If there is an intervening
sibling box with no nesting, that terminates the table.</p>
<p>To soften this, let’s add boxes whose content is merely “continuation
of box to the left” and “continuation of box above”.  For these we can
use “&gt;” and “^” respectively rather than “,”, so that this table</p>
<pre><code>procs -----------------------memory---------------------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- --------cpu--------
 r  b         swpd         free         buff        cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs  us  sy  id  wa  st
 1  0            0      1738140       120936      1405284    0    0    22    14   55  961   2   2  97   0   0
 0  0            0      1737876       120936      1405292    0    0     0     0 1117 1180   1   2  97   0   0
</code></pre>
<p>can instead be written as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[procs&gt;,memory&gt;&gt;&gt;,swap&gt;,io&gt;,system&gt;,cpu&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
r,b,swpd,free,buff,cache,si,so,bi,bo,in,cs,us,sy,id,wa,st
1,0,0,1738140,120936,1405284,0,0,22,14,55,961,2,2,97,0,0
0,0,0,1737876,120936,1405292,0,0,0,0,1117,1180,1,2,97,0,0]
</code></pre>
<p>This provides substantial layout power and is actually easier to use
than fixed-width ASCII table layout, as far as it goes.</p>
<p>If you actually want hboxes vertically adjacent to one another not to
share columns, you can add extra levels of nesting:
“[[[a long name,b,c]]],[[[1,2,3 million tons]]]”.</p>
<p>XXX the following part is half-baked.</p>
<p>As a possible modification of this to support outline-type structures,
you could maybe allow a nested box with fewer cells to partially
terminate a table structure.  Take this example:</p>
<pre><code>[+,usr&gt;
,+,local&gt;
,,+,bin&gt;
,,,,ncftp
,+,bin&gt;
,,,bash]
</code></pre>
<p>Here the first line has three cells (the third of which is merged with
the second), while the fourth line has five (the first four of which
are empty).  The next line has only four cells again, so the boundary
between the fourth and fifth cell on the previous line is forgotten.</p>
<h2>Third modification: hashtags</h2>
<p>To identify particular cells or classes of cells, we can insert
hashtags into them which are not displayed by default.  Perhaps
“[a #th,b #th,c #th #ch],[1,2,3]” tags all three of a, b, and c with “th”,
but only c is tagged with “ch”, identifying it uniquely.  You can put
the hashtags anywhere in the cell; at the beginning or the end,
separating whitespace will be removed.</p>
<p>There are at least five kinds of things you might want to do with
hashtags: style cells, set or append to cell contents, link to cell
contents, read cell contents, and listen for user interaction in
cells.  All of these might query hashtags (or contents!) in the cell
itself, in its ancestors, in its siblings, or in other cells aligned
with it.  In a syntax for these, we need three or five directional
indicators, plus some way to indicate whether we mean an immediate
neighbor or an eventual one.</p>
<p>For example, you might use “&gt;” to indicate an immediately preceding
sibling node, “&gt;*” to indicate any sibling node, “/” (or maybe “.”)
to indicate an immediate parent node, “/*” to indicate any ancestor
node, “^” to indicate a corresponding node in the second dimension of
the table (such as a column), and “^*” to indicate a previous node.
So perhaps “th” indicates a cell tagged “th”, “ch” indicates the cell
tagged ch, “ch^” indicates the cell below the cell tagged ch, “ch^^”
indicates the cell two below it, “ch^*” indicates the entire column,
and “ch^* sydney&gt;*” indicates any cell in any column containing the
“ch” hashtag and any row containing the “sydney” hashtag.  (Or vice
versa if the table is laid out in columns?  Bleh.  Also maybe one of
these operators should be postfix and you should be able to stick them
before or after the hashtag.)</p>
<p>As an alternative to identifying cells with hashtags, you can identify
them with search strings with "?string?" or maybe regexps.</p>
<p>Of course there are other kinds of things than hashtags you might want
to put into cells and not show up as pure text: sparklines, progress
bars, character-level markup, URLs to link to, raster and vector
images, and so on.</p>
<p>You could use cursor movement commands as an alternative to hashtags
as a way to identify text to modify.</p>
<h2>Cheap in-memory representation</h2>
<p>It would be nice if we could represent a node unambiguously as a
pointer into the string representation (or <em>some</em> string
representation), which would require that each tree node has a unique
first byte in that string representation.  We might have to make some
minimal changes.  Consider again “[a,b,c;1,2,3]”, which is a vbox
containing two hboxes which each contain three leaf cells.  If we
expand this to have a unique root node and expand out the “;”, it
becomes “[[a,b,c],[1,2,3]]”, and now each node indeed has a unique
first byte.  Also, the commas and “]”s are not the first byte of any
node, so expanding out the “;” was unnecessary; “[[a,b,c;1,2,3]]” is
adequate.  This gives us a 15-byte representation of the whole tree,
although proceeding from one sibling node to the next may be somewhat
slow.  (A cache for large jumps could limit this problem.)</p>
<p>Compare this to a Lisp-style or C-style record-and-pointer
representation:</p>
<pre><code>digraph abc123 {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=record];
    subgraph rows {node [label="{count|3}|&lt;0&gt;|&lt;1&gt;|&lt;2&gt;"]; row0 row1;}
    root [label="{count|2}|&lt;0&gt;|&lt;1&gt;"];
    root:0 -&gt; row0; root:1 -&gt; row1;
    row0:0 -&gt; a; row0:1 -&gt; b; row0:2 -&gt; c;
    row1:0 -&gt; 1; row1:1 -&gt; 2; row1:2 -&gt; 3;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just the internal nodes of this tree take up 11 pointers of storage,
typically 4 bytes each nowadays, and that’s not even counting the leaf
nodes that contain the labels.  If you make linked lists of siblings
you can ditch the count fields, but then you pay even more in
next-sibling pointers:</p>
<pre><code>digraph abc123 {
    node [shape=record];
    subgraph i {node [label="&lt;k&gt;kids|&lt;n&gt;next"]; d e f g h i j k;}
    d:k -&gt; e:k -&gt; a;        e:n -&gt; f:k -&gt; b; f:n -&gt; g:k -&gt; c;
    d:n -&gt; h:k -&gt; i:k -&gt; 1; i:n -&gt; j:k -&gt; 2; j:n -&gt; k:k -&gt; 3;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This has 16 pointers instead of only 11, because it needs 8
next-sibling pointers (two of which are null) instead of 3 count
fields.</p>
<h2>A friendlier syntax variant with more special cases</h2>
<p>Suppose the top-level separator is “\n” and if there’s a “\t” it gets
inferred as a second-level separator, and we use “{}” for further
nesting.  Then we can ingest tab-separated values (with some strange
quoting conventions) natively, without losing the power of nesting.
The main disadvantage is that it’s much more irregular, and there are
lots of cases where a level of nesting can fail to be inferred because
there’s only one item.</p>
<h2>Some failed ideas</h2>
<p>ASCII has separate horizontal and vertical separators: HT and VT (^K).
Suppose you adopt the rule that you infer a surrounding hbox when you
find an HT, and a surrounding vbox when you find a VT.  Then maybe you
could infer all your hboxes and vboxes instead of having to mark their
beginnings explicitly, and then you would be winning because you would
only have to mark the endings, with some third control character, like
LF, which would end the current hbox or vbox.  For example, given this
text:</p>
<pre><code>a   b   c
d   e   f
</code></pre>
<p>which is to say, <code>a&lt;HT&gt;b&lt;HT&gt;c&lt;LF&gt;d&lt;HT&gt;e&lt;HT&gt;f&lt;LF&gt;</code>, you would infer an
hbox upon finding the HT after “a”, and then pack “a”, “b”, and “c”
into it, and then end the inferred hbox upon finding the LF.  Then
upon finding the HT after “d”, you would infer a new hbox (and perhaps
a vbox to contain it and the previous hbox).  The idea was that you
would never infer an <em>end</em> to any current box; they would all be
explicit.</p>
<p>This doesn’t work for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can put a vbox as the second field of an hbox with a sequence
  like <code>a&lt;HT&gt;b&lt;VT&gt;c</code>, but never as the first, because you haven’t
  inferred the hbox yet.  So the <code>&lt;VT&gt;</code> will be treated as a separator
  for the surrounding vbox.</li>
<li>It’s too easy to accidentally end the outer vbox.  For example,
  <code>a&lt;HT&gt;b&lt;LF&gt;c&lt;LF&gt;</code> would end it, because no <code>&lt;HT&gt;</code> has yet been seen
  to infer an hbox to pack the <code>c</code> into.  To be consistent, if more
  text followed, you’d want to infer an outer wrapping hbox
  surrounding that vbox, and so on.</li>
<li>You can’t have a box with only one child.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also thought about using a stack machine model: first you output
some boxes separated by separator bytes, and then you combine them by
emitting some combining bytes that will join them into hboxes and
vboxes.  This has most of the same problems and additionally makes
text hard to edit.</p>
<h2>Some better ideas</h2>
<p>It’s probably best to stick to LF as the separator.  Then, what do we
use for group start and group end codes?  Nonprintable characters
would be nice.  ASCII-1967 has STX and ETX, ^B and ^C, which sound
promising, but STX is really EOH (end of header).  And ^C has acquired
the meanings of killing processes or copying text, either of which
would be unfortunate to invoke accidentally.  ^R and ^T (DC2 and DC4)
would work; they used to turn your paper tape punch on and off.  SO
and SI (^N and ^O) would also work; on VT100s they select the
graphical character set, which is a nicely parallel meaning, although
they don’t nest there.</p>
<p>ECMA-48 defines a variety of opening delimiters in whose closing
delimiter is ST, String Terminator, 0x9c; specifically APC
(application program command, 0x9f), DCS (device control string,
0x90), OSC (operating system command, 0x9d), PM (privacy message,
0x9e), and SOS (start of string, 0x98).  Nesting is explicitly
forbidden; according to the spec, most of the strings need to be
printable ASCII, not even printable ISO-8859-1.  There are also PU1
and PU2 codes, 0x91 and 0x92.  These are all in the little-used C1
control codes area of ISO-8859-1 (originally ANSI X3.64), which
Windows-1252 repurposed for characters that are more commonly used.</p>
<p>So our table might look like
<code>&lt;DC2&gt;a&lt;LF&gt;b&lt;LF&gt;c&lt;DC4&gt;&lt;DC2&gt;1&lt;LF&gt;2&lt;LF&gt;3&lt;DC4&gt;</code>.  This is kind of
suboptimal in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>as I said before, it’s more bytes than the usual CSV;</li>
<li>with the unprintable delimiters, if rendered by a traditional
  terminal, it’s actually even more misleading than before, because
  “c1” appears as a single line.  Maybe it would work better to use CR
  (^M) and VT (^K), which xterm, konsole, libvte display as if it were
  ^J.</li>
<li>if you’re editing it byte by byte, if you delete either the opening
  or closing delimiter in the middle, you will get a change of
  orientation of the text, which could be confusing.  Or maybe useful
  if you actually wanted to transpose a table, I guess, but it also
  transposes all the subtables.  Worse, though, all the text
  afterwards will change orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>A possible further alternative would be to determine box type by its
internal delimiters (^I vs. ^J), but still have separate nesting
delimiters (^K and ^M, say).  Then you could go one step closer to
regular terminal ASCII interpretation by inferring (only) hboxes
within vboxes when necessary to handle ^I and ^J occurring within the
same container.  This requires four characters instead of three, but
eliminates all the other problems previously mentioned.</p>
<p>You still have the problem of unmatched delimiters swallowing the rest
of the document, at least temporarily, when they’re inserted in the
middle.  There must be some kind of possible solution to that but I
don’t know what it is.  Maybe eliminating arbitrary nesting entirely
and switching to transclusion of named chunks (maybe with Knuth-style
1f, 1b labels) for nesting?  Sigh.</p>
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<p>The most obvious use case is a human being interactively preparing a
two-dimensional nested layout of text for another human being to read,
and I think this approach (supplemented with a few restructuring
commands) is probably superior to anything I’ve seen for that purpose.</p>
<p>The second most obvious case is to produce human-readable output from
a computer program.  This syntax provides an easy way for program
output to be tabular, nested, and semantically tagged for styling.</p>
<p>You might also want to use that semantic tagging for data extraction
and to specify additional transformations to make.</p>
<p>The layout algorithm for this format is not quite as simple and fast
as the layout algorithm for fixed-width ASCII text, but it’s
dramatically simpler and faster than the CSS box model, especially if
you don’t do word wrap.</p>
<p>You also might want to use this data model for parsing data from other
sources — HTML tables, spreadsheets, discussion threads, XML files,
JSON, relational databases, that kind of thing.</p>
<h2>Implementing a prototype</h2>
<p>What would it take to get a prototype of this thing running so I can
see what it feels like to type into it?  Probably the easiest
substrate available is DHTML, and although part of my motivation is to
have something that reliably lays out and redisplays faster than DHTML
does, maybe a DHTML prototype would be adequate.</p>
<p>Given that desire, though, it seems like I’ll still have to use JS to
do all the computations.  In a situation like {{A|B}|{C|D}}|{E|F}, we
have to satisfy the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>{E|F} is below the ABCD row.</li>
<li>{E|F} is the same width as the ABCD row.</li>
<li>E is the same width as {A|B}</li>
<li>F is the same width as {C|D}.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far so good — that’s just a 2×2 table.  But there’s more:</p>
<ul>
<li>{A|B} is to the left of {C|D}.</li>
<li>A is the same height as C.</li>
<li>B is the same height as D.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, that’s okay; it’s just turned our 2×2 table into a 2×3 table.
But there are cases where it’s essential to not have certain
constraints that would flow from treating the whole thing as just one
big table.  For example, if you replace A|B with {{A|B}}, the
constraint with {C|D} goes away.  Maybe you can still use rowspan and
colspan with nested tables to get this effect, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that each level of nesting has its own
parallel cell constraints to deal with.  If a table like
{a|b|c}|{d|e|f}|{g|h|i} is in a cell that has sibling cells, the
table’s own rows (or columns) may be subject to alignment constraints
with the contents of those sibling cells — but only to that one level,
as the individual cells within those rows or columns will not be.</p>
<p>I still feel that the whole thing can still be pretty much done with
two passes: one pass to figure out which heights and widths have to be
equal, and a second bottom-up pass to calculate them.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s fairly simple.  If we just do nesting, without tables, each
minimum width is either a constant, for text boxes; the maximum of
some other widths, for a vbox; or a sum of other widths, for an hbox.
These minimum widths are strictly arranged in a tree.  (A
corresponding, parallel, and independent tree is present for heights.)
So the minwidth of each hbox is a sum of maxima of minwidths of hboxes
(or text boxes).  If we switch to strict tables, instead, the minwidth
of a column is a maximum of sums of minwidths of vboxes.  I think this
will be simple but I still don’t have it entirely clear in my mind.</p>
<p>Ragged tables, where different rows or columns have different numbers
of items, and so, for example, a column may only affect certain rows
of a table, seem like they will be more complexity.</p>
<p>We can compile the layout into a tree of data dependencies: the
minwidth of a column is the maximum minwidth of its cells; the
minwidth of a table is the sum of the minwidths of its columns; and so
on.  Ragged tables make the topology more complicated because the
minwidth of the table may come from a row which may actually have a
contribution from the actual width of one of its cells that is imposed
by the minwidth of a cell in a different row, while that row may have
fewer cells and thus not actually impose its own row-minwidth on the
table as a whole; I don’t know if there’s a way to ensure that the
dependencies in that case are noncircular, but I suspect so.</p>
<p>Other approaches to the layout problem include, of course the CSS box
model, and TeX’s boxes-and-glue model, in which each character is a
box, hboxes line up vboxes or vrules or characters on a baseline, and
vboxes string together hboxes; TeX flows the text into a bunch of
hboxes of length <code>\hsize</code>.  Glue has nine-dimensional flexibility: a
default size, a maximum shrink, a maximum stretch, and then three more
optional transfinite levels of maximum shrinks and stretches.  This
allows space between words to be flexible, but not take advantage of
that flexibility when you want to, say, center a line with equal
infinite stretches on both left and right.</p>
<h2>Quasi-unrelated: escape sequence tags</h2>
<p>How do you specify things like font size, borders, padding, and the
like?  The standard ASCII approach is using escape sequences, but
those have some big problems; they involve a mode switch, and so as
you’re typing them (or receiving them) you can’t see what’s going on.
And if there’s an interrupted transmission, they can eat some
following text.</p>
<p>The org-mode approach to handling links is kind of nice.  If you type
<code>[[http://x.org/][foo]</code>, it’s just text; but once you add a final <code>]</code>,
it just displays as <code>foo</code> with underlines, and it’s a link.  Movement
commands skip the hidden characters, but if you delete one of them,
the pattern breaks and the remainder becomes visible.</p>
<p>WordPerfect’s Alt-F3 “Reveal Codes” screen was one of its most
distinctive features.  It displayed boldfaced escape sequences like
[HRt] for a paragraph break (“hard return”), [UND] and [und] for
beginning and ending underlines, [Just:Left] for a beginning of
left-justification, and so on.  But this didn’t provide any clue as to
how you would go about typing them.  The current “WordPerfect” product
still has such a feature, but now it draws little tags around the
“codes”.</p>
<p>HTML tags are nice but require a WordPerfect-like mode switch to make
them effective.</p>
<p>So here’s a thought.  If we’re going to have inline markup, maybe
instead of <em>preceding</em> an escape sequence with an escape character, we
should <em>follow</em> it.  Maybe you write <code>just:left</code> or <code>border:black</code> or
<code>href:http://x.org/</code> or <code>18pt</code> or <code>sparkline:3,5,1,18,12,19</code> in your
document and then add a ^] (GS, group separator) to interpret the text
back to and including the previous whitespace as an “escape sequence”,
thus removing it from view.  This solves most of the problems of
escape sequences and provides a sort of command line; it also allows a
sort of immediate feedback as you’re typing the escape sequence or
receiving it, and it’s harmless if the escape sequence is truncated.
The choice of whitespace as the other delimiter ensures that a
corrupted escape sequence can’t eat too much text.  If you’re
receiving data really slowly then you will have transient mysterious
text appearing on the screen but that’s hardly the worst display
problem resulting from slow data reception.</p>
<h2>Cursor positioning escape sequences</h2>
<p>The best way for software to position the cursor in such a terminal,
aside from cursor forward and back, is probably with escape sequences
to push, pop, search, and move-to-end.  Then you can insert text by
sending it, or delete text with the DEL character, say.</p>
<h2>Simplifying by dropping row/column transposition</h2>
<p>All of the above ideas are complicated by the conflicting desires to
support HT as an unambiguously horizontal separator and LF as an
unambiguously vertical separator, on one hand, and on the other to
conceptually have only three kinds of delimiter <code>{|}</code>; and also to
simply be made of nested hboxes and boxes, on one hand, and on the
other to support tabular layout.</p>
<p>Suppose that we resign ourselves to having four kinds of delimiter
instead of three, and to making things out of nested tables instead of
nested boxes.  Let’s say our tables do use HT and LF as horizontal and
vertical separators, respectively, and we use two other characters for
table nesting; let’s say DC2 and DC4, ^R and ^T.  The requested height
of a table is the sum of the requested heights of its rows, and the
requested height of a row is the maximum of the requested heights of
its cells, and <em>mutatis mutandis</em> for width and columns.  In a very
simple model where cells can only contain either a table or a string,
the width and height of the cell is just the width and height of the
table or of the string; if a cell can contain a sequence of characters
and tables in some way, then we need some kind of layout rule; several
adequate possibilities occur to me.</p>
<p>(VT, ^K, and FF, ^L, are obvious choices for table <em>separators</em> but
not so obvious for table beginner-and-enders — should they begin
nested tables, terminate them, or begin one and start a sibling?
Perhaps better to use characters without so much baggage.)</p>
<p>This seems like it will be simpler to implement and to use, at least
until we add rowspan and colspan and partial termination back in.</p>
<p>With these rules, there is the possibility that table cells receive a
size that is different from what they requested, at least by being
larger in either or both dimensions, and there are a variety of
options as to how to handle that: left/top alignment, right/bottom
alignment, centering, and stretching.  You could extend this principle
to the top-level document as well, enabling it to fill a larger window
than it has explicitly requested.</p>
<p>A trickier question is how to handle canvases that are <em>smaller</em> than
requested, for example to fit the entire canvas on the screen or to
fit a column or row of the table into that entire canvas.  The CSS2
<code>overflow</code> options here are <code>visible</code> (like T<sub>E</sub>X with
overfull hboxes), <code>hidden</code> (discard, mostly like a terminal with
line-wrap turned off), <code>scroll</code> (display scrollbars), and <code>auto</code>
(which is <code>scroll</code> but hides the scrollbars when unnecessary); to this
CSS3 (I think) adds <code>unset</code>.  But this omits the choice of whether and
how to do line-wrapping, which in CSS is socked away in the
<code>white-space</code> and <code>hyphens</code> properties, and doesn’t offer the
traditional terminal option of wrapping per character rather than per
word.  An additional option used in, for example, Android’s keyboard
autocomplete suggestions, is to squish or stretch the contents on the
relevant axis, to fill the box (such approaches to filling lines,
impossible in the hot-lead era, are sometimes called
“microtypography”), and the obvious other alternative is to repeat it,
as in dot leaders for tables of contents.</p>
<p>(HTML layout doesn’t normally deal with a <em>vertical</em> box becoming
full, but this is a thing we might want in order to take advantage of
modern big displays with multicolumn layouts, and it’s necessary for
rendering to paper.)</p>
<p>The usual way to handle overflow in ASCII terminal applications is to
rely on applications that painted the screen to insert hard line
breaks and extra spaces to wrap and justify paragraphs as desired,
which clearly has drawbacks when you’re using ASCII as a document
format rather than an interactive screen-painting protocol, and
accounts for the near-unreadability of most ASCII text documents on
modern hand computers.  So, having overflow-handling options would be
pretty useful.</p>
<p>In particular, being able to flow table rows from the bottom of one
page onto the top of another is pretty important.</p>
<p>T<sub>E</sub>X glue has a three-level stretchiness hierarchy — any
amount of elasticity at a higher level of the hierarchy is infinite as
seen from any lower level — and also separate stretchiness and
shrinkiness quantities at each of these levels.  Despite this level of
complexity (I hesitate to say “expressiveness”) the layout engine,
except for paragraph filling, is a simple solver of a system of linear
equations.  (Not to undersell that — closed-form linear solvers use
things like QR factorization which take O(N³) time, while iterative
linear-solver algorithms like successive over-relaxation, though only
O(N²), have complicated convergence characteristics.)</p>
<p>A remaining lacuna is how to handle ragged tables; above I suggested
that each column should end when it reaches a row that doesn’t contain
a cell for it, but perhaps there should be a special case that ends
all the columns when there’s a blank line (without even a space).
Without such a special case, there’s no way to end the first column
other than ending the entire table with, perhaps, an additional ^T.
The result would be that single-column lines of text would either tend
to be outrageously squished by other columns, or would push those
other columns over outrageously, even if they occurred far earlier in
the text.</p>
<h3>Layout properties</h3>
<p>T<sub>E</sub>X has a zillion layout properties it stores in
“registers”, which are automatically restored to their previous value
on the exit from the nesting level where they were defined.  CSS does
something similar: most properties are inherited from the parent node
if they are not locally overridden, but properties set in a child node
never bubble up to a parent node, much less just the part of the
parent node following the child node.  This is considerably saner than
the approach that results implicitly from the state-machine model
described by ANSI escape sequences and their more diverse
predecessors.</p>
<p>Traditional terminals quantize layout and colors to character-cell
boundaries, as well as abjuring texture and quantizing colors to a
small number of primary or near-primary colors, with aesthetically
unpleasant results.  (You could argue that <em>traditional</em> terminals are
black-and-white, or print on paper, but those aren’t the ones we
emulate nowadays.)  On a bitmapped screen, just as on a
phototypesetter, there’s no need to quantize in this way, and on
modern computers, even quantizing coordinates to pixels is no longer a
problem.  (Many computers nowadays have screens near 300 dpi, or 900
dpi horizontally with subpixel rendering, and antialiasing
subpixel-positioned text is no longer the performance nightmare it
once was.)</p>
<p>From HTML we know that a little bit of extra space around text before
running into a color change can make an enormous difference to
readability and aesthetics.  Compare <i style="display: inline-block;
color: white; background-color: black">this, with no padding,</i> to
<i style="display: inline-block; color: white; background-color:
black; padding: 0.2em">this, with 0.2em padding.</i> (As of this
writing, the ET Book font I’m using has substantial extra
leading (vertical blank space) built into it, which shows up as
built-in “padding” above and below, and building extra leading and
letter spacing into your font in this way may be a reasonable hack to
improve appearance in these situations.)  Similarly, when text is
<span style="color: #966">highlighted in</span>
<span style="color: #99c" >pastel colors</span>, it’s more readable
and less visually noisy than when it’s <span style="color:
red">highlighted in</span> <span style="color: blue">primary
colors</span>.  And a <span style="background-color: #fef; padding:
3px">pastel background box</span> is much more clearly visible <span
style="background-color: #fef; padding: 2px; border: solid
1px #dcd">with a thin border of the same color, but slightly
darker</span>.</p>
<p>In less Tufte-approved and more brochure-like directions, <span
style="text-shadow: .1em .1em .05em rgba(0,0,0,.2)">text drop
shadows</span> and <span style="padding: .2em; background-image:
linear-gradient(rgba(255,255,255,.1) 0, rgba(0,0,0,.1))">background
gradients</span> are also often nice-looking effects, especially when
used as accents rather than for running text, or on top of a visually
noisy or poorly contrasting background that could interfere with text
readability.  Consider the difficulty of reading <span style="padding:
.2em; background-image: linear-gradient(red 0, green 50%, black)">this
problematic background</span> and <span style="padding: .2em;
background-image: linear-gradient(red 0, green 50%, black);
text-shadow: 0 0 .2em #fff, 0 0 .2em #fff, 0 0 .3em #fff">the same
problematic background but with text-shadow</span>, and then consider
that problematic backgrounds can come from data plots, 3-D renderings,
or photographs as well as poorly chosen static gradients.</p>
<p>Supporting all of these in a general-purpose layout syntax would be
entirely reasonable, even without the complexities of the HTML box
model.  You could quite reasonably have escape sequences that set such
properties for the current table or (for character-level markup) for
the span of text following the escape sequence, without importing all
the complexities of the CSS box model and text-flow algorithms.</p>
<h2>Page/column breaks and tables</h2>
<p>On 2019-09-01, dpk commented on #swhack about the limitations of LaTeX
tables; reformatted from IRC style, she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This combination of things in LaTeX is annoyingly apparently
  impossible: multiple-column mode; tables spanning multiple
  pages/columns; groups of rows within said table which should not be
  broken apart --- oh, and header rows on the said table which repeat
  after every column/page break.</p>
<p><code>tabular</code> (built-in) can’t break across multiple pages or columns at
  all, so you try the <code>longtable</code> package.  First thing <code>longtable</code>
  does is complain that it doesn’t work in multi-column mode, whether
  from the <code>multicol</code> package or with the built-in <code>\twocolumn</code>.</p>
<p>Some page recommends <code>supertabular</code>, which is apparently the
  predecessor to <code>longtable</code> but does work in multi-column mode,
  because why not remove features from things!  <code>supertabular</code> seems
  to work, but then you notice you have groups of rows in the table
  (pairs, in my case) that really need to be on the same page/in the
  same column as one another, no matter what. <code>supertabular</code> doesn’t
  appear to support this.</p>
<p>But, oh look, there’s this package that lets you use the <code>\\*</code>
  command instead of <code>\\</code> to insert a row break that isn’t allowed to
  cross a page or column break. the package is ... <code>longtable</code>.  Which
  you can’t use.</p>
<p>Then you discover there’s a hack to make <code>longtable</code> work in
  multi-column mode, ... but it doesn’t support printing the headers
  of the table anew at the top of each new column.</p>
<p>So, TL;DR, I am very annoyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This combination of requirements is probably a good one to keep in
mind for designing table-layout systems, since evidently it’s a
combination of features that is difficult to provide if you didn’t
plan for it from the beginning.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/graphics.html">Graphics</a> (91 notes)
