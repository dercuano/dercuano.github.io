(2 minutes)</div><p>I’d like to add full-text search to Dercuano; God knows I grep it
often enough.  Right now I have 4.5 megs of Markdown in 341 notes,
producing a 2.0-megabyte gzipped tar file with static HTML files (plus
tables of contents), and I'm planning to expand these numbers by a
factor of about 2.5 by the time I’m done: less than 1200 notes
amounting to 5 megabytes compressed, 11 megabytes plaintext.  The
index needed for full-text search with snippets is pretty much
equivalent to the corpus of notes.</p>
<p>Grepping the 4.5 megabytes with grep takes 0.6 seconds on my laptop,
but only 28 ms of that is user time; a second grep takes 42 ms of
which 32 ms is user time.  Generating a 200-megachar string in Firefox
with <code>Array(100*1000*1000).join(',a')</code> takes a few seconds and
provokes a warning about slow scripts, but then <code>.indexOf('a,b')</code> in
it takes 1.7 seconds, and <code>.indexOf('a,a,b')</code> in it takes 2.2 seconds,
and <code>a,a,a,a,b</code> takes 2.8, which, interpolated down to 11
megacharacters, would be 150 ms; so even brute-force search, without
even building an index, may be a reasonable implementation strategy.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that modern browsers generally don’t allow file://
HTML to access other file:// URLs via XMLHttpRequest, although old
versions of MSIE and the ActiveX XMLHttpRequest control did.  So
leaving the notes in static HTML makes full-text search impossible.</p>
<p>A possible solution would be to put the actual note text into .js
files and load them with <code>&lt;script src&gt;</code>, rather than putting it into
HTML.  The various HTML documents could load their respective text
from their respective .js files, while the search engine page could
load all of them and maybe build an in-memory index.</p>
<p>To keep the search-engine page reasonable to load, the number of .js
files should be limited.  64 might be a reasonable limit; this would
be 4–7 notes per 70-kilobyte .js file at present, increasing to 17–20
notes and 170K each by the time it’s done.  This doesn’t seem like a
grossly unreasonable number for a page load from the local filesystem,
and indeed it might end up being comparable to the amount of common JS
liabilities they load.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/dercuano.html">Dercuano</a> (16 notes)
