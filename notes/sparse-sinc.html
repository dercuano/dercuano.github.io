(10 minutes)</div><p>Is there a reasonable way to approximate a low-pass time-domain sinc
filter with a sparse filter cascade, in the sense described in <a href="../notes/sparse-filters.html">Sparse filters</a> and elaborated, for example, in <a href="../notes/sparse-kernel-cascade-gabor-approximation.html">Image filtering with an approximate Gabor wavelet or Morlet wavelet using a cascade of sparse convolution kernels</a>?</p>
<p>A sinc consists of two sine waves of the same frequency, 180 degrees
out of phase, joined with a kind of parabolic lump in the middle (the
"main lobe"), and with an overall hyperbolic envelope: go twice as far
out and the oscillations are half as high.  A sort of important thing
is that the zero-crossings are at perfectly regular intervals, except
that there's one missing in the middle, in the center of the parabolic
lump, which is instead the maximum of the whole function.</p>
<p>Most commonly, instead of convolving with the full sinc function,
which has annoyingly long support, we convolve with a windowed sinc
function, whose amplitude diminishes considerably more quickly.</p>
<p>A couple of different ideas occur to me for how to do this.</p>
<h2>Beating frequencies with a Gaussian window</h2>
<p>If we want a sine wave to go through a 180-degree phase shift, a
simple way to get this is to generate a beating signal by adding two
sine waves at frequencies above and below it.  For example, if we want
a 22,050-Hz sine wave to switch polarities 100 times a second, we can
add equal-amplitude sine waves at 22,000 Hz and 22,100 Hz.  If we put
a tight window around a zero-crossing of the phase, we can attenuate
the signal sufficiently that only a single crossover has a significant
amount of energy.</p>
<p><a href="../notes/sparse-kernel-cascade-gabor-approximation.html">Image filtering with an approximate Gabor wavelet or Morlet wavelet using a cascade of sparse convolution kernels</a> shows how to put a
Gaussian window on a sine wave by composing a feedback comb and a
feedforward comb, and by adding two different windowed sine waves you
can get much of the tails of a windowed sinc.  For better or worse,
the amplitude will diminish in the tails as exp(-<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>This doesn't provide the lump in the center, but perhaps we can get a
reasonable lump out of a simple (non-oscillating) Gaussian and add
that in.</p>
<p>The above gives us about 15 additions and subtractions per sample.</p>
<p>However, I think the envelope of this approach will be too far from
correct, because the sidelobes immediately next to the main lobe will
have amplitudes that are too small.</p>
<p>This approach is particularly interesting for a slightly different
application: as an ideal <em>bandpass</em> filter has a frequency response of
a symmetrical low-pass boxcar convolved with an impulse at its center
frequency, it has a time-domain response of the low-pass boxcar's sinc
<em>multiplied pointwise</em> by a sinusoid at the center frequency.  Where
the sinc crosses zero, the center-frequency sinusoid reverses phase.
So the beating trick can be used to get some of those sidelobes.</p>
<h2>Summing a bunch of in-phase Gaussian-windowed oscillations</h2>
<p>Suppose that, instead of trying to generate a beating frequency and
then window it, we start with a single Gabor kernel (a
Gaussian-windowed sinusoid) of, say, an eighth of the overall window
width.  Then we build up the overall hyperbolic envelope by adding
delayed and amplified copies of the thus-windowed signal, careful that
the delays don't put the various copies out of phase (except in the
middle).  Perhaps six or eight copies should thus be adequate to get a
good approximation to the overall hyperbolic envelope, and then, as
before, you need to add in the central lump.</p>
<p>The copies on opposite sides of the central lobe are the same
amplitude, so you can sum them first and then multiply them by the
amplitude; with this approach, eight copies will require four
additions and four multiply-accumulates, all starting from the same
windowed sinusoid.</p>
<p>With this approach we should need about six adds and subtracts to get
the initial windowed sinusoid, six adds and subtracts to get the
central lump, and four additions and four multiply-accumulates to put
the whole thing together: 20 operations in all.</p>
<h2>Summing exponentially-decaying oscillations</h2>
<p>The things above all work using Gaussian-windowed oscillations, but
while a real sinc decays as 1/<em>x</em>, the Gaussian decays as
exp(-<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>), which is a lot faster.  In between, we have
exponentially-decaying oscillations, such as those proceeding from the
feedback comb filter</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>x</em>(<em>t</em>) - <em>ky</em>(<em>t</em>-<em>s</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where 0 &lt; <em>k</em> &lt; 1.  Maybe such a decay could produce one of the tails
of the sinc filter efficiently, with a slower decay than the Gaussian
and potentially a much sharper onset, although you might want to tone
that down a bit in order to reduce discontinuities.</p>
<p>A feedforward-comb trick similar to the trick used to get
Gaussian-windowed oscillation can cut this exponential off after some
number <em>n</em> of oscillations by composing with a filter something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>y</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>x</em>(<em>t</em>) - <em>k</em><sup>2<em>n</em></sup><em>x</em>(<em>t</em>-2<em>ns</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will inevitably have some rounding error,
but the rounding error will decay exponentially thereafter, so it
shouldn't be a major concern in this application.  This allows you to
put together the tail out of a piecewise-exponential decaying
oscillation, although you can't derive each piece from the same
exponential the way you could with the Gaussians.</p>
<p>You might think to just use 1/<em>k</em> for the other tail, but in that case
the inevitable rounding error from the cutoff would grow exponentially
out of control.  A better approach, when it's feasible, is
bidirectional filtering --- not in the filtfilt way, where the two
unidirectional filters are <em>composed</em>, but where the results of the
two unidirectional filters applied to the same input signal are
<em>added</em>.</p>
<p>This bidirectional approach might give adequate results with a single
exponential tail in each direction, with the first impulse in the
oscillation being a quarter-cycle away from the origin.  This would be
two subtractions and two multiplications per sample, plus whatever
low-pass nonsense you need to do to get rid of the third and higher
harmonics.</p>
<h2>Summing flat oscillation plateaus</h2>
<p>The procedure mentioned earlier for generating a Gaussian-windowed
oscillation consists of convolving three or more rectangular-windowed
oscillations.  But another possibility is to <em>add</em> scaled
rectangular-windowed oscillations; for example, 64 oscillations scaled
by 1/64, 32 oscillations scaled by 1/64, 16 oscillations scaled by
1/32, 8 oscillations scaled by 1/16, 4 oscillations scaled by 1/8, 2
oscillations scaled by 1/4, and one oscillation scaled by 1/2.  This
gives you a sort of stepped-pyramid approximation of the sinc shape,
which you can then perhaps smooth a bit by convolving it with one or
more windowed oscillations at the same frequency.</p>
<p>This stepped pyramid requires a <em>single</em> oscillator (one subtraction),
seven subtractions to get the steps, then six additions (with binary
scale factors) to get each side of the sinc from them, for a total of
20 operations per sample.  Several more operations might be needed to
add the central lobe and smooth the steps.</p>
<p>(Maybe triangular-windowed oscillations would be a better basis
function, at least for the final tail; or you could tag on an
exponential decay.)</p>
<h2>Not worrying much about high harmonics</h2>
<p>Any departure from the perfect sinc shape in the resulting filter's
impulse response represents some kind of departure in the frequency
response from the desired boxcar --- either in passband flatness or in
some nonzero response in the stopband.  But some kinds of departure
are less harmful than others; for example, the comb filters we're
using here have not one passband but an infinite number, spaced at odd
harmonics of the normal passband.  In some sense this is an extreme
departure from ideal behavior, but it's not a particularly bad one;
unless the desired passband is very wide, the extra passbands are
located far enough away that it's easy to filter them out adequately
with fairly simple low-pass filtering.</p>
<p>By contrast, if you want a filter that passes 140 Hz to 150 Hz, and
you instead get a filter that passes 140 Hz to 151 Hz, that extra
hertz will be an extremely difficult error to remove.  These sparse
filters might actually be able to do a better job at this than
conventional FIR and IIR filters, because they can afford to use much
wider support, which means they can get much sharper frequency
cutoffs.</p>
<h2>Undertone filtering</h2>
<p>Because comb filtering passes (either all or odd) harmonics just as
strongly as the fundamental, you can compose combs at different
frequencies to get a filter that passes the common multiples of those
frequencies; for example, one third, one fifth, and one seventh of the
desired frequency (35/105, 21/105, and 15/105), maybe with a
feedforward comb to notch out any unwanted frequencies.  This is
useful when the frequency you want is not close to a factor of your
Nyquist frequency (or half the Nyquist frequency, in the
negative-feedback case).</p>
<p>(An alternative in such cases is often to use spectral inversion.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
