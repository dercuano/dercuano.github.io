<p>BubbleOS is a tiny bubble of sanity in a universe of insane operating
systems.  It’s self-bootstrappable — it includes all the tools needed
to build it, edit its source code, and so on — and it can be used as a
robust front end to a family of less sane systems.  This provides a
variety of benefits.</p>
<p>You can use BubbleOS as a standalone computing environment, run it as
dom0 under Xen, or run it as a process under Linux (including
Android), MacOS X, Microsoft Windows, or an HTML5 browser.</p>
<p>BubbleOS contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A hard-real-time secure windowing system.</li>
<li>A hard-real-time secure microkernel designed to protect the user
  from malicious applications.</li>
<li>A couple of hard-real-time secure terminal emulators.</li>
<li>A hard-real-time layout system built on a simplified version of the
  CSS box model.</li>
<li>A text editor.</li>
<li>A minimal TCP/IP implementation.</li>
<li>Minimal cryptographic facilities, an ssh client and server, and a
  Bitcoin client.</li>
<li>Encrypted swap and disk.</li>
<li>Unicode fonts.</li>
<li>Unicode text rendering including bidi and combining characters.</li>
<li>A bootstrapping chain of compilers, including assembler, low-level,
  high-level, and very-high-level languages.  The assembler is a
  variant of Forth, the low-level language is a subset of C, while the
  others are extended subsets of JS.</li>
<li>A compiler for a subset of C++ sufficient to cross-compile GCC.</li>
<li>A SAT solver which provides some of the horsepower for these
  compilers.</li>
<li>A virtual CPU machine set, with simulators for i386, amd64, RISC-V,
  and ARM(32), which runs all the other code.</li>
<li>A hardware design for this CPU.</li>
<li>A library of engineering models of many different physical
  phenomena.</li>
<li>A circuit design and synthesis system capable of synthesizing this
  CPU for certain Lattice FPGAs.</li>
<li>An analog circuit simulation program similar to SPICE.</li>
<li>A general mathematical optimization system that provides most of its
  horsepower.</li>
<li>Emulators capable of running CP/M, MS-DOS, or Apple ][ programs.</li>
<li>An image-format library capable of reading and writing most common
  image file formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and GIF.</li>
<li>A minimal web browser capable of fully rendering Wikipedia and Stack
  Exchange, though it lacks support for most modern web standards.</li>
<li>Snapshots of Wikipedia and Stack Exchange for offline viewing.</li>
<li>A fast, capable, secure web server.</li>
<li>The ability to checkpoint and migrate either a full machine image or
  an individual process.</li>
<li>Its full source code as a hypertext literate program.</li>
<li>A fast, secure, crashproof content-addressable filesystem that
  supports transactions.</li>
<li>A fast key-value store similar to LevelDB.</li>
<li>A minimal SQL database.</li>
<li>A terser database query language than SQL, but equally powerful,
  better suited to interactive exploration.</li>
<li>A fairly full set of data-wrangling facilities similar to Unix
  software tools, but implemented differently.</li>
<li>An implementation of Git.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not provide a POSIX API.</p>
<p>This is 32 major components in all.  I’d better get cracking!</p>
<h2>Naming</h2>
<p>Bikeshed-style, the thing I am currently devoting my attention to is
what to name the components.  Names from Consider Phlebas:</p>
<p>Perosteck Balveda (Juboal-Rabaroansa Perosteck Alseyn Balveda dam
T’seif), Gravant (alias for Perosteck Balveda), Amahain-Frolk,
Egratin, Bora Horza Gobuchul (Horza, shapeshifting traitor),
Xoralundra, Farn-Idir (sect), Schar, Heibohre, Rairch (species),
Kraiklyn, Zallin, Wubslin, Yalson, Gow, kee-Alsorofus, Marain
(language), Tzbalik Odraye, Mipp, Rava Gamdol, Aviger, Lenipobra, Lamm
(traitor), Cifetressi, Dorolow, Jandraligeli, Chicel-Horhava, Neisin,
Sro Kierachell Zorant, Fwi-Song (cannibal), Twenty-seventh (redshirt),
First (acolyte), Sarble the Eye, Ghalssel, Tengayet Doy-Suut, Wilgre,
Neeporlax, Xoxarle, Unaha-Closp (drone), Stafl-Preonsa Fal Shilde
’Ngeestra dam Crose (Fal ‘Ngeestra), Gimishin Foug.</p>
<p>Names from The Dispossessed: 46.  32 Pravic names along the same
lines:</p>
<p>Bebach, Chagvol, Chapis, Chekoks, Chigvigv, Dupin, Gvegob, Komush,
Kvakot, Kvushab, Lassep, Logog, Makul, Mokob, Pabar, Palab, Pechol,
Pevip, Pichok, Reshub, Shishek, Shivaks, Shumin, Sikvok, Siroks,
Skemun, Sotat, Suvun, Trapan, Trekvish, Vabon, Vavun.</p>
<p>Those are too similar.</p>
<p>Names from gen24.py:</p>
<p>Slilg, Floung, Gealgpru, Grapvirveag, Quiphdrusp, Kalgspricloost,
Theagproohool, Shophslylg, Wimsplup, Houbdrid, Quyngdryg, Azpream,
Greashgrystscoul, Yynpraint, Speazwhof, Scrussbres, Bealggusssprush,
Kelpluf, Kasplach, Ploonchag, Prontseng, Graispclooshchuss,
Kreassweaxheaph, Nyz, Yoontstaif, Doontdoup, Noosh, Clackblum,
Dechspat, Plosttaix, Splez.</p>
<p>Those are too silly.</p>
<p>Names from gen24.py generated with some English probabilities, with
real words removed:</p>
<pre><code>./gen24.py 40 /usr/share/dict/words .1 | awk '{print $1}' | LANG=C sort
</code></pre>
<p>Achem, Dep, Dirness, Atafli, Essdi, Enlini, Rera, Tiomtru, Dercal,
Bii, Abhar, Difodent, Nibanspo, Lincalent, Semeed, Veskeno, Ingex,
Lum, Onel, Chantcor, Iiz, Reelfin, Blocklo, Leconscrip, Ura, Satyrpo,
Editdish, Igstrud, Cing, Inon, Harfa, Etordot.</p>
<p>Okay, I think that’ll work.</p>
<p>Another candidate naming convention takes sequences of letters,
numbers, and symbols that spell words in Spanish.  For example, “5p”
means “faint away” and would work well for the checkpoint-and-restart
facility (as might “k+” “beds” or “ck” “dry”), “g+” means “jewels” and
would work well for a packaging system, “kb0” means “headboard” or
“header”.  And “ogo” means “glance” and would work well for the
windowing system.</p>
<p>Oops, unfortunately “ogo” is already “an OpenFlow Network controller
in Go”, a handheld computer sold from 2004–2006, an abbreviation for
“OpenGroupware.Org”, and a mobile phone dating app similar to Tinder.
So, without more detail, that name is right out.  Something like
“ogoak” (“ojeo acá”, “a glance here”) or "ogoc2o" (“silky glance”) or
"ogo☼o" (“ojeo solo”, “just a glance”) might work; none of them exist.</p>
<h2>Wercam: a hard-real-time secure windowing system</h2>
<p>Wercam securely multiplexes input and output between mutually
untrusting applications while guaranteeing glitch-free animation and
instant responsiveness to system commands 100% of the time, despite
the efforts of malicious applications.  Additionally, applications can
upload executable bytecode to Wercam to provide glitch-free
bounded-latency visual feedback to user actions without writing the
whole application as a bounded-latency system.</p>
<p>It includes VNC and RDP clients for remote access to other graphical
systems.</p>
<p>Wercam is about 1000 lines of real-time Leconscrip.</p>
<p>(The predecessor to 8½ was “a few hundred lines of source code using
[Newsqueak]”, and 8½ itself was about 5–15kloc, but 8½ supported 23
operations in /dev/bitblt and a bunch of font nonsense.  Rio was
smaller and simpler.)</p>
<p>See also files <a href="../notes/wercam-scriptable-windows.html">Scriptable windowing for Wercam</a>, <a href="../notes/window-systems.html">Window systems</a>, and
<a href="../notes/real-time-windowing.html">Real time windowing</a>.</p>
<h2>Intranin: a hard-real-time secure microkernel</h2>
<p>Intranin securely multiplexes the CPUs, memory, disk, and GPU between
mutually untrusting application processes, which are isolated using
objet-capability discipline, and furthermore securely enables
hard-real-time control applications to meet microsecond deadlines 100%
of the time.</p>
<p>Intranin is about 2000 lines of real-time Leconscrip, plus a few
hundred lines of Abhar assembly for each platform.</p>
<p>Oops, “DEP” (the original name) already has a meaning in infosec, “data execution
prevention”: <a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q4/82">https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q4/82</a>.  Renamed to
Shang.</p>
<p>Oops, “Shang” (the name replacing Dep) is already <a href="https://github.com/etherzhhb/Shang">https://github.com/etherzhhb/Shang</a>, free
software for compiling C to RTL.  Intranin!</p>
<h2>Atafli: hard-real-time secure terminal emulators</h2>
<p>Atafli is a set of character-cell terminal emulators that are hardened
against resource-exhaustion attacks.  They run on Wercam and are
useful for running older programs or providing access to remote
machines, but when writing programs for BubbleOS, it’s easier and
provides better results to use Essdi.</p>
<p>Atafli is about 500 lines of real-time Leconscrip.</p>
<h2>Essdi: a hard-real-time layout system</h2>
<p>Essdi is a modern replacement for character-cell terminal output
streams, preserving their ease of programming and guaranteed real-time
performance (a particularly big contrast when compared to the janky
pause-filled experience that is an HTML5 web browser) but providing
enough of the CSS box model that it’s easy to write things that look
good.  Most applications that run on Wercam use it to do their
layouts.</p>
<p>At times, Essdi privileges responsivity over correctness.</p>
<p>Essdi is about 800 lines of real-time Leconscrip.</p>
<h2>Editdish: A text editor</h2>
<p>In the 1970s, text editors were separate application programs, but
they turned out to be useful for handling the user interfaces of other
application programs.  Graphical user interfaces embedded tiny text
editors all over other applications.</p>
<h2>Enlini, a minimal TCP/IP implementation</h2>
<p>Enlini implements enough of TCPv4, IPv4, and UDPv4 to support the
minimal BubbleOS network services: an ssh client and server, a Bitcoin
client, and an HTTP client and server.  It uses a parser-driven
approach reminiscent of the STEPS TCP/IP stack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal cryptographic facilities, an ssh client and server, and a
  Bitcoin client, Rera.</li>
<li>Encrypted swap and disk, Tiomtru.</li>
<li>Unicode fonts, Dercal.</li>
<li>Unicode text rendering including bidi and combining characters, Bii.</li>
<li>A bootstrapping chain of compilers, including assembler, low-level,
  high-level, and very-high-level languages.  The assembler, Abhar, is
  a variant of Forth; the low-level language, Difodent, is a subset of
  C; and the others, Leconscrip, are extended subsets of JS.</li>
<li>A compiler for a subset of C++ sufficient to cross-compile GCC,
  Lincalent.</li>
<li>A SAT solver which provides some of the horsepower for these
  compilers, Semeed.</li>
<li>A virtual CPU machine set, with simulators for i386, amd64, RISC-V,
  and ARM(32), which runs all the other code, Veskeno.</li>
<li>A hardware design for this CPU, Ingex.</li>
<li>A library of engineering models of many different physical
  phenomena, Lum.</li>
<li>A circuit design and synthesis system capable of synthesizing this
  CPU for certain Lattice FPGAs, Onel.</li>
<li>An analog circuit simulation program similar to SPICE, Chantcor.</li>
<li>A general mathematical optimization system that provides most of its
  horsepower, Reelfin.</li>
<li>Emulators capable of running CP/M, MS-DOS, or Apple ][ programs,
  Blocklo.</li>
<li>Nibanspo: An image-format library capable of reading and writing most common
  image file formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and GIF.</li>
<li>Ura, A minimal web browser capable of fully rendering Wikipedia and
  Stack Exchange, though it lacks support for most modern web
  standards.</li>
<li>Satyrpo: snapshots of Wikipedia and Stack Exchange for offline
  viewing.</li>
<li>Igstrud: A fast, capable, secure web server.</li>
<li>Cing: The ability to checkpoint and migrate either a full machine
  image or an individual process, which produces an executable.</li>
<li>Inon: its full source code as a hypertext literate program.</li>
<li>Dirness: A fast, secure, crashproof content-addressable filesystem
  that supports transactions.</li>
<li>Harfa: A fast key-value store similar to LevelDB.</li>
<li>Etordot: A minimal SQL database.</li>
<li>Binate: A terser database query language than SQL, but equally
  powerful, better suited to interactive exploration.</li>
<li>Atsoled: A fairly full set of data-wrangling facilities similar to
  Unix software tools, but implemented differently.</li>
<li>Bonlar: An implementation of Git.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Bootstrapping sequence</h1>
<p>Veskeno, the virtual machine, is, in some sense, the bedrock of the
system; everything else runs within it.  But Veskeno alone is
unusable; you need programs for the virtual machine in order to do
things with it.  And for that you need at least some version of Abhar,
the assembler, running.</p>
<p>Given a definition for Veskeno’s instruction set and I/O architecture,
this ought to be a matter of a few hours of programming (initially in
C or Python), but coming up with the instruction set could easily take
longer than that.  Probably writing a few drafts is a good idea, but
then I need to test each one with some kind of code generator.</p>
<p>In Abhar or low-level Leconscrip I can write a bootstrap interpreter
for high-level Leconscrip, and then I can write a compiler for
high-level Leconscrip in itself.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
