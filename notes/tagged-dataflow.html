(2 minutes)</div><p>The whole tagged-token dataflow thing explains how to do something I'd
been wondering about for a long time.  It's too bad I didn't find out
about it earlier!</p>
<p>One of the big problems in these tagged-token machines seems to be how
to avoid filling up your memory.  It occurs to me that some node types
never increase the number of outstanding messages, others never
decrease them, and a few may do one or the other according to some
conditional.</p>
<p>If there is a scheduling executive in charge of deciding which pair to
next consume from memory, it can use this node type characteristic to
manage the size of memory at run-time, and thus perhaps the available
parallelism.  When it has available memory, it can run node types that
won't decrease the outstanding messages, as long as there are any
pairs of those types; and when it doesn't have available memory, it
can run node types that won't increase the outstanding messages, as
long as there are any pairs of those types.</p>
<p>The tricky node types can be handled by splitting them into three node
types.  Given an original node type T, we create TD, which does the
same thing as T in the cases where it decreases the number of
outstanding messages; TI, does the same thing as T in all other cases;
and TC, which evaluates the conditional to decide which path would be
taken, and then creates a pair invoking either TD or TI with the same
arguments.</p>
<p>I think we can still end up with cases where one execution order
results in filling up memory with unmatched messages, while a
different execution order would chug along indefinitely inside some
constant space bound.  I don't know how to avoid that inside the
dataflow paradigm.</p>
<p>XXX update with eeprom/tinycpu/fpga ideas (you can reduce
code-switching overhead in a machine with small code memory by
processing a lot of nodes of the same type all at once)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
