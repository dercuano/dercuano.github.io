  which is a TI MSP430, “16BIT 32KB FLASH 38TSSOP”.  16MHz, 32K
  flash, 4K RAM, probably the usual super low power, a 12-channel
  10-bit ADC, 32 GPIOs, internal oscillator, and so on.  Other
  MSP430 parts with 55601 available are #3.</li>

  Freescale S9S08SG16E1CTLR, “8BIT 16KB FLASH 28TSSOP,” from their
  S08 series, which I’ve never heard of before.  It’s the
  MC9S08SG32 in the datasheet, in the HCS08 category, originally
  the 68HC08 or HC08, the successor to the 68HC05, a successor to
  the 6800.  Also it’s sometimes called the 9S08.  So despite all
  the obfuscation this is a 6800.  But a 40MHz 6800 with memory
  paging and on-chip flash, 16K of it I guess.  Von Neumann, 22
  GPIOs (with two selectable output drive strengths plus an
  optional pullup on input), 8 interrupt pins with selectable
  priority, a 16-channel 10-bit ADC, SPI, I²C, wakeup timer, PWM
  generation, 1024 bytes of RAM.  Its big brother, the ...SG32,
  has 32K of flash and operates up to 150°.  Runs on 5V, normally
  uses an external crystal, though it has a 40MHz internal clock
  source too.  It has a “standard 6-pin header” for a documented
  “background debug mode” that’s driven through a single-wire
  serial protocol, typically bitbanged from a PC.  The BDM
  documentation says there are other secret test modes too.  It
  makes it sound like chips of this family found in the field
  might have the Flash-reprogramming functionality available
  through the debug port disabled.</li>

  PIC10F200T-I/OT, a 4MHz Microchip PIC with 384 bytes (!!) of
  flash, 16 bytes (!!!) of RAM, and 3 GPIOs, in a six-pin SOT-23
  package, 3.1mm × 1.75 mm × 1.3 mm.</li>

  <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/silicon-labs/EFM8SB20F16G-A-QFN24/336-3175-5-ND/5115732">http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/silicon-labs/EFM8SB20F16G-A-QFN24/336-3175-5-ND/5115732</a>
  Silicon Labs EFM8SB20F16G-A-QFN24, a 25MHz 8051, “8BIT 16KB
  FLASH 24QFN”, with 4¼ kibibytes of RAM and 16 kibibytes of
  flash.  This is the cheapest microcontroller with over 4K of
  RAM.  It runs off 1.8 to 3.6 volts, with 16 GPIOs, a 15-channel
  10-bit 300ksps ADC, a thermometer good to about half a degree,
  and a PWM generator; of the “Sleepy Bee” line, “the world’s most
  energy friendly 8-bit microcontrollers”.  50 nA sleep current
  (or 300 nA with the internal RTC running), 170 μA / MHz; most
  instructions are 1- or 2-cycle, so if we assume an average of 1½
  and 1.8V, that's about 200 pJ/insn.  The RAM is “256 bytes
  standard 8051 RAM and 4096 bytes on-chip XRAM”; the GPIOs are 5
  mA source, 12.5 mA sink.  And it has an internal 20MHz ±10%
  clock, an internal 16 (or 32?) kHz clock, and a 24.5MHz ±2%
  one, so you don't need an external crystal, and the RTC
  optionally uses a watch crystal.  Four timers.  It ships with a
  UART bootloader.  Its “on-chip debugging interface” is a thing
  called “C2 Silicon Labs 2-Wire”, which is apparently public.

  Atmel AT80C51RD2-3CSUM, which is a 5V 40MHz 8051 in a 40-pin DIP
  with no ROM; you hold its “external enable” pin low so that it
  executes code from an external ROM.</li>

<ul>
<li>163000 available of the US$0.71
  <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/LM317LIPK/296-21742-6-ND/1944499">http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/LM317LIPK/296-21742-6-ND/1944499</a>
  LM317LIPK, an adjustable ungrounded linear voltage regulator
  that can output from 1.2 to 32 V at up to 100 mA, in a tiny
  SOT-89-3 case.  This LM317L family is the low-current version of
  the regular 1500mA LM317.  You adjust it with an external
  voltage divider providing negative feedback from its output; I
  guess you could probably use a FET in its linear region to make
  it a more custom voltage regulator.  And you can also use it as
  a precision current source!  Note that this part is more popular
  than any of the microcontrollers.  Its datasheet includes
  instructions for how to make a slow-turn-on regulator circuit
  with it, I guess to ensure that your brownout detection circuits
  have time to do a power-on reset.</li>

  Toshiba TCR2EF12,LM(CT), “LDO 1.2V 0.2A SMV”.  This is a
  1.2-volt output voltage regulator with an 0.38V dropout and up
  to 200mA of output.  I am guessing that this is such an
  important voltage because of NiMH battery chargers, but I don't know.</li>
<li>14254 available of the US$0.12

  Microchip (ex-Micrel) MIC5365-3.0YC5-TR, a tiny (1mm×1mm!) 3V
  150mA linear regulator.  I think this may be the cheapest linear
  regulator of all.</li>

  STM M24C32-WMN6TP, a 400kHz 32-kibibit serial I²C EEPROM in an
  8-pin package.  STMicroelectronics will even sell you an unsawn
  wafer!  It supports random address reads, and also erases of
  individual 32-byte pages.</li>

  Winbond W25X40CLSNIG, a 104MHz (!) 4-mebibit (!!) dual SPI
  EEPROM in an 8-pin package.  It’s insane that this is literally
  256 times faster than and 128 times bigger than, but only 57%
  more expensive than, the #1 memory above.</li>
<li>5357 available of the US$0.13

  STMicroelectronics M24C02-FDW6TP, another 400kHz serial I²C
  EEPROM, this time 2 kibibits.  This one claims “More than
  200-year data retention,” which is a surprising claim I haven’t
  seen other Flash chips make, but now that I notice, the
  32-kibibit one above makes it too!</li>

  STMicroelectronics M95M02-DRMN6TP, another serial EEPROM with
  “200-year data retention”, but this time SPI, two megabits, and
  5 MHz!  It's in the same 8-SOIC as the others above.</li>

  STMicroelectronics TSV321RILT “Op Amp GP 1.4MHz RRO SOT23-5”,
  “General purpose input/output rail-to-rail low-power operational
  amplifiers”, going 200mV past the power rails, good up to 125°,
  now replaced by the LMV321L.  These are lower-voltage versions
  of the LMV324 for the 2.5–6V range, have a 1.3MHz GBP, and can
  source or sink up to 80mA and is stable driving up to 500pF of

  TI LMC6032IMX/NOPB, which is also a 1.4MHz GBP op-amp, but there
  are two op-amps on the chip, so it has 8 pins.  This one only
  sources or sinks up to 18mA, it’s not quite rail-to-rail, runs
  on 4.75–15.5V, and is stable driving up to 100pF of capacitive
  load.</li>
<li>83402 available of the US$0.77
  <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/rohm-semiconductor/BU7411SG-TR/BU7411SGDKR-ND/2791706">http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/rohm-semiconductor/BU7411SG-TR/BU7411SGDKR-ND/2791706</a>
  Rohm BU7411SG-TR, an “Op Amp GP 4KHZ 5SSOP”, which makes it
  sound like it’s worse than the TSV321$ in every way, orders of
  magnitude worse in the GBP.  But it only need 0.35μA of supply
  current, and needs even lower voltages: 1.6–5.5V.  It can only
  source or sink a couple milliamps on its output.</li>
<li>53751 available of the US$0.24

  Microchip MCP6001T-I/OT, the world’s cheapest op amp.  This is a
  rail-to-rail 1MHz GBP op-amp using 100μA and sourcing/sinking up
  to 23mA, running on 1.8 to 6 V, in a SOT-23-5.  It says it’s
  “low power” but it consumes 300 times what the BU7411SG above
  does.</li>

  Microchip MIC912YM5-TR “Op Amp VFB 200MHz SOT23-5”, which is the
  cheapest 10MHz-or-over op amp; this was a Micrel part before
  Microchip bought them.  This uses 2.4mA of supply current, is
  stable with unlimited capacitive loads, and runs on 2.5–9V.  The
  datasheet PDF is corrupted, so I can’t find out more.</li>

  Analog Devices. AD8606ACBZ-REEL7 “Op Amp GP 10MHZ RRO 8WLCSP”.
  It’s a dual-op-amp chip, and the most popular (as measured by
  Digi-Key stock) RF op amp.  It’s immune to oscillation and phase
  reversal even when driving large (1000 pF) capacitive loads, and
  its picoamp input offset current allows you to use large
  feedback resistors.</li>

  ON Semiconductor NCP302LSN20T1G two-volt detector in a 5-TSOP (a
  thin SOT-23 with five pins).  This is a power-on reset circuit.
  These suck 500 nA from 0.8 V to 10 V and produce an active-low

  Diodes Incorporated APX809-31SAG-7, which is basically the same
  thing, but with a 3.08V threshold voltage, a fixed delay of
  240ms instead of a programmable delay, and only 3 pins.  It
  sucks 30000 nA though and only works in the 1.1 to 5.5 volt

  TI TPS61221DCKR, a TPS61221DCKR, described as “Boost Switching
  Regulator IC Positive Fixed 3.3V 1 Output 200mA (Switch)
  6-TSSOP, SC-88, SOT-363”.  This takes an input of anywhere from
  0.7 to 5.5 volts and turns it into a 3.3-volt ±3% output at up
  to 200mA.  It needs an external inductor (4.7μH suggested,
  higher inductances give higher efficiency) and a couple of 10μF
  capacitors; the adjustable-voltage versions also use a couple of
  resistors for feedback.  At over 1V input and from 0.1 to 100 mA
  output, it’s over 80% efficient; above 2.3V input and 0.3 mA
  output, it’s over 90% efficient.  This is basically intended for
  running 3.3V circuits off rechargeable batteries.</li>

  Alpha Omega AOZ1280CI, described as “Buck Switching Regulator IC
  Positive Adjustable 0.8V 1 Output 1.2A SOT-23-6”.  This is a
  step-down switching regulator that takes 3–26V in and produces a
  1.5MHz PWM output signal which you filter with a 2.2μH output
  inductor and a 10μF output bypass cap to get whatever voltage
  you want (programmed with a 800mV voltage divider), down to
  0.8V, at up to 1.2 amps.  It’s “up to 95% efficient”, but
  typically more like 80–90%.  It sucks a whole milliamp itself,
  though, so it's not suitable for super low-power circuits.</li>

  TI 555 (NE555P), the chip that gave birth to this product
  category in the 1970s.  The datasheet says, “September
  1973—revised September 2014”, which I guess means TI bought
  Signetics at some point.  Astable or monostable operation.
  Sinks or sources up to 200mA, runs on 4.5 to 16 volts, at 1

  TI SN74LS628DR, aka 74628, a 20MHz VCO, an improved version of
  the 74LS324, using an external timing resistor to improve
  temperature compensation.  Datasheet is from 1980, revised 1988.
  It can oscillate at roughly 2MHz to 20MHz as the
  frequency-control input voltage ranges from 1V to 5V.</li>

  Atmel AT40K20AL-1BQU, a 1024-cell 3.3V FPGA (“30000 gates”) with
  8192 bits of 10ns RAM and 114 5V-tolerant GPIOs in an LQFP.
  Supposedly good up to 100MHz, with 50MHz multipliers.  Its cells
  have propagation delays of about 2 ns, are capable of
  implementing full-adders or even multiplier bits, and have
  diagonal interconnections to make multipliers out of.  Bitstream
  format and debugging features are apparently not documented.</li>

  Microsemi A3P030-QNG48, a ProASIC3/E FPGA with 34 3.6V-tolerant
  GPIO and “30000 gates”.  “Ideal for CPLD replacement.”  “1.5 V
  single voltage operation.” “350 MHz system performance.”  1024
  bits of flash that it can’t write to (and also its programming
  is stored in flash; it doesn’t have to load a bitstream to
  boot).  Consists of 768 "VersaTiles" which are three-input
  arbitrary functions registered with D flip-flops, but no RAM.
  No AES protection on its JTAG ISP.  Quiescent supply current is
  2 mA, enormous compared to the microcontrollers.  Maximum JTAG
  TCK clock is 19MHz.  Bitstream format and debugging features are
  apparently not documented.</li>

  AVX TAJB226M010RNJ 22μF ±20% 10V 2.4Ω capacitor in a 3.5 mm ×
  2.8 mm package.  This is not the highest-energy-capacity
  capacitor in the series (that would be the 25V 150μF type,
  holding 47 mJ, like the TAJV157M025#NJ in a 7.3 mm × 6.1 mm
  case, though Digi-Key doesn’t carry it; they'll sell you the
  lower-voltage 20V type TAJV157M020RNJ at US$2.17 but only in
  lots of 400) but it still has a pretty impressive energy
  density.  These are advertised as “standard tantalum”
  capacitors; I think that means they don’t have wet electrolyte.
  AVX's wet tantalum page explains, “AVX’s wet tantalum capacitors
  offer higher capacitance and voltage capability than solid
  tantalum capacitors.”  On another page, they say, “We are the
  global leader in MnO₂ solid tantalum technologies such as
  smallest case size MnO₂, highest temperature capabilities up to
  230°C and lowest DCL product offering,” and the TAJ series is
  indeed on that page.</li>

<h2>Some interesting notes from the above list</h2>
<ul>
<li>High-speed serial interfaces usually are SPI rather than I²C.</li>
<li>Although sub-picojoule-per-instruction CPUs exist in research labs,
  the ones you can actually buy are up in the hundreds-of-pJ range.</li>
