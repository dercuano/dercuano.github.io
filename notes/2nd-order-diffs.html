(3 minutes)</div><p>If you're compressing a numerical sequence, such as a digitized sound
wave, you only rarely see exact repetition of sample number sequences;
the smallest noise or varying DC offset (i.e. low-frequency noise)
will cause all the samples in the sequence to be different.  As a
result, schemes like LZ77 don't do well at compressing digital
signals.</p>
<p>Even the very simplest numerical signals fail in this way.  For
example, if you have a series of 16-bit samples, each being 258 times
the sample number, it will repeat every 131072 bytes; but <code>gzip -9</code>
can only compress it by 1.4%.  (bzip2 -9 does better, compressing 8:1,
partly because of its bigger block size; bzip2 -1 only compresses
2:1.)</p>
<p>But if you take the second-order finite forward differences of this
sequence, they will be 0 258 0 0 0 0... which is very highly
compressible.  In fact, even memoryless schemes like Elias gamma
coding will work somewhat well at this point, about as well as bzip2.
But applying gzip to the above sequence gives you 961-fold
compression, while bzip2 gives you 10280-fold compression.</p>
<p>In general, we should expect this to be the case for mostly continuous
functions of time: the first and second-order forward differences
should be much more highly compressible than the original sequence.</p>
<p>From a Fourier perspective, the finite-forward-differences operation
is a single-pole high-pass filter with no knee: it just keeps
attenuating at 6dB per octave all the way to DC.  Two iterations of it
give you 12dB per octave, strongly attenuating the low-frequency
content and leaving you only the high-frequency content to encode.</p>
<p>You could ask why only second-order rather than higher orders: if a
second-order predictor is good, wouldn't a fifth-order or
twentieth-order predictor be better?  It might be, depending on your
data.  The order multiplies discontinuities: a single impulse becomes
two opposite impulses in first-order differences, three impulses in
second-order differences, and twenty-one in twentieth-order
differences.  This kind of effect might outweigh the improved
compression from removing higher-order regularities from the data.</p>
<p>The Fourier-analysis viewpoint might suggest that this is a lossy
scheme, concerned with numerical approximation, but applied to a group
(such as N-bit integers under mod-2**N addition) it is perfectly
lossless.  If you apply it to IEEE-488 floating-point numbers it will
indeed be lossy, I think, because floating-point numbers are not a
group.  (Right?)</p>
<p>This is somehow related to linear predictive coding, in the sense that
the finite differences at a given timestep are a linear function of
the sample value at previous timesteps, and their "predictions" at
future timesteps are also linear functions of them, and the Nth-order
difference somehow represents a "residual" from that "prediction".</p>
<p>Various lossless audio compression codecs (Shorten, AudioPaK, and
FLAC, for example) use linear prediction in this way to decorrelate
the samples they are compressing.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
