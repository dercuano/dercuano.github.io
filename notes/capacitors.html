(5 minutes)</div><p>As representative electrolytics, let’s choose the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/ECA-0JHG102/P5509-ND/245108">Panasonic
ECA-0JHG102</a> and the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/nichicon/UWT1H470MCL1GS/493-2225-6-ND/746186">Nichicon UWT1H470MCL1GS</a>.</p>
<p>The Panasonic ECA-0JHG102 costs 44¢ down to 10.4¢ (quantity 5000).
It’s a 1000μF 6.3V 8mm-diameter 11.5mm-long capacitor rated for 380mA
at 120Hz or 437mA at 100kHz.  Its leakage current is 3 μA or “0.01
CV”, presumably per second; this works out to 63 microcoulombs when
fully charged, so probably 63 μA.  The datasheet doesn’t give ESL,
ESR, or self-resonant frequency, but lists frequency-dependent
characteristics only up to 100kHz.  It lists the tangent of the loss
angle, though.</p>
<p>The Nichicon UWT1H470MCL1GS costs 47¢ down to 19.4¢ (quantity 100).
It’s a 47μF 50V 6.3mm-diameter 7.7mm-long SMD capacitor rated for 63mA
at 120Hz or 94.5mA at 10kHz, with exactly the same leakage current
spec as the Panasonic part.  Its loss-angle tangent is 0.14, and its
frequency-dependent characteristics are listed only up to 10kHz.  No
ESL is listed or suggested.</p>
<p>As representative supercapacitors, the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/nichicon/JUWT1105MCD/493-4330-ND/2538684">Nichicon JUWT1105MCD</a> and
the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/elna-america/DSK-3R3H204T614-H2L/604-1147-6-ND/2171204">Elna DSK-3R3H204T614-H2L</a>.</p>
<p>The Nichicon JUWT1105MCD costs 92¢ down to 30¢ (quantity 5000). It’s a
1-farad 2.7V 6.3mm-diameter 10.5mm-long EDLC rated at 4Ω ESR at 1kHz.
The datasheet lists a 4Ω “DCR”, but I don’t know what that is;
surely not a discharging current resistance,
since that would discharge it within seconds.  The
capacitance rating is based on discharging in, I guess, 270 seconds
after a 30-minute (!) charge cycle.</p>
<p>The Elna DSK-3R3H204T614-H2L costs 195¢ down to 92¢ (quantity 500).
It’s a 200-millifarad 3.3V 6.8mm-diameter 1.4mm-thick EDLC that looks
for all the world like a coin cell with strip terminals soldered onto
it for a total thickness of 1.8 mm and a total width of 11.7mm.  It’s
rated at 200Ω internal resistance.  The datasheet mentions absolutely
nothing about time or frequency, but it seems like these are actually
intended as battery replacements.</p>
<p>Neither supercapacitor lists a leakage current rating.</p>
<p>The above capacitors are all rated for endurance of 1000 or 2000
hours, though at different temperatures.  By contrast, as
representative tantalum capacitors, let’s consider the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/avx-corporation/TAJB226M010RNJ/478-3040-6-ND/1717036">AVX
TAJB226M010RNJ</a>, the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/ECS-H1AX475R/PCT2475DKR-ND/1835780">Panasonic ECS-H1AX475R</a>, and the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/avx-corporation/TAP104K035SCS/478-1831-ND/563934">AVX
TAP104K035SCS</a>.</p>
<p>The AVX TAJB226M010RNJ costs 69¢ down to 23¢ (quantity 1000).  It’s a
surface-mount 1411 (3.5mm × 2.4mm, 2.1mm high) or possibly 1210
(3.5 mm × 2.8 mm, 2.8 mm high) 22μF 10V conventional MnO₂ tantalum
capacitor with a rated ESR of 2.4Ω at 100kHz.  All the
frequency-dependent stuff in its datasheet is just listed at 100kHz
and no other frequencies.  It claims to withstand a 13V surge voltage
and have a failure rate of 1% per 1000 hours at 85°, if I understand
correctly.  Its leakage current is 2.2 μA.  At low temperatures, it’s
rated for 188 mA ripple current.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/avx-corporation/TAP104K035SCS/478-1831-ND/563934">AVX TAP104K035SCS</a> costs 66¢ down to 19¢ (quantity 5000).
It’s a through-hole 35V 0.1μF 7mm-high 2.5mm-diameter tantalum cap
rated for a failure rate of 1% at 1000 hours at 85°.  Its ESR is
listed as 26Ω at 100kHz.  It leaks 0.5μA.</p>
<p>What about multilayer ceramic capacitors?  Let’s take the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/vishay-bc-components/A104K15X7RF5TAA/1109PHCT-ND/145913">Vishay
A104K15X7RF5TAA</a>, the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/murata-electronics-north-america/LLL219R70J105MA01L/490-4354-1-ND/1022498">Murata LLL219R70J105MA01L</a>, the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/murata-electronics-north-america/GJM1555C1H4R7CB01D/490-3100-1-ND/702366">Murata
GJM1555C1H4R7CB01D</a>, and the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/johanson-technology-inc/500R07S0R5BV4T/712-1162-1-ND/1786624">Johanson 500R07S0R5BV4T</a> as
examples.</p>
<p>The Vishay A104K15X7RF5TAA costs 26¢ down to 13¢ (quantity 2500).
It’s a through-hole 50V 100nF X7R axial-lead capacitor, 2.5 mm
diameter and 3.8 mm long. …</p>
<p>The Murata GJM1555C1H4R7CB01D costs 12¢ to 1.9¢ (quantity 5000) and is
a 50V C0G/NP0 4.7 pF 0402 SMD MLCC.  C0G/NP0 devices are optimized for
high precision and low loss rather than high capacitance, although
this one is still ±5%.  It’s tiny at 1 mm × 500 μm × 550 μm. …</p>
<p>The Murata LLL219R70J105MA01L costs 44¢ to 11.5¢ (quantity 1000) and
is also a SMD MLCC, this one X7R 0508 and with reversed terminals for
low ESL.  It’s 1μF and 6.3V.  Its 0508 size is larger, at 1.25 mm ×
2 mm × 850 μm. …</p>
<p>The Johanson 500R07S0R5BV4T costs 16.0¢ to 2.7¢ and is another C0G/NP0
0402 MLCC, this time of only 0.5 pF.  This capacitance seems small
enough that it would be likely to happen by accident, without an
actual capacitor, but what do I know?  The tolerances are
proportionally rather loose: ±0.1 pF, which ends up being ±20%. …</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
