(6 minutes)</div><p>I want to write a minimal self-sustaining programming environment to
work from.</p>
<p>What’s the absolute minimum you need for a self-sustaining programming
environment?</p>
<p>You need a user interface including some kind of text editor, stable
storage, a compiler, and a bootloader.  The stable storage thing needs
to support at least some minimum of version control, so you can store
previous versions of the code, if nothing else.  And a textual user
interface needs a font, which means you need some kind of drawing
program.</p>
<p>It’s probably also almost unavoidable at this point to support network
access, hotplugging, power management, foreign filesystems,
cryptography, and HTML; it would be very useful to also have type
checking, JS, and a debugger.</p>
<p>If it’s going to be self-sustaining down to the hardware design level,
it also needs a CPU design, a RAM design, and some kind of circuit
layout and simulation tools.  If the CPU design is written at some
higher level than netlists, it needs to be able to synthesize RTL from
whatever the CPU design is expressed in and to synthesize netlists
from RTL.</p>
<p>If it’s additionally going to be self-sustaining down to the hardware
fabrication level, it needs servo control algorithms, a cyclic
fabrication system, motion planning, finite element simulation and
optimization, and some 3-D geometry handling (even if only voxels).</p>
<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>For a visual UI, minimally you need at least one font, some kind of
text layout system (to put text into lines, if nothing else), and
enough rendering to get it onto the screen.  It’s also very desirable
to have mouse support and windowing, especially for the drawing
program.</p>
<p>A text editor needs to efficiently support movement, insertion,
deletion, text search, and cut-and-paste, at least on the sizes of
files you’re likely to encounter.  You may also need some interface to
load and save files in it, if you have files.</p>
<p>There also needs to be some kind of way to invoke other programs that
you’ve written; Emacs does this with ^J and M-x, as well as the shell.</p>
<p>You also need drivers for keyboard (or touchscreen) and mouse, if
present.</p>
<h2>Stable storage</h2>
<p>You need some kind of filesystem.  It doesn’t need to necessarily be a
traditional hierarchical filesystem, although that would ease
compatibility with existing systems, but there needs to be some way to
not have to retype everything from memory every time you power-cycle
the machine.  Smalltalk and other image-based environments do okay
here, but they imply you need some kind of hot code upgrade facility,
and then you have to build in some other way of doing version control.</p>
<p>Forth’s filesystem is probably the most minimal here: the “files” are
sequentially numbered disk blocks.</p>
<h2>Compiler</h2>
<p>For a self-sustaining system, interpreters are optional, but compilers
are mandatory.  The compiler can be very simple, down to simply
concatenating prewritten snippets of code and fixing up pointers, but
it needs to exist, or you can’t ever run your code.  Furthermore, you
need two duplicates of it: an executable bootstrap compiler or
interpreter that can run on some existing system, and a source-code
compiler that can run under the bootstrap as well as compiling itself.</p>
<p>My experience with Ur-Scheme makes me think that dynamic typing, a
relatively simple grammar, ruthlessly polysemic data types, and making
everything explicit will minimize the difficulty of writing the
self-compiling compiler.  My experience with peg-bootstrap and Prolog
makes me think that backtracking and similar logic-programming or
constraint-solving tricks can simplify tokenization and parsing down
to a very simple task.  My minimal experience with Forth makes me
think that you probably do want syntax and typechecking.</p>
<h2>Bootloader</h2>
<p>The bootloader is almost entirely dependent on the environment you’re
running in.  UEFI lets you load whatever you like from a certain
version of the FAT filesystem, already in 32-bit mode.  BIOS is
hairier, but you still only need a few dozen instructions.</p>
<h2>Network access</h2>
<p>An OS without TCP/IP is not useful for most purposes nowadays.  Wi-Fi,
maybe via a USB dongle, is perfectly adequate at the physical level,
but you still need the whole stack on top of that.  Contiki’s lwip is
the standard in tiny TCP/IPs, but it’s sixty thousand lines of C.  The
VPRI tiny TCP/IP stack is much smaller, but I don’t know where to find
it or how to get it running.</p>
<h2>Hotplugging</h2>
<p>Lack of hotplugging is what doomed sysvinit in Linux, leading to its
replacement with a poorly-designed monstrosity called systemd.  I’m
not totally 100% sure about why plugging devices into a “hot” USB
network requires rewriting the entire software stack while plugging
devices into a “hot” Ethernet doesn’t, but there you have it.</p>
<p>You need some kind of event bus to coordinate responses to either kind
of event, so you can’t get by with the traditional Unix IPC mechanisms
of pipes and a shared global mutable filesystem, unless you want to
have to poll all the time.  But this broadcast/multicast IPC mechanism
could totally run as a user process.  Then again, in Minix even memory
management is a user process.</p>
