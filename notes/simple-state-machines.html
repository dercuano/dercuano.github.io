(8 minutes)</div><p>I was thinking about laser-cut mechanical computation systems.  What
are the simplest finite-state machines I could usefully implement?</p>
<h2>Bit transformation pipelines</h2>
<p>The simplest finite-state machines have two states and two inputs.
There are 16 possible such machines, corresponding to the 16
fundamental logic gates.  Calling the state Q and the input I, we can
display all 16 state transition tables as one:</p>
<pre><code>Q I   new state; each column defines a machine
0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1   0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0   0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1   0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
</code></pre>
<p>Many of these machines are not very interesting; you kind of need
transitions in both directions between the states to be interesting.
That reduces the table to the following:</p>
<pre><code>Q I   new state; each column defines a machine
0 0   0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1   1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0   0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 1   0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
</code></pre>
<p>You also probably want to eliminate the state machines where the two
possible inputs are equivalent.  If the two states are equivalent,
that might still be okay, because the state itself might be the
machine’s output.  This eliminates one more machine, which alternated
between states incessantly regardless of the input, reducing the table
to the following:</p>
<pre><code>Q I   new state; each column defines a machine
0 0   0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1   1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 0   0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 1   0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
</code></pre>
<p>We can characterize these eight machines as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0100: stable in state 0 when the input is 0, but when triggered by a
  1 input, transitions to state 1 for one cycle.  Alternatively you
  could call it a controllable oscillator: the input turns it on, and
  when the input is off, it stays in state 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0101: its state is the input from the previous cycle.  This is
  basically a D flip-flop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0110: stable in either state when the input is 0, but oscillates
  when the input is 1.  This is basically a T flip-flop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1000: the same as 0100 with the sense of the input inverted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1001: the same as 0110 with the sense of the input inverted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1010: its state is the inverted input from the previous cycle, like
  a D flip-flop's Q̅ inverted output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1101: stable in state 1 when the input is 1, but when triggered by a
  0 input, transitions to state 0 for one cycle.  This is the same as
  0100 but with the input and the state both inverted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1110: same as 1101, but with the input inverted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can classify these “interesting” machines into three categories of
behavior.  Oscillators (0100, 1000, 1101, 1110) produce a
Nyquist-frequency square wave when the input is in one state, or a
constant history-independent output when it is in a different state.
Delays (0101, 1010) delay the input by a clock cycle (and 1010 inverts
it too).  Bistable machines (0110, 1001) can stably remember a bit of
information over time, but there is a given input that will cause them
to switch (1 for 0110, 0 for 1001).</p>
<p>In a sense these machines all have “fan-in”: even though they only
have a single one-bit input, their output is a function of their
previous input history (and initial state) as well their current
input.  But because they can only take a single input, the only
topology in which you can hook them together is as a fanning-out tree,
in which any given bit of output is produced from a linear pipeline of
state machines from the input bitstream.  (Alternatively, you could
hook them up into a loop, taking no input from outside.)</p>
<p>This may be adequate to do things like produce a binary count of the
number of 1 bits in a bitstream, although I’m not even sure of that.
An interesting question is whether such a pipeline can in some sense
emulate any arbitrary finite state machine (that doesn’t get stuck),
or what its expressive limits are, and how many of the above machines
are needed to provide that expressiveness — presumably you need at
least a bistable machine.</p>
<p>The lack of signal fan-in keeps the delay machines from being
especially useful in this context, so we can consider just the
bistable and oscillator machines.</p>
<p>If you feed a Nyquist-frequency square wave into a bistable machine,
you get a half-Nyquist-frequency square wave.  If you feed that into
the appropriate kind of oscillator, it will reduce the duty cycle of
the square wave; feeding that into another bistable machine gives you
a quarter-Nyquist-frequency square wave.  Feeding that into another
bistable machine gives you the repeating sequence 10100000 or its
complement.  If you feed that into a bistable 0110 that's initially in
the 0 state, it becomes 01000000, which when fed to another one
becomes an eighth-Nyquist-frequency square wave.</p>
<p>This brings up the interesting fact that the initial states of the
state machines can matter a lot.  You could imagine a loop of such
machines whose “input” is provided entirely by its initial state.</p>
<h2>Time-delayed logic gates</h2>
<p>If we consider state machines with two states and two binary inputs,
one of them is a time-delayed NAND gate:</p>
<pre><code>Q I J   new state
0 0 0   1
0 0 1   1
0 1 0   1
0 1 1   0
1 0 0   1
1 0 1   1
1 1 0   1
1 1 1   0
</code></pre>
<p>This is clearly sufficient for universal computation on its own,
without any other kinds of machines.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of finite state machine that is in some sense
simpler than this, but that still allows us to build universal
computers by connecting networks of them together?  I don’t think
there is.</p>
<h2>J-K flip-flops</h2>
<p>Above I mentioned that D and T flip-flops were two of the three kinds
of interesting bit-transformation machines.  J-K flip-flops are more
widely used as a discrete component; their state transition table,
assuming active-high inputs, looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Q J K  new state
0 0 0  0
0 0 1  0
0 1 0  1
0 1 1  1
1 0 0  1
1 0 1  0
1 1 0  1
1 1 1  0
</code></pre>
<p>This seems to me like it is certainly a universal gate in the same
sense as the delayed NAND above, which is in some sense of equivalent
complexity.  You have inputs that will set the stored bit or clear it
when they are high, and you can connect them to separate places.
Additionally you have the magic power of making the output oscillate
by putting them both high.</p>
<p>This extra magic power is pretty clearly not needed; you could use it
as just an S-R flip-flop.  But if you try to use this to simplify the
machine, you are kind of forced to lump J and K together into one
input:</p>
<pre><code>Q I  new state
0 0  0
0 J  1
0 K  0
1 0  1
1 J  1
1 K  0
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with this is that you have lost not just fan-in but also
compositionality; this machine’s state can no longer be the input of
another identical machine.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/mechanical.html">Mechanical things</a> (45 notes)
