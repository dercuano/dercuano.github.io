(4 minutes)</div><p>I saw an article on HN the other day with a title like “the opposite
of a Bloom filter”, making the observation that if you make a hash
table where you resolve collisions by simply discarding one of the
colliding keys, then you get a probabilistic-set data structure that
may have false negatives but never false positives, which is in some
sense the reverse of a Bloom filter.  It's very similar in a sense to
a CPU memory cache (which also tracks the contents of memory as well
as the data present there).</p>
<p>This comes at a fairly heavy space cost compared to typical Bloom
filters, since you have to actually store the keys in order to ensure
that you aren’t getting false positives.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that you could use this approach to implement an
efficient stateless gossip protocol for large datasets, but then it
occurred to me that actually you can do better with Bloom filters.</p>
<h2>Bloom filter approach</h2>
<p>When you make contact with a new peer, generate a
high-false-positive-probability Bloom filter of your current set of
keys, using HMAC as the hash algorithm, keyed with a random nonce.
Send the filter and the nonce to the peer.  The false-positive
probability can reasonably be as high as 90%, which should allow you
to use a single hash function and much less than one bit per key.</p>
<p>When you receive a filter and a nonce, hash all your keys with the
nonce and probe to see which are in the filter.  If any are not in the
filter, send them in your reply.</p>
<p>This sends a randomly selected 10% of the missing data to the peer.
This should be sufficient to provide efficient information
distribution if encounters are frequent but happen at intervals
relatively large compared to the communication latency.  In
particular, it should be possible to keep the filters several orders
of magnitude smaller than the dataset being synchronized, and each
node will almost always receive each data item only once, even if it's
simultaneously syncing with multiple peers.</p>
<p>With a fixed false-positive probability, the filter will grow linearly
with the dataset.  This problem can be avoided by increasing the
false-positive probability over time, but of course that makes the
network gradually slower as information accretes.  Suppose that,
instead, we partition the dataset into epochs of, say, one day each,
in such a way that each node can determine independently which epoch a
particular key belongs to, and we compute and transmit a separate
filter for each epoch.  Then we can choose a different convergence
rate for each epoch: perhaps I want today's epoch to have a 90% false
positive rate, but yesterday's 95%, 97% for the day before, and so on.
In this way it is possible to continue very slow convergence even for
very old epochs.</p>
<p>(Rathe than choosing different filter sizes, you could merge different
numbers of epochs into each filter, producing different load factors;
this is probably actually a better idea.  So you might have one filter
for the current minute, one filter for the previous three minutes, one
filter for the previous nine minutes, and so on.)</p>
<p>In addition to being more efficient, this approach is somewhat more
privacy-protecting than the standard approach used by e.g. BitTorrent,
in which you send a full list of all the keys (pieces, in the
BitTorrent case) you have.  That list of keys is almost certainly
enough to identify you uniquely for a period of time.  By contrast, it
should be somewhat more difficult to identify the sender of such a
filter: infeasible if you have no idea what keys might have been
hashed into it, but even if you have some candidate keys, each one
only gives you a small, probabilistic amount of information.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
