(4 minutes)</div><p>I want to implement preemptive multithreading inexpensively at the
level of a language compiler with a hard upper bound on response
times, without depending on interrupts.  This means that the compiled
program has to yield control to a scheduler every so often, and we
need to statically guarantee that it never goes for a long time
without yielding; but, while the scheduler check is relatively
inexpensive, it isn’t free — maybe 100 or 1000 CPU cycles.  (For
example, if the scheduler calls select() to see if there are I/O
events that need to be handled, that’s about 3000 cycles.)  So we’d
like to use static analysis to avoid inserting it in too many places
if we can.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose our program is built from the following grammar:</p>
<pre><code>function ::= name expr
expr ::= instruction | call | seq | forloop | whileloop | conditional
call ::= "call" name
seq ::= expr ";" expr
forloop ::= "for" var const expr
whileloop :;= "while" expr expr
conditional :;= expr "if" expr "else" expr
</code></pre>
<p>This version has a statically computable control-flow graph and
therefore doesn’t accommodate function pointers; you could treat them
as CLOS-style generic functions and treat them as conditionals on a
type test.</p>
<p>I’m glossing over parameter passing and local variable allocation for
the time being; you can consider them to be implemented by some
unspecified instructions.</p>
<p>It seems clear how to compute a conservative approximation of
run-time-before-yield.  whileloops can run forever, as can recursive
functions; either of these need to have a yield inserted into them.
Then, the run-time-before-yield of a call expression is the
run-time-before-yield of the function it calls, plus a tiny amount;
each instruction presumably has a known worst-case
run-time-before-yield; a seq expression’s worst-case
run-time-before-yield is the sum of those of its children; a forloop’s
is N times that of its body expression, where N is the constant; and a
conditional is the maximum of its two branches plus its condition.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to separately compute a worst-case run-time
<em>before</em> yielding and a worst-case run-time <em>after</em> yielding for each
syntax tree node.</p>
<p>Note that the above remains safe even in the presence of early-exit
instructions from either loops or entire functions: those might
shorten the run-time, but they can’t lengthen it.</p>
<p>Inserting yields optimally is almost certainly an NP-hard problem.</p>
<p>Ideally if you have a recursive loop of functions, you would only
insert a yield into the prologue of one of the functions rather than
all of them.</p>
<p>You can generally do a better approximation.  Most while loops are not
intended to run forever; by supplying a “loop variant”, an integral
nonnegative quantity that strictly decreases every iteration, you can
guarantee that the loop terminates and even provide an upper bound on
its iteration count.  But that level of detail probably isn’t
necessary for inserting yields, and it probably requires extra work
from the programmer.</p>
<p>This kind of analysis also works, with some tweaks, for bounding stack
depths and total heap allocation size, either to optimize the number
of checks down toward some limit or to provide strong static bounds on
resource usage, statically guaranteeing resource adequacy.  (Heap
allocation can be twice as fast if it doesn’t have to check the
allocation pointer against the end of the arena, and implementations
of threading and call/cc that use segmented stacks also normally have
to bounds-check the stack poitner on every function call.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
