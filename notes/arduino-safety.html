(4 minutes)</div><p>I just watched <a href="https://youtu.be/zASxHFxf6oY">a video</a> on the YouTube channel “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/greatscottlab">GreatScott</a>”
in which the author builds a modified-square-wave inverter using a
MOSFET H-bridge driven through a couple of TC4427s.</p>
<p>I was somewhat horrified at the way he wrote the software; he writes
<code>off()</code>, <code>lowon()</code>, and <code>highon()</code> functions which each set the
transistors to the appropriate states.  If you call the <code>off()</code>
function often enough, everything is fine, but if you call <code>highon()</code>
after calling <code>lowon()</code> without an intervening <code>off()</code>, you get
shoot-through; the first thing it does is bring Arduino pin 9 LOW,
which pulls pin 1, the gate of the P-channel MOSFET on the high side
of the left of the H-bridge, to ground, turning on the MOSFET.  But
Arduino pin 8 is still HIGH, pulling pin 3, the gate of the N-channel
MOSFET to ground on the left side of the H-bridge, to 12V, also
turning it on.  So you get shoot-through and a potentially damaging
current spike through your MOSFETs.  Similarly, you get shoot-through
on the right side if you call <code>lowon()</code> after calling <code>highon()</code>
without an intervening <code>off()</code>, because it brings pin 10 LOW, turning
on the P-channel MOSFET on the high side of the right side of the
H-bridge, before bringing pin 7 LOW, turning off the N-channel MOSFET
on the low side of the right side.</p>
<p>So it is very important to make sure that you don’t call these
functions without calling <code>off()</code> in between.  Furthermore, you would
like to ensure that enough time elapses in between the call to <code>off()</code>
and the subsequent function for the high-side MOSFETs to be entirely
turned off, since in general they have a small RC delay, though in
this case it’s probably less than a nanosecond.  (And for this reason,
just rewriting the <code>lowon()</code> and <code>highon()</code> functions to turn things
off before turning other things on is not necessarily adequate, though
it would probably be a good idea.)</p>
<p>You’d like to be able to encapsulate this timing safety logic in some
kind of tiny capsule of code that is small enough to be sure that it
says what you think it does, then validate that it’s called correctly
at compile-time, since after you’ve already plugged your refrigerator
into your homemade inverter, it’s too late to report a timing
constraints violation.</p>
<p>You could make this almost work in Arduino’s dialect of C++ by adding
a little bit of state and checking the current time when these
functions are called.  But what do you do when it’s too early?  You
could delay until the appropriate time, but that hangs the whole
system, which is really unfortunate if it’s doing something else like
updating an LCD.  Or you could just return without doing anything,
which would result in missing an output pulse in this case, which
might cause real problems.</p>
<p>A slightly less shitty solution would be to allocate a timer to MOSFET
control (as GreatScott does) and use it to delay the state transition
until a later time, using an ISR.  This approach doesn’t block
everything else on the device, but it does use up a timer;
generalizing this to share a timer between multiple users essentially
produces a real-time operating system.  But it doesn’t guarantee you
get the timing you asked for, just that the timing you get doesn’t
cause shoot-through and explode your MOSFETs.</p>
<p>To really encapsulate the timing constraint so that it’s not spread
across your entire codebase, you probably need some kind of theorem
prover that can prove things about function execution times.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
