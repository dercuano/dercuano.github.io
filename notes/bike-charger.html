(2 minutes)</div><p>What would it take to recharge your laptop and other electronic
devices by riding your bike?  There are highly efficient and reliable
dynohubs these days.  You could mount a small lead-acid gel cell
battery on your bike and charge it by riding.</p>
<p>A regular car or motorcyle battery holds in the tens of kJ up to MJ.
The Wikipedia article for "Car battery" says 30–40 Wh/kg, around 100
kJ/kg.  My netbook battery says:</p>
<pre><code>$ acpi -i
Battery 0: design capacity 5246 mAh, last full capacity 4518 mAh = 86%
</code></pre>
<p>It's, I think, 11 volts at the moment, which means it had about 200 kJ
when full.  So you'd need about 2kg of lead-acid battery to hold a
full recharge for it, plus some small, lightweight electronics like a
buck-boost converter to supply the laptop with the 19 volts it wants
for recharging.</p>
<p>Amazon has a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mobility-Scooter-Battery-AGM-12v-10Ah/dp/B002USEYK2">£17 lead-acid battery</a> with 10Ah at 12V, or 400kJ.
At the moment £17 is US$27.  (Typical prices seem a bit higher.)  It
weighs 3.3kg.  If everything scaled linearly, a 200kJ lead-acid
battery would weigh 1.7kg and cost US$14.</p>
<p>At a substantial cost in reliability, safety, and money, you could use
the laptop battery directly.  I think it weighs more like 500 g, but
it costs more like US$100.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/schmidt.asp">bike dynamo hub</a> like the Schmidt SON28 consumes some 2–6 W of
mechanical power, and probably has efficiency in the 80%-99% range.
Getting 200 kJ out of 4 W would require almost 14 hours of riding,
which I think of as two to four days' worth.</p>
<p>A modular display strategy would be very useful: several
cellphone-style displays would both be easier to protect against
breakage and allow scaling power usage up and down as needed.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/independence.html">Independence</a> (63 notes)
