(6 minutes)</div><p>Writing hypertext is still a pain, and an autocomplete dropdown box
from a statistically-ranked history of things you're likely to want to
link to would improve the situation dramatically.</p>
<p>Writing hypertext is still a pain, 26 years into the WWW project and
71 years after the invention of hypertext.  Typically I navigate to a
page, use ^L^C to copy the link, alt-tab to another window where I’m
writing something in Emacs (God help me if it’s in another tab of the
same browser) and type something like <code>&lt;a href="^Y"&gt;some title&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
If I want some kind of indication of what the link is, like an image
preview or something, I’m a bit out of luck in most environments,
although at least Fecebutt and Twatter are helpful there if the page
has OpenGraph metadata.</p>
<p>Consider this item from org-mode’s help file, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>org-store-link is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘org.el’.</p>
<p>It is bound to C-c l.
(org-store-link ARG)</p>
<p>Store an org-link to the current location.
This link is added to ‘org-stored-links’ and can later be inserted
into an org-buffer with C-c C-l.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds a bit saner, doesn’t it?  It’s kind of like what Flock was
trying to do in 2005 with their “shelf”, where you would put things
you were later going to link to or embed, later drag-and-dropping them
onto any random textarea.</p>
<p>Even Vannevar Bush’s 1945 UI design for linking in the “Memex” he
proposes in “<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>,” the very first proposed hypertext
system, is far less cumbersome than what I usually use at present:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this is conventional, except for the projection forward of
present-day mechanisms and gadgetry. It affords an immediate step,
however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a
provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select
immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature
of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the
important thing.</p>
<p>When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in
his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the
two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing
positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code
spaces, and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each
item. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently
joined. ...</p>
<p>Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the
other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the
corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been
thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn,
rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning
the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had
been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound
together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can
be joined into numerous trails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is another, perhaps ignored design that is currently in use for
writing hypertext documents that is substantially less clumsy:
autocomplete.  This is what Fecebutt uses for tagging people or
linking to Fecebutt pages in posts, and also what modern IDEs like
Eclipse, Jupyter, or IDEA use to help you type long function names.
You begin typing the name of an entity to link to, perhaps introduced
with a magic character like @ or something, and the system instantly
consults a dictionary of possible link targets, orders the possible
completions (maybe including possible errors!) by likelihood, and
displays the top few in a drop-down list right next to where you’re
typing, each accompanied with some kind of preview.</p>
<p>Of course you could use the same approach to actually navigate to
possible link targets, and then use a Memex-style link-creation button
to link one thing you’re looking at (or typing) to the thing you just
navigated to.  But I think this is less fluid than the
dropdown/autocomplete approach.</p>
<p>Ideally, you wouldn’t need to explicitly add things one by one to the
list of possible link targets; instead, merely visiting them or
even seeing a link to them drift by on Twatter would add them to the
set of relevant links.  You’d have to compensate for the large volume
of possibly relevant links by having a reasonably accurate statistical
ranking of which things are most likely to be linked to at any given
time and for a given “search string”; also, searching through your
own, perhaps private, commentary on a link, and that of your friends,
should provide additional clues as to which tags are most relevant to
a link.</p>
<p>This isn’t quite enough for transclusion or quoting, because that is
going to require some explicit user action to indicate the extent of
the text, pixel data, etc., to be quoted.  I think that probably the
right solution there is to use an annotation UI to attach marginal
notes to highlighted passages, then use tags and titles included in
the marginal notes, as well as the contents of the highlighted
passage, to feed the search engine.  The persistent identity of a link
target in this system might become a tricky question as existing
works are modified.</p>
<p>Note that a single web page might contain many possible link targets,
even without transclusion — for example, one for each header in a long
article.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/hci.html">Human–computer interaction</a> (76 notes)
