(3 minutes)</div><p>Suppose we have this scrap of code:</p>
<pre><code>f = buxus.open(buxus_filename)
viewport = f.bbox()
canvas = buxcanvas.create(viewport)
</code></pre>
<p>There are lots of ways to read this gobbet of code, but one of them is
as a rule which, given values for <code>buxus</code>, <code>buxus_filename</code>, and
<code>buxcanvas</code>, can produce values for <code>f</code>, <code>viewport</code>, and <code>canvas</code>.  Or
possibly fail to.</p>
<p>Or consider these two lines of code separately:</p>
<pre><code>interval_size_log = math.log(stop) - math.log(start)
</code></pre>
<p>That gives us a rule to compute <code>interval_size_log</code> given values for
<code>stop</code>, <code>start</code>, and <code>math</code>.</p>
<pre><code>n_divisions = int(math.ceil(interval_size_log / math.log(1 + spacing)))
</code></pre>
<p>That gives us a rule to compute <code>n_divisions</code> given values for <code>int</code>,
<code>math</code>, <code>interval_size_log</code>, and <code>spacing</code>.  This rule chains nicely
with the previous one, which provides <code>interval_size_log</code>.</p>
<p>If you were going to apply this approach in a general way to large
programs, you’d need some way to namespace these names, of course.
And you need some kind of subroutine call mechanism.</p>
<p>In Python 3.3 and later, you can supply a custom mapping to <code>exec</code>
that logs these accesses as they happen.  So you can really write
these just as little gobbets of Python code.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for how such a soup of code gobbets could be
useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditional computation.  Given the knowledge that
  <code>interval_size_log</code> depends on <code>stop</code>, <code>start</code>, and <code>math</code> (or, more
  pleasantly, <code>log</code>) you can efficiently compute all the
  <code>interval_size_log</code> values for a range of <code>stop</code> values, a range of
  <code>start</code> values, corresponding sets of <code>stop</code> and <code>start</code> values
  (depending, for example, on some index <code>i</code>), or independently
  varying sets of <code>stop</code> and <code>start</code> values.</li>
</ul>
<p>This becomes more powerful if you add quantifiers and aggregation,
  although it is not clear to me how this should work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Incremental recomputation, although of course this requires you to
  make your changes to variables rather than down inside of data
  structures somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transactions.  You can run an arbitrary piece of code that runs in
  an environment where the variables it reads and writes are
  monitored, and only commit its writes if none of the variables it
  read have been changed by a previously committed transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inference systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hot code reloading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lazy computation — although you do have to try to run each gobbet at
  least once to see what it might produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pattern matching.  You can provide different possible ways to
  compute the same variable, given different possible inputs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For many of these applications, you could have a subroutine call
mechanism that works by putting some parameters into a new namespace
and then trying to pull things out of it.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>isl = ns(start=1, stop=20).interval_size_log
</code></pre>
<p>Something like that might be the way to handle quantifiers and
aggregation, too.  Instead of saying, "What if start=1?" you’re saying
“What if start is any value in range(10)?”  But then of course if you
are going to get a scalar value out of it at the end you need to
specify how you are going to aggregate the pointwise values.</p>
