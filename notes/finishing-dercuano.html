<p>Today is the day I'm finishing Dercuano, or, perhaps, giving up on it.
I could of course continue to add stuff to it indefinitely, but I want
it to have a definite, unambiguous publication year, and there's only
one day left in the year, plus a few hours.  I slept six hours this
afternoon after pulling an all-nighter.  I want to get it done tonight
so that the publication year doesn't depend on your timezone.</p>
<p>Goaded by John Cowan,
I've spent the last week hacking together <a href="https://gitlab.com/kragen/dercuano/blob/master/genpdf.py">a terrible piece of shit
that renders a pile of HTML to a PDF file for reading on hand
computers</a>, as described in <a href="../notes/dercuano-hand-computers.html">How to make Dercuano work on hand computers?</a>.  The
result is considerably more readable than the output of a one-week
HTML-rendering hack has any right to be, and in many ways it's much
more readable than the PDF output of browsers: it has better margins,
its font sizes are more readable on hand computers, and links are
annotated with page numbers so you can follow them (with about 15
seconds of effort, in hallway user testing) even if your PDF viewer
doesn't support links, as Google Drive's PDF viewer doesn't.</p>
<p>There are lots of things I wanted to add to both Dercuano and its PDF
rendering that I haven't managed to: dynamic models, 3-D models,
drawings, diagrams, decent formula display, and so on, not to mention
an endless variety of ideas I hoped to explore further.  Some of these
things are in fact present in Dercuano itself, but missing from the
HTML rendering.  <a href="../notes/parabolic-optimization.html">Rediscovering successive parabolic interpolation: derivative-free optimization of scalar functions by fitting a parabola</a> has a calculation form
that doesn't work in PDF.  <a href="../notes/mechano-optical-vector-display.html">A mechano-optical vector display for animation archival</a> and
<a href="../notes/dercuano-drawings.html">Dercuano drawings</a> contain SVG graphics, but I haven't
implemented an SVG renderer, so they're not in the PDF version.
<em>Lots</em> of notes contain tables which I went to the trouble of
converting to HTML, but I haven't implemented HTML tables in my PDF
renderer (whose layout model is impossibly simpleminded) and so
they're only barely preserved; most of them are comprehensible, while
a few aren't.  This is what happens when you hack together an HTML
renderer in a week.</p>
<p>I suppose no plans are realized completely, so when it's too late to
pursue them further, they all end with some regret.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I can rest easy knowing that all of this foofaraw has
been <em>Published</em> --- not in the peer-reviewed-research sense, but in
the sense of being made public, and therefore probably being able to
survive the inevitable and fairly imminent death of this body, as well
as serving as prior art ("printed material") for patent purposes.</p>
<p>So, what will this body do next?  After all, it's extremely improbable
that it will die in the next two days.  Will there be a "Derctuwo"?</p>
<p>I don't know.  I think I'd like to write something that has a little
more of the nature of a Jupyter notebook and can include a lot of
colorful illustrations, and that realizes some of the aspirations in
<a href="../notes/book-in-itself.html">The book written in itself</a>.</p>
<h2>Ideas I'm just now getting around to writing down</h2>
<p>Here are some things I might have written full notes about if I'd
gotten around to it.</p>
<p>Could you move things around a multitouch acoustic panel, as described
in <a href="../notes/audio-tablet.html">Audio tablet</a>, using ultrasound, vibrating it under them?</p>
<p>Can you get mobile browsers to open <code>data:</code> URLs embedded in QR codes?
Can you gzip the contents?  Can you stick HTML with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> or SVG
into those files?</p>
<p>Normal build systems like <code>make</code> are pretty much theorem provers, but
they generally only handle monotonic logics: no build artifact is
conditional on the <em>absence</em> of another build artifact, just its
presence.  But suppose you made a build artifact depend on the result
of a query; adding new assertions to the database could change the
result of the query and thus trigger a rebuild.  This could, for
example, cause Dercuano to build a new version of an HTML file if a
note gained new topics.</p>
<p>Can you get haptic feedback for piano keys using magnetic braking?
Normally piano keys move heavy hammers which have a large mechanical
advantage; can you replicate that with magnetic brakes?</p>
<p>In things like <a href="../notes/principled-apl.html">A principled rethinking of array languages like APL</a> I considered something similar to
normal APL syntax, so <code>X×Y</code> would multiply <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> elementwise,
but to sum it you would need <code>+/X×Y</code>, meaning <code>+/(X×Y)</code>.  For an
exploratory data analysis UI, this is kind of a suboptimal sequence:
<code>+/X</code> is usually not a good first approximation to <code>+/X×Y</code>.  Usually
you start with <code>X×Y</code> and then reduce it, so a postfix <code>.sum()</code> (with
some kind of syntax) is probably better.</p>
<p>Can you get better efficiency in floating point by sharing the same
exponent among a group of mantissas, perhaps using some kind of CPU
fault to trigger an exponent change?</p>
<p>Can you build a really simple and cheap spectrum analyzer with a
wide-range VCO, a mixer, and an STM32 that can digitize half a
megahertz of bandwidth at any given time?</p>
<p>The usual implementation of a priority queue uses a binary heap, but
what if you keep the top, say, 8 items insertion-sorted in an array
instead?  Or the top up-to-8 items?  Maybe that would give you better
constant factors than always using a binary heap.</p>
<p>This netbook, like many old netbooks, runs on 14 volts.  How hard
would it be to generate 14 volts at the 800 mW or so it needs with a
boost converter from a USB power pack?</p>
<p>The standard Android lockscreen snaps your finger's path to a number
of grid points in order to discretize it and thus make it possible to
accept or reject a passcode attempt.  Hofstadter's "gridfonts" are
similarly discretized and are aesthetically interesting letterforms;
could such an interface be an interesting way to draw gridfont
letterforms?</p>
<p>The sinc tails of a brickwall bandpass filter's impulse response are
full of beating (a "carrier frequency" amplitude-modulated by a lower
"beat frequency"; the "beat frequency" here is the oscillating tail of
the sinc that is the inverse Fourier transform of the rectangular
passband in the frequency domain, while the "carrier frequency" is its
offset from zero, which is an impulse in the frequency domain that's
been convolved with that pulse to shift it away from zero, and thus is
multiplied by it in the frequency domain).  Such beating also arises
by adding two oscillations of different pure frequencies.  Can you
somehow make a filter that somehow approximates these tails by adding
together sinusoidal time-domain responses?</p>
<p>Evince (the PDF etc. viewer) remembers where it is in files by
filename.  This means that if you rename a file, for example to have a
name other than '3280523.pdf' or 'thesis.pdf', it forgets where it
was.  The same is true of, for example, F-Droid's Document Viewer.
Maybe it would be better to use the file size plus some checksums of
some byte-ranges of the file, rather than the file's name.</p>
<p>How would you make a composite material to resist abrasion?  Making it
very hard is of course a useful element, but perhaps it's even better
to mix very hard flakes with a gummy binder that deforms plastically
instead of splitting off.  Hardened steel works this way, for example,
as does road asphalt, but you could use many other materials.</p>
<p>A backpack needs to resist a number of different failure modes:
ultraviolet degradation, water penetration (if it gets soaked and
everything inside is destroyed by the water, the backpack has failed,
abrasion, failure by tensile stress, and the zipper wearing out or
otherwise failing.  You could imagine a backpack with different layers
for these different failure modes; UHMWPE fiber is great at resisting
tension, for example, but sucks at resisting ultraviolet, so a layer
on top of the UHMWPE fiber that protects it from light would be
useful, and some hard bosses (metal or whatever) could prevent
abrasion from reaching the softer fabrics.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/dercuano.html">Dercuano</a> (17 notes)
