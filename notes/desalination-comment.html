(3 minutes)</div><p>(A comment I made on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12191089">an article on the orange
website</a>.)</p>
<p>There are some crucial details here I'm not understanding.</p>
<p>The article says Israel needs (or needed?) 1.9Gm³/year (60 kiloliters
per second, 60kℓ/s) of water, of which it got 1.5Gm³/year (48kℓ/s)
from natural sources; but now (or when the plants opened?) it gets
127Mm³/year from the 2005 Ashkelon desal plant, 140Mm³/year from the
2009 Hadera desal plant, and 150Mm³/year from the new Sorek plant.
These total 417Mm³/year (13kℓ/s), but the article says Israel's
current total is 600Mm³/year (19kℓ/s) from desalination plants, which
is more than 417.  Also, it says, Israel now gets 55% of its domestic
water from desalination.  But 55% of 60kℓ/s is 33kℓ/s, which is 14kℓ/s
more than the 19kℓ/s it says Israel gets from desalination.  I suspect
there's some confusing mixing of categories here leading to these
numbers not adding up properly.</p>
<p>The other really crucial questions are about capex and opex.  How much
do these plants cost to build, and how much do they cost to run?  How
much of that is the energy cost?</p>
<p>They give the figure that the Sorek plant's reverse osmosis runs at 70
atmospheres (7.1 MPa; fucking Christ on a stick, why do people keep
inventing new non-SI units?) which means that each liter of output
water requires 7.1kJ of mechanical energy to force it through the
membrane.  There are presumably some other energy costs, but that may
be the bulk of it.  At US$100/MWh (US$28/GJ; fucking non-SI units
again), which is a reasonable ballpark for the levelized cost of
electrical energy, that's about 200 μUS$/ℓ or 200 US$/Mℓ.  Irrigation
water is commonly quoted in US$ per acre foot in the US; this is
US$240 per acre foot, which would be a very competitive cost.</p>
<p>But it says the cost is US$0.58/kℓ, which is 580 US$/Mℓ or US$715/acre
foot, about three times the cost of the mechanical energy and high
enough that many crops are uneconomical.  It is crucial to understand
where that extra cost is coming from.</p>
<p>One of the comments on the Ensia version of the story claims that the
new Carlsbad desal plant is selling its water for US$2000/acre foot.
I don't know if that's true, but it's about 150% higher than the
projected costs.</p>
