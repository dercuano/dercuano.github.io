(11 minutes)</div><p>Generally speaking, the REST constraints that requests and responses
be fully self-describing and that servers be stateless makes REST
protocols fairly bandwidth-intensive, not suitable for low-bandwidth
links (in the range of 0.001–10000 bits per second).  This is actually
cited as one of the drawbacks of REST in Fielding’s dissertation.  But
there is an approach fully within the spirit of REST that can fix
this.</p>
<h2>Inspirational examples from HTTP</h2>
<p>A web server wants a web browser to display a page with some inline
images.  So it sends the browser some HTML containing the URLs of the
images.  The HTML is interpreted in the context of that connection,
allowing the server to use short “relative URLs” to refer to the
images.  If the browser already has the images, it can avoid fetching
them again (according to a caching policy which may have many factors,
including commitments made by the server about image changes and
demands made by the user about freshness) and thus use very little
bandwidth.  Or, if the connection is using HTTP/2 or SPDY, the server
has the option to “push” the images to the browser before they are
requested, if it thinks the bandwidth cost is worth the potential
improvement in latency.</p>
<p>A web browser wants eBay’s web server to add a product image to an
image a user is listing on eBay.  Rather than sending the image data,
it sends an URL to an imgur image, thus using very little bandwidth.</p>
<h2>The generalization of the inspirational examples: including by reference, context-sensitive abbreviation, caching</h2>
<p>These are two examples of a more general mechanism for enabling the
REST architecture to work well even for applications with very
stringent bandwidth constraints.  Specifically, any large chunk of
data is made into a separate resource and <em>included by reference</em>
rather than inlined; the references are <em>abbreviated in a
context-sensitive way</em> according to the context of the connection; and
the chunks of data are then <em>cached</em> so that they need not be fetched
every time.</p>
<p>You could argue that allowing the client to use context-sensitive
abbreviations in its request amounts to requiring the server to
maintain session state, a violation of REST.  But as long as this
abbreviation layer is a layer below the requests and responses, it
affects the protocol semantics no more than the RFC3749 data
compression that used to be a feature of TLS before the CRIME and
BREACH attacks were discovered.</p>
<p>The crucial properties are that any request message that would be
valid on one connection at some time is also valid on a newly opened
connection at that time, even if its on-the-wire representation might
need to use more bytes, that the amount of abbreviation state is
small, and that the client knows the entire session state to be able
to tell the server in a new conneciton if necessary.  This largely
preserves the advantages of the client-stateless-server style REST
derives from: visibility is preserved because a monitoring system can
easily maintain the abbreviation state, partial failures (of a server)
are no more difficult to recover from, and the server is free to close
connections to free up resources whenever desired.</p>
<h2>A database query example, starting with HTTP</h2>
<p>For example, suppose you want to run a query against a large database
and fetch some of the results.  You could send a request like this
(newlines added for clarity):</p>
<pre><code>GET http://elephant-server/walrusdb/v18032
    ?q=select+*+from+walruses+where[2000 bytes omitted]order+by+size
    &amp;p=1&amp;n=10
</code></pre>
<p>to fetch 10-item page 1 of the results of a 2000-character query,
evaluated on immutable snapshot 18032 of some walrus database.  This
is a workable interface, but inefficient, because every page of
results is going to involve a 2100-byte request.  Suppose instead that
you could say this:</p>
<pre><code>GET http://elephant-server/walrusdb/v18032
    ?q=https://pastebin.com/raw/FhnZFrGN
    &amp;p=1&amp;n=10
</code></pre>
<p>This gets us down to 90 bytes, a 23-fold improvement.  If the server
doesn’t have a valid cached version of the query, it can go fetch it
from Pastebin and cache it.  (Pastebin marks it as cacheable for 1801
seconds.)  What’s more, the server can cache the query plan and even
query results as long as that cache item is valid — and the cache key
is only 34 bytes.</p>
<p>If at some point the server decides to evict the query from its cache,
this is transparent to the client.</p>
<h2>Departing a bit from HTTP</h2>
<p>But we can do better.  First, note that in real, non-proxied HTTP/1.0,
we didn’t actually say</p>
<pre><code>GET http://elephant-server/wa...
</code></pre>
<p>because we allowed the connection context to determine the scheme and
host/port parts of the URL.  Instead, we said</p>
<pre><code>GET /wa...
</code></pre>
<p>substantially abbreviating the URL.  Later on, because of the IPv4
address shortage, we decided that it was better to put it back in, and
so we ended up with this as a backwards-compatible hack:</p>
<pre><code>GET /wa...
Host: elephant-server
</code></pre>
<p>And, later still, TLS gained SNI, which would in theory allow us to
take the “Host:” header back out.  In fact, maybe HTTP/2 did.  I don’t
know.</p>
<p>Anyway, suppose that we use some kind of escape sequence to represent
base URLs, and that each request includes the base URL it’s for, and
that there's a separate kind of request line that defines such an
escape sequence.  If we use “$” for clarity, rather than the perhaps
more realistic choice of some kind of unprintable character, we end up
with this:</p>
<pre><code>$s=http://elephant-server/walrusdb/v18032
$p=https://pastebin.com/raw/
get $s?q=$p/FhnZFrGN&amp;p=1&amp;n=10
</code></pre>
<p>So now, at the cost of 71 extra bytes at connection establishment
time, each of our requests is down to 30 bytes.</p>
<p>Involving Pastebin is kind of shitty, though.  Your queries are
public, Pastebin can alter them as they wish, they are identified by
8-letter strings, and it may take you a long time to upload them there
even if the server doesn’t use them.  It would be much better if the
client of the query processor could simply be the server for when the
query processor wants to fetch the query; then it could allocate
resource identifiers as it sees fit, reducing them down to perhaps two
letters or digits until it gets over about 3700 of them.</p>
<p>You could do that with connection-specific resource identifiers, but
that’s kind of suboptimal because then a connection loss and
reconnection invalidates the server’s cache.  A better approach is for
the client to generate a session signing key and sign the responses
with it.  Then it only needs an abbreviation for its public key or a
hash thereof.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>$s=http://elephant-server/walrusdb/v18032
$p=dat://12c09257a5f9320fb00b769bf6b68b17fee5c33a1b6c89b723941a06e7c7b19e/
ihave $p
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=1&amp;n=10
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have 126 bytes of setup, but we’re down to 24 bytes per
request, 20% less, with no external servers or non-end-to-end
encryption involved, without losing connection-to-connection
cacheability.</p>
<p>24 bytes per request is little enough that it would be usable over a
300-baud modem — although the response might be unpleasantly large,
depending on how the response is structured.</p>
<h2>Attempts at tighter encoding: CoAP (fail)</h2>
<p>You could try to do better than 24 bytes.  For example, CoAP tries to
provide a tighter encoding of HTTP-like semantics, but without
requiring a reliable connection-oriented protocol underneath.  It
isn’t successful in this case:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import aiocoap
&gt;&gt;&gt; req = aiocoap.Message(code=aiocoap.GET, mtype=aiocoap.CON, mid=1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; req.opt.uri_path = ('$s',)
&gt;&gt;&gt; req.opt.uri_query = ('q=$p/2q', 'p=1', 'n=10')
&gt;&gt;&gt; req.encode()
b'@\x01\x00\x01\xb2$sGq=$p/2q\x03p=1\x04n=10'
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(_)
24
</code></pre>
<p>What it buys us is that the message-id and the request for
confirmation are bundled into the first four bytes along with the GET.
(GET itself is represented by the second byte being 0x01; 0x02 is
POST, 0x03 PUT, and 0x04 DELETE; 0x45 'E' is the most common
equivalent of HTTP 200 OK, while for example 0x84 is 4.04 Not Found.)</p>
<h2>Attempts at tighter encoding: ncompress and gzip (these help)</h2>
<p>ncompress implements LZW and has very little overhead and almost no
codec latency.  The following file contains 10 requests and, without
compression, is 367 bytes, including 126 bytes of initial setup.</p>
<pre><code>$s=http://elephant-server/walrusdb/v18032
$p=dat://12c09257a5f9320fb00b769bf6b68b17fee5c33a1b6c89b723941a06e7c7b19e/
ihave $p
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=1&amp;n=10
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=2&amp;n=10
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=3&amp;n=10
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=4&amp;n=10
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=5&amp;n=10
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=6&amp;n=10
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=7&amp;n=10
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=8&amp;n=10
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=9&amp;n=10
get $s?q=$p/2q&amp;p=10&amp;n=10
</code></pre>
<p>This works out to 36.7 bytes per request.  ncompress reduces it to 241
bytes, or 24 bytes per request; the initial setup was inflated to 135
bytes, but the marginal cost per request was then just 10.6 bytes.</p>
<p>By comparison, if we rely only on ncompress with no other
abbreviations, we could try this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Uncompressed, this is 1359 bytes.  Compressed with ncompress, it is
626 bytes.  We can conclude that ncompress is not an adequate
replacement for the abbreviation system.</p>
<p>What about LZ77?  With gzip -9, this same file compresses to 168
bytes, 16.8 bytes per request, the best showing so far.  However,
that’s relying somewhat on a certain amount of cross-request
compression.  Flushing the compressor after every line brings the
compressed size up to 266 bytes — 26.6 bytes per request.  We can
conclude that gzip is a nearly identically performing replacement for
the abbreviation system.</p>
<p>Why not both?  gzip -9 reduces the abbreviated 367-byte version we
started with to 171 bytes, or 17.1 bytes per request; 127 bytes of
this is the initial setup, leaving only 4.4 incremental bytes per
request thereafter.  However, if we flush every line, it’s even worse
than before — up to 283 bytes.</p>
<h2>Clients composing things from pieces on the server or out in the world</h2>
<p>Suppose the server you’re talking to supports constructing some kind
of filesystem environment to run programs in.  You tell it what the
filesystem looks like (with a list of Docker-like layers or a
Git-style tree hash or whatever) and it downloads whatever files it’s
missing.</p>
<p>Suppose the files are mapped to resources on the network.  Now you can
build your filesystem environment from references to files that are
located on the server itself, if it happens to also be a fileserver,
but also on other servers near it, as well as files you yourself have.
And you can do all of this without making the server responsible for
maintaining that state in any kind of long term.  You just need some
kind of naming system for the resources.</p>
