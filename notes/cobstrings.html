(5 minutes)</div><p>COBS ("consistent overhead byte stuffing") is a byte-stuffing method
for avoiding NUL bytes in your packets so that you can use them for
framing which has some interesting virtues.  You take your packet</p>
<pre><code>f o o\0\0\1\0 x y z\0\7
</code></pre>
<p>append a NUL to it so that it's a concatenation of NUL-terminated
strings, then compute the lengths of all the NUL-terminated strings:</p>
<pre><code>f o o\0\0\1\0 x y z\0\7\0
3       0 1   3       1
</code></pre>
<p>Now you convert the NUL-terminated strings to counted strings with the
counts starting at 1.</p>
<pre><code>f o o\0\0\1\0 x y z\0\7\0
3       0 1   3       1
\4f o o\1\2\1\4 x y z\2\7
</code></pre>
<p>So now your packet is the same length as before but contains no NULs,
if we count the terminating NUL we added, through a reversible
transformation that eliminates the NULs.</p>
<p>But that's impossible, by the same pigeonhole principle that shows
that file compression has its limits.  And indeed we run into the
standard problem with counted strings: you run out of counts.  What do
you do if you have more than 254 bytes between NULs?</p>
<p>COBS solves this by reserving \xff for a 254-payload-byte prefix
block, which does not have a terminating NUL; so a COBS string in
general consists of a sequence of zero or more \xff-prefixed blocks
followed by an excess-1-count-prefixed block, which may be empty.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that this representation for in-memory strings has
some advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Like C strings, it only requires a single extra byte of overhead,
   at least in the cases where C strings are a good idea.</li>
<li>Like C strings, you can cut a string into tokens in place by
   overwriting separators in it with metadata.  (This requires
   moving around later parts of the string if it's long, though.)</li>
<li>Unlike C strings, it's 8-bit clean; it can store any byte,
   including NUL bytes, avoiding security holes, among other problems.
   This means COBS strings can be safely nested!</li>
<li>Unlike C strings, appending to a long string (of a few kilobytes)
   is reasonably efficient, as is taking its length; so <code>stpcpy</code> is
   unnecessary.  And Boyer-Moore search is plausible.</li>
<li>Unlike C strings, you can copy it several bytes at a time.</li>
</ol>
<p>It has a couple of disadvantages compared to C strings: code
implementing fundamental string operations is a bit more complicated;
you can't compute a suffix of a string without mutating it, which
means that a number of standard library functions need an extra "start
index" argument; and copying data into and out of the string requires
special consideration for possible chunk boundaries.</p>
<p>Here, I'm eliminating as unhelpful in this context the constraint to
not use NUL bytes, so a \0 length byte is an empty string, a \1 length
byte is a single-byte string, a \xfe byte is a 254-byte string, and
the \xff byte prefixes 255 bytes of payload data.</p>
<p>So a long string might look like this in memory:</p>
<pre><code>FF C O B S ( " c ... s oSPFF t h a t ... s t a rFF t i
 n g...SPSPBE / * c o bSP c h u n k ... \nSPSPSPSP}\n
</code></pre>
<p>with the \xBE at the beginning of the final block both signaling its
length and </p>
<p>I think these functions may be correct, but I have not tested them.</p>
