(11 minutes)</div><p>Microlens arrays for 4D lightfield displays are now being shown
publicly — more or less, a brute-force realization of “holographic
displays”.  Essentially, this is garden-variety lenticular 3D, but
with a computer screen rather than a printed image behind the lenses.
But this places new demands on the underlying screen resolution.  To
reliably get human binocular vision at a distance of one meter, I
think you need new images every 50 milliradians, half the distance
between human eyes.  With two dimensions of parallax and a radian or
so of viewing angle, this works out to a few hundred images, let’s say
256.  For a 512×384 image, which I think is what the original
Macintosh had, that means you need 50 megapixels.</p>
<p>(As a point of comparison, Thomas Burnett’s FOVI3D display displays a
180×180 image with 50×50 viewing angles across 90° (10π milliradians),
for a total of 81 megapixels, using 20 4K OLEDs tiled without very
good brightness correction; another model uses 108 megapixels.  He’s
doping all the pixels to yellow-green to get spatial resolution and
brightness at the expense of color.)</p>
<p>It’s challenging to fabricate so many pixels.  One possible solution
is to temporally multiplex a smaller number of pixels, scanning each
pixel over a significant area with a vibrating or rotating mirror.
DLP and inorganic LED pixels are capable of response times
sufficiently fast to make this a viable option; LCD, CRT, and plasma
pixels are not.  DLP pixels are too close together, though, which
leaves inorganic LED pixels as the only option.  I’m going to consider
only monochrome displays for now.</p>
<p>Doing this kind of thing with a vibrating or rotating mirror requires
some kind of scanning pattern that scans the (image of the) physical
pixel over all the spatial locations it’s responsible for
illuminating; the traditional approach from analog TV is a pair of
sawtooth signals, a slow one (≈60Hz) for Y and a fast one (≈15kHz,
with important harmonics up to, say, 105kHz) for X.  Other scan
patterns, such as Lissajous, are possible but do not remove the
necessity for a rather high scanning speed in one dimension.</p>
<p>Vibrating or spinning a mirror at low speed is much easier than
vibrating a mirror at high speed, especially if the mirror is large.
Consider a small area of 393 216 spatial locations — this could be 512
lines of 768 spatial locations, 768 lines of 512 spatial locations,
128 lines of 3072 spatial locations, 48 lines of 8192 spatial
locations, and so on.  In the last case, supposing the Y dimension is
scanned at 60 Hz, the X dimension will need to be scanned at 2880 Hz,
which is considerably less demanding than 15kHz.  At some cost in
effective resolution and complexity of brightness control, you can use
a sinusoidal scan for the X, avoiding the need for responsivity at
higher harmonics such as 8640 Hz.  Alternatively, you could use a
spinning mirror such as those used in supermarket scanners and laser
printers; a hexagonal mirror would give you a 2880 Hz scan at 480Hz or
28’800 rpm, which is challenging but feasible.</p>
<p>That is for a single LED; you need to position it at least 48 LED
heights above the next LED below.</p>
<p>Ideally you’d like to be able to change all 50 megapixels for each
frame, but even without that ability, you can make the display work
for less-frequently-updated images.  For example, you could assign a
microcontroller to each 8192×48 area (512×3 macropixels), which it
would have to refresh at least 60 times a second: 23’592’960 pixel
outputs per second.  This is within the capability of STM32F
microcontrollers, which cost 59¢.  Moreover, they can control 16 lines
at a time at this speed, so a single microcontroller (and perhaps
three associated 40¢ ULN2003 seven-Darlington low-side switching
chips) can control a 8192×768 area (512×48 macropixels).  Eight such
microcontrollers would suffice for the whole 6144×8192 display
(512×384 macropixels), with a total BOM cost of US$14.32 for the
silicon, not counting the 128 tiny LEDs and 128 resistors, and
actually wasting a bunch of the Darlingtons.</p>
<p>However, an STM32F0 microcontroller typically only has 4K of RAM.
Rather than economizing so much on microcontrollers, it might make
more sense to economize on mirror X scanning.  For example, if we use
64 microcontrollers instead of 8, with 16 LEDs per microcontroller, we
can control 1024 LEDs via 147 ULN2003s, and each LED only needs to
cover an 8192×6 area rather than 8192×48, so the X scan on the mirror
can slow from 2880 Hz (28’800 rpm with a hexagonal mirror) to 360 Hz
(3600 rpm), which is much easier to achieve.  Moreover, the signal to
each LED need only change at 2’949’120 Hz rather than 24 MHz — this
still poses signal integrity challenges but is dramatically simpler.
You need 147 ULN2003s and 64 STMF0s, for a silicon BOM cost of $96.56.</p>
<p>(I should check the ULN2003 datasheet to see if it can handle a 3MHz
or 24MHz signal.)</p>
<p>Note that this still only leaves you with 256K of RAM to hold the data
to display on a 6144×8192 display, i.e. 192 pixels per byte.  I think
there are some items in the STM32 line with more RAM, up to 2
megabytes per chip.  DRAM would likely be fast enough.  Also, external
RAM chips with their data lines connected to the driver inputs might
work, as long as the drivers have a disable input.  But it might be
adequate to generate a single 8-kilobit scan line (1 kilobyte) on each
scan, starting with some kind of heightfield model or something that
you could reasonably rasterize a line of in 48MHz/360Hz = 133’333
32-bit CPU cycles.</p>
<p>By using the double-parabolic mirror trick used for the famous
floating coin illusion, you can cause the microlens-array-generated
lightfield image to appear to float in midair instead.</p>
<p>If we wanted to reduce this approach to an absolute minimum demoable
product, maybe we could start with something the size of an 80×25
terminal with a narrow viewing angle.  Let’s say 80×5 = 160
macropixels horizontally and 25×8 = 200 macropixels vertically.  And
let’s say we are willing to accept fewer viewing angles: 8
horizontally and 4 vertically, for example.  And let’s lower the
refresh rate to a cinema-flickery 24Hz.  And let’s use a mirror that
only scans in one dimension, horizontally.  Now we need 800 fricking
LEDs, but we can probably multiplex them a bit, because the whole
matrix is only 1280×800, so we only need 61'440'000 pixels out per
second, or 3'840'000 16-bit updates per second.  If you run 32 of the
LEDs at any given time using 5 ULN2003s, you can use 25 high-side
switches (what are these called?) in, say, 4 chips.  To get these 57
GPIOs you might need, say, four microcontrollers, with very lax
constraints on their output timing.  This works out to 13 chips that
collectively cost US$6.  The 800 fricking LEDs may cost more than
that, but probably not more than US$16.</p>
<p>The optics may be somewhat more of a problem.  You only need 24Hz
scanning (240 rpm) and possibly some kind of magnification in order to
be able to use a manageably small scan mirror.</p>
<p>You might really want RGB LEDs and multiple brightness levels, which,
at these speeds, are probably best achieved by linearly controlling
current sources rather than PWM.  These are probably achievable but
may be difficult.</p>
<h2>To investigate</h2>
<ul>
<li>ULN2003 speed: Is 3MHz OK?  24MHz?  The ULN2803A datasheet (the one
  with 8 Darlingtons instead of 7) says 130 ns propagation delay low
  to high, 20 ns high to low, which suggests it ought to be able to
  make it up to about 6MHz, but the ULN2003A gives a max of 1 μs for
  each of these, suggesting a limit of 500kHz, despite a typical
  propagation delay of 250 ns (thus 2MHz).</li>
<li>Does the ULN2003 have chip enable?  No.</li>
<li>What’s the high-side equivalent of the ULN2003?  There used to be a
  UDN2891 but it’s obsolete.  As a sort of replacement, TI has come
  out with the US$1.81 TLC59123 and TLC59123A 8-input 500mA 13.2V
  latching synchronous high-side drivers, which claims it can only be
  clocked up to 1 MHz.  It doesn’t have a chip enable either.  It also
  has 100–200 ns propagation delays, and requires clock pulses of at
  least 100ns, so you would think it ought to be able to do several
  MHz.  There are other alternatives, like the US$2.52 Allegro A2982
  (8 parallel 50V 500mA high-side drivers, but up to 10μs turnoff
  delay).</li>
<li>Is PSRAM fast enough for framebuffers?  The US$3.20 ISSI
  IS55WV51216EBLL-55TLI 8-megabit 16-bit-parallel 44-pin TSSOP PSRAM
  claims 55 nanoseconds, which is plenty fast enough, though the
  datasheet only claims 60ns; the US$2.10 ISSI IS62C1024AL-35QLI-TR is
  a 128K × 8 (1-megabit) real SRAM 32-SOP that claims 35ns.</li>
<li>original Macintosh screen size: 512×384?  No, 512×342.</li>
<li>How much do SMD LEDs cost?  How small do they come?  4.0¢ in metric
  1608 packages (archaic 0603) in quantity 1000.  These are the Rohm
  SML-D12x1 series, which come in five colors: V and U reds (630 and
  620 nm), D orange (605 nm), Y yellow (590 nm), and M yellowish green
  (572 nm).  They can withstand 100mA peak current (at 10% duty cycle
  1kHz), 20mA continuous current, and 54mW power dissipation, with
  respectively 40, 63, 100, 100, and 30 millicandelas at 20mA.  They
  drop 1.7–2.2 V.  The Lite-On LTST-C191KGKT, another archaic 0603,
  costs 6.0¢; these can handle 30mA continuous, 80mA peak, and 75mW
  dissipation, and claim a max of 71 mcd at 20 mA instead of 30.
  These are binned by brightness and color.  (But the min is only 18.)
  These LEDs (both types) turn off after dropping by about 200 mV;
  neither specifies a junction capacitance or response time in its
  datasheet.</li>
