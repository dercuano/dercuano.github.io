(7 minutes)</div><p>In theory, with ideal design, the functionality of a piece of software
grows exponentially with the amount of code in it: each new piece of
code can take advantage of the entire existing set of capabilities,
and so adding a line of code to a system adds capabilities
proportional to those of the previous codebase.</p>
<p>In practice, this never happens.  In a few hundred or a few thousand
lines of code, we can write a hypertext system, or a ray tracer, or a
full-text search engine, or a filesystem, or an operating-system
kernel, or an interpreter or compiler for a high-level language, or a
GUI, or a networking protocol, and so on.  Naively extrapolating, we
would expect that in a hundred thousand lines of code, you could go
far beyond these capabilities, into things that seem like utterly
alien technology — let alone what you could do in a million or ten
million lines of code.</p>
<p>You could surely argue that this is somewhat ill-founded: it isn’t
clear how to reduce “amount of functionality” to a scalar quantity.
But in fact, regardless of how you choose to define it, it’s clear
that this isn’t happening: our existing computing systems routinely
contain millions of lines of code, and rather than seeming like alien
technology from the future, they often fail to work at all, and when
they do, they often barely work.</p>
<p>Also in theory, the difficulty of writing a piece of software
incrementally, piece by piece, should be proportional to the square of
the amount of code in it, because the number of potential pairwise
interactions between lines of code increases proportional to that
square.  This is often cited when hackers try to convince one another
of the merits of simplicity.</p>
<p>In practice, however, the observed exponent seems to be around 1.05
per thousand lines of code: the basic COCOMO model estimates
development effort at 2.4 person-months per KSLOC**1.05.  So:</p>
<ul>
<li>a thousand-line project should take 2.4 person-months (410 lines of
  code per person-month), while</li>
<li>a ten-thousand-line project should take 27 person-months (370 lines
  of code per person-month),</li>
<li>a hundred-thousand-line project should take 302 person-months
  (330 lines of code per person-month),</li>
<li>a million-line project should take 3400 person-months (290 lines of
  code per person-month),</li>
<li>a ten-million-line project should take 38k person-months (260 lines
  of code per person-month), and</li>
<li>a hundred-million-line project should take 430k person-months
  (230 lines of code per person-month).</li>
</ul>
<p>These two departures from theory are connected!  They have to do with
the density of connectivity in the codebase.  To escape the trap of
quadratic complexity, only a tiny fraction of the possible
interactions in the codebase can exist — a line of code invoked by
tens of thousands of callers probably cannot change its behavior, even
for the better, without introducing bugs.  By the same token, a
subroutine cannot depend on too much about the behavior of too many
other subroutines: it becomes too likely to break when one of the
others changes.</p>
<p>So, just in order to be able to keep writing those 10 lines of code
per day in that hundred-million-line project, you end up duplicating
facilities that exist elsewhere, perhaps in a restricted or more
efficient form.  You may not even know they exist; certainly you can’t
depend on them to retain their existing behavior and performance, or
not to have behavior or performance in corner cases that conflicts
with your needs.  Even if not, they may be in a language you can’t
invoke conveniently or contain subtle dependencies on control
structure, runtime facilities, or resource usage that you can’t afford
and perhaps don’t even know about.</p>
<p>And thus it is that the promise of exponential growth in software
capability with growing effort is lost.</p>
<p>But what if we were to bite the bullet?  What if we were willing to
accept that adding a line of code to a hundred-thousand-line system
was going to take 100 times as long as adding it to a
ten-thousand-line system?  If we could get back the exponential
growth, would it be worth it?</p>
<p>In terms of flexibility for experimentation, <em>no</em>.  If it takes you a
month to write a piece of code that ends up being five lines, <em>and
then you throw it away</em>, you surely would have been better served by
writing that throwaway code in some other way.  Even if it worked out
to be 200 lines of code instead of five, that would have been a much
better bargain.</p>
<p>But in terms of building the most powerful system, <em>yes</em>.  If a
thousand-line fully-coupled system takes you, say, 100 days and has
functionality of, say, One OTCC†, then we can predict the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a two-thousand-line system will take you 400 days and have a
  functionality of, say, two OTCCs;</li>
<li>a five-thousand-line system will take you 2500 days (7 years) and
  have 16 OTCCs of functionality (at which point you’re still behind
  where you would have been by just writing 25 single-OTCC systems);</li>
<li>a ten-thousand-line system will take you 27 years and have 512 OTCCs
  of functionality, at which point you are beating where you would
  have been with 100 single-OTCC systems by a factor of five;</li>
<li>a twenty-thousand-line system will take you 110 years and have 500k
  OTCCs of functionality, at which point you are beating where you
  would have been by writing 400 single-OTCC systems by a factor of
  11;</li>
<li>a fifty-thousand-line system will take you 680 years and have 560
  tera-OTCCs of functionality, at which point you are beating where
  you would have been by writing 2500 single-OTCC systems by a factor
  of 200 billion.  Yet you have been writing, on average, about a line
  of code per week.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>† OTCC is a small C compiler written by Fabrice Bellard for the
IOCCC, and it’s an exemplar of powerful functionality condensed into
a small package.  In the absence of any kind of reasonable unit for
software power, it's my best approximation of the maximum amount you
can get done in a thousand lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though I sort of pulled them out of my butt, these numbers are
sort of discouraging, even though they suggest that we can do
dramatically better at software development by improving reuse.  The
problem is that this level of reuse has such a high price tag that,
under these assumptions, you don’t start to break even for decades.
It’s hard to imagine that the correct numbers will make this look much
better.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
