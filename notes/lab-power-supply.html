(17 minutes)</div><p>I just made a 0–11.5V adjustable power supply from an ATX power supply
in the Ekospace hacklab.  Soldered the green wire (what is this called?) to
ground so the power supply turns on automatically and cannibalized a
SATA power connector to hook up the +12V yellow wire and ground to an
emitter follower built out of a TO-220 D13007K NPN power transistor
someone salvaged from a motherboard, three 2.2kΩ resistors (half-watt
I think), and a 10kΩ potentiometer.</p>
<p>This works for spinning up a tiny motor I found in the parts bin, but
it’s not very efficient, and it’s likely to burn up the transistor at
some point, because whatever voltage doesn’t appear on the output is
dissipated across the transistor.  The TO-220 could theoretically
dissipate 80W if it were like screwed to a heatsink or something, but
it’s not.  It could maybe dissipate like 20W, which at 12V would be
just 1.7 amps, although it can probably handle its rated 8 amps at its
max voltage, if not the full 18 available from the power supply in
question.</p>
<p>It has the additional disadvantages that there’s no display for the
voltage or current (you can set the voltage by hooking up a voltmeter
to the output while turning the knob) and the output voltage will
fluctuate with the input voltage from the ATX power supply, which can
vary.</p>
<p>So, what would a better solution look like?  You could build a buck
converter based on the AVR ATMega328 used in the Arduino.  It has an
internal 1.1V voltage reference.  You could use one of its six PWM
outputs (with 8 bits of precision you get 31.25kHz; I think you can
get 62.5kHz if you accept 7 bits of precision) to control the buck
converter.  A couple of external resistors could form a voltage
divider to scale down the buck converter’s output voltage to the 1.1V
range, which feeds into the ATMega328’s 10-bit ADC.  A transistor,
inductor, diode, and capacitor would complete the buck converter.  An
additional low-value sense resistor could measure current on a second
ADC channel (there’s one ADC but 6 or 8 pins that it can multiplex
between).  Then the AVR could produce output displaying the voltage
and current either on six seven-segment displays (13 digital GPIO pins
in the usual multiplexing arrangement) or through a speaker on a
second PWM channel.  A third ADC channel could be used to read a
potentiometer to control the output voltage.</p>
<p>How big do these external components need to be, and how much
precision do we need?</p>
<p>Supposing arbitrarily that I were to use a similar ATX power supply
capable of 18A on its 12V output, which works out to 216W (a bit over
a quarter horsepower), it would be nice to be able to carry that 216W
most of the way down the range, say down to 2V — which would mean 108
fucking amperes.  This is a somewhat unreasonable amount of amperage,
as common power transistors are typically in like the 1 to 8 amp
range.  A popular power transistor with somewhat more oomph is the
Siliconix SiS410DN, which costs 94¢ from Digi-Key and handles 35 amps;
then there’s the Nexperia PSMN4R0-40YS from 2010, which costs 88¢ and
handles 100 amps.  But I’m probably not going to salvage those from
discarded Argentine electronics.</p>
<p>I can buy similar power MOSFETs here in town at G.M. Electrónica or
SyC Electrónica, though, even if they are somewhat inferior and more
expensive.  They only carry International Rectifier parts (or
STMicroelectronics versions of them) in that range, though; they both
have, for example, the IRF540.  SyC’s price for the ST version is 60¢.</p>
<p>So let’s say I use one of those.  It turns on at 4V, so I don’t need a
gate drive level shifter.  The STMicroelectronics version SyC sells
for 60¢ handles 22 amps, which is more than the ATX power supply can
deliver anyway (though maybe a capacitor on the input of the buck
converter could help with that).  We only really need (or can display
on a 3-digit LED) about 100mV precision, so 128 duty cycles is
probably enough, so we can probably use the 62.5kHz speed.  How much
energy do we need to store in the inductor at 62.5kHz?</p>
<p>That’s 16 microseconds per cycle.  I’m a little unclear on exactly how
the math of buck converters works out but I am pretty sure that it
will not involve storing more than 16 microseconds’ worth of power in
the inductor, which would be three or four millijoules, and I’m pretty
sure it’s okay for the inductor current to fluctuate by 10% or so,
maybe a lot more.  So if ½LI² = 4 mJ and I = 18 A, then L = 2·4 mJ /
(18 A)² = 25μH, which I would have thought a fairly small inductor but
is apparently around the 75th percentile of modern inductors.
Combining that with the high current requirement leaves very few
options in Digi-Key’s catalog.</p>
<p>One such is the <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/wurth-electronics-inc/7443643300/732-5629-ND/4865754">Würth
7443643300</a>,
which goes for US$8.50 — 33μH, 30A, 2.4mΩ, self-resonant at 7MHz,
ferrite, 28.5mm × 19.5mm × 18.5 mm, ferrite, saturating at only 11.5A
(which seems like it could be a problem in this application!).  It
seems to be five turns of flat 3.8mm × 0.8mm copper tape!</p>
<p>So it’s feasible but maybe more study of buck converter math would
help me more.  PDM might also help by reducing the cycle time to
submicrosecond levels; ST’s IRF540 has a turn-on delay plus rise time
of 105ns, which means we can’t go deep submicrosecond without losing
efficiency, though Infineon’s part may be a bit faster.</p>
<p>Horowitz &amp; Hill draw the buck converter with a Schottky diode, which
makes a certain amount of sense — 18 amps at an 0.7-volt voltage drop
would be about 13W dissipated in the diode, and indeed most popular
large-current diodes on Digi-Key are Schottky, like the
VB30100S-E3/8W, which is 100V, 30A, in a TO-263AB surface-mount
package with a cathode-body connection; this has the ordinary 300mV
Schottky silicon voltage drop at ordinary currents, but at 10A it’s
already up over 500mV, and at 18A it’s almost 700mV.  At its rated
maximum 30A it’s 910mV.</p>
<p>Horowitz &amp; Hill also end up using a 150μH inductor for their first
example (5V, 500mA, 50kHz).  Is that less of a pain in the ass?</p>
<p>A 220μH 700mA ferrite inductor costs 32¢ at Digi-Key; a 150μH 1A
ferrite inductor is 56¢.  It has axial leads and is 6.4 mm in diameter
and 14 mm long.  A 150μH 2.2A ferrite inductor (saturating at 1.8A)
costs US$1.03 and is 12mm × 12mm, and at this point we’re starting to
get into lower frequencies, higher costs, and shielded construction.
At 4A and 150μH we’re getting into US$2.37 25mm iron toroids with
thick copper wire around them, and the price trend is clear, although
at this point still only linear with current — this one holds 1.2
millijoules, 500μJ/$, while the 2.2A one was only 350μJ/$.  Above 8A,
prices start to climb proportional to energy and we’re getting into
big wirewound powdered iron cores and then laminated silicon steel.</p>
<p><a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=354027.0">Someone tried making an Arduino-driven buck converter like what I’m
suggesting</a> and
discovered that since the IRF540 is an N-channel FET it’s a pain to
switch the high side with it.  Also apparently buck converters need to
react quickly to inductor saturation to prevent explosions.  <a href="http://docs.mipro-proceedings.com/sp/sp_09_4072.pdf">Some
Croats did it
successfully</a>.
They did use a humongous wire-wound toroid.</p>
<p>Man, I’ve really gotten hung up on the inductor, haven’t I?  It’s just
that I’m worried that a giant piece of shit like that could really
ruin what would otherwise be a tiny, cheap, ferocious power supply.</p>
<p>The freewheeling diode itself might function as an adequate current
sensing “resistor”; as mentioned above, a Schottky diode varies over
the 300–900mV range on its way up to 30 amps.  This is pretty
dependent on the temperature, but if you can somehow correct for that,
you should be able to measure the current within about 3% over a 10mA
to 10,000mA range, no problem.  I think the inductor-driven current
through the freewheeling diode may generate a negative voltage with
respect to ground, though, which is inconvenient for measurement.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could have like a 50mΩ sense resistor on the ground
side; at 18A this would be 900mV, and each millivolt change (about one
count on the ADC) would be 20 mA.  This introduces a little
instability into the voltage regulation, although for many loads you
could compensate for that adequately in software.</p>
<p>Scanning six 7-segment displays should be fairly trivial if you have
13 available GPIOs after the buck regulator PWM output and two ADCs.</p>
<p>To run the AVR itself off the 12V supply, if you’re not using an
entire Arduino, you could just use a 7805 regulator.  An ATMega328
supposedly uses 12mA at 8MHz active, so probably 30mA at 20MHz (though
another part of the datasheet says 12mA at 20MHz).  If it’s using ¼W
or ½W, it isn’t going to burn up the 7805 to be wasting another ⅜W or
⅝W.  Or maybe you could use a resistor and a 5V 1W zener (SyC has them
in stock for 11¢, although I have no idea how to salvage them).</p>
<p>Cheaper AVRs might work.  The ATTiny5 costs 35¢, runs at 12MHz, has a
four-channel 8-bit ADC, and has four I/O pins.  The cheapest AVR with
16 or more I/O pins is the 76¢ ATTiny40; it has 4KiB of flash, 256
bytes of RAM, runs up to 12MHz, and has 12 channels for its 10-bit
DAC.</p>
<p>I think probably the very next step is to hook up an AVR display to
the existing linear power supply to merely passively measure its
voltage.  This involves minimally an Arduino, three current-limiting
resistors (220Ω or 470Ω, say), three seven-segment displays, 10 GPIO
pins to run them, and a voltage divider to get the voltage input down
below 1.1V.</p>
<p>As a sub-step before that, I should see if I can run this calculator
LCD off my Arduino.  For that I won’t even need resistors.  But maybe
I can buy some transistors too.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, I salvaged (is that the word?) a four-digit seven-segment green
LED clock display from a Philips clock radio.  It’s an LTC-637D1G,
which turns out to be a Lite-On product from 2000; I already
reverse-engineered its pinout before googling up the datasheet, which
pretty much confirms what I’d already figured out — it’s a supremely
shitty pinout, with the dubious grace of having only two cathodes
instead of the expected four, so I can get by with two resistors
instead of four.  It had the benefit of lighting up visibly when
probed with the multimeter in the hacklab on the diode-test setting.
LED voltage measurements on the variable-voltage power supply show
that the LEDs start to become visible at about 4V on a 220Ω resistor,
at which point they themselves are dropping about 2 volts, leaving 2V
for the resistor, so the current is about 9mA.  Turning the power
supply up to 11.5V illuminates the LED more brightly but doesn’t burn
it out; at this point it has about 3V across it, which exceeds the
2.6V max from the datasheet, though I guess that was at 20mA, and this
is more like 38mA, which also exceeds the 25mA continuous current max
in the datasheet.</p>
<p>The datasheet says it can handle 100mA peak currents, but that’s not
safe if they’re running straight off an AVR pin.  The AVR as a whole
is only rated for 200mA on its Vcc and ground pins, and only up to
40mA per channel.  And if I use the 220Ω resistors I now have soldered
to the common cathodes, the max I’ll get at 3V (5V minus the LED’s 2V
or more drop) dropped across the resistor is 14mA.  On the plus side
that means I can run two diodes off one anode pin at the same time, so
I can scan across the active anode pins, toggling the cathode pins
between tri-stated and low according to whether that “pixel” is
supposed to be on or off.</p>
<p>Since this is a 24-hour clock display, the first digit is missing the
segment that isn’t displayed in either the digit 1 or 2.  So it’s
probably better to use just the last three digits.  These have only 11
anode lines between them; if all 11 have active data on them, I can
manage a 9.1% duty cycle.  This works out to an average bright current
of 1.3 mA, which I think will be barely visible at all.  This could be
improved slightly to like 1.8mA average, but getting it up to near the
10mA average suggested in the datasheet would require 11 high-side
drivers for the LED anodes, like bipolar transistors or something,
since that would require the full 100mA peak current specified — twice
that if both cathodes are active.  So for now I think I’ll give it a
pass.</p>
<p>So the AVR power supply voltmeter needs 11 anode pins, 2 cathode pins,
and one analog input pin, which means it can fit into much smaller
AVRs than the ATMega328.  The ATTiny40 with its 18 GPIO lines and 4K
of Flash, for example, should be fine.  It costs 76¢ and is 3.1mm ×
3.1mm in a VQFN.  (The 328’s smallest package is 5.1mm × 5.1mm.)</p>
<p>Refreshing at 1kHz (again, as suggested in the display datasheet)
would require iterating at 11kHz.  At the AVR’s internal RC oscillator
speed of 8MHz, this gives us 727 clock cycles per display update — far
more than necessary to respond to the timer interrupt.  At an
Arduino’s 16MHz speed, we have twice as many.</p>
<p>I cobbled together a voltage divider out of some carbon-composition
resistors found lying around; it turns out they are 140kΩ and 4.2kΩ,
so the voltage scaling factor will be 4.2/144.2 = .0291, so 12 volts
would be measured as 350 millivolts.  However, the AVR’s 1.1V internal
bandgap voltage reference is specified to be between 1.0 and 1.2 V, so
that might digitize as anywhere from 298 counts to 358, and the count
will change at least every 40 millivolts, which is about the right
accuracy for an 0.1-volt-resolution digital voltmeter.</p>
<hr />
<p>A thing I largely neglected above: a bench power supply needs current
limiting.  A purely linear approach to this is to use an LM317
(1.5A max) with ADJ connected to the load and a sense resistor between
it and OUT — the LM317 will let the full voltage through until 1.25V
is dropped over the sense resistor.  2Ω limits you to 625 mA, for
example.</p>
<p>You could reasonably run a sense resistor like this in series with the
usual voltage divider, limiting a weighted sum of current and voltage
rather than either one alone.  Or maybe you could use a couple of
diodes to limit them separately with a single LM317: either a large
enough output voltage or a large enough output current would pull down
the ADJ pin through diodes from the ADJ pin to the end of the sense
resistor and the middle of the voltage divider.  This also gives you
an extra 0.7V or so, so the ADJ pin won’t get to 1.25V below output
until the point that’s pulling it down is 1.95V below.</p>
<p>The LM317 has internal thermal overload protection, a plus, but it
needs 2.5 mA of output current to stay in regulation.  One big
disadvantage it has for this purpose is that it’s not LDO — it has a
2.5 V dropout, so it can’t deliver more than 9.5 V off a 12V ATX
supply.  If you keep the output resistor to ground under 500Ω then
it’ll always have enough bias current.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
