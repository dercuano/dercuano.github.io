(31 minutes)</div><p>Sandwich theory is the theory of sandwich structures, which are a kind
of anisotropic composite material consisting of two stiff “facesheets”
bonded to a lightweight “core”, like a two-dimensional version of a
one-dimensional I-beam; corrugated cardboard and drywall are the most
common examples.  I started reading about this because of an interest
in cardboard furniture (see <a href="../notes/cardboard-furniture.html">Cardboard furniture</a>) and recycled
materials.</p>
<h2>The basic theory</h2>
<h3>Basic strength-of-materials background</h3>
<p>When built with materials that aren’t full of cracks, structures
stressed in tension are generally quite strong, and in a way that
barely varies with size.  Piano wire (aka music wire — a kind of steel
used mostly for springs nowadays) has a yield stress of about 2.5 GPa,
so a platform that can support my 110 kg can be supported by 0.43 mm²
of piano wire, a wire 0.75 mm thick.  I’d have to sit down on it very
slowly to not break the wire on impact, and if you just connect the
wire directly to the platform, it will be kind of tippy; but hanging
by three or four such wires would be safe:</p>
<pre><code>    ||     ||
   w||     ||w
   i|| me  ||i
   r||  o  ||r
   e|| /|\ ||e
   s|| / \ ||s
    ---------
    platform
</code></pre>
<h4>Scaling</h4>
<p>Moreover, this holds whether the wires are connected to the ceiling
2.6 meters above my floor or to the top of a 100-meter-tall building
I’m swinging at the base of.  100 meters of four 0.43 mm² piano wires
would only weigh 1.4 kg, which is not a significant addition to my
weight; you have to get into kilometers of height before the weight of
the wire is a significant fraction of what it can support.</p>
<p>As Descartes observed, if we scale up the whole situation instead of
just the cable length, things get a little worse: a King-Kong-sized
person ten times my height, width, and breadth would weigh a thousand
times what I do, about 110 tonnes, while scaling up the cables from
0.75 mm to 7.5 mm in diameter only strengthens them to be able to
support 11 tonnes.  You’d need to increase them to 24 mm in diameter
to support the Kragen Kong.  Still, though, that’s not such an extreme
departure from uniform scaling.</p>
<h4>Compressive strength</h4>
<p>There’s a compressive strength that works the same way; if I put a
10-cm-diameter disk of cardboard under a wooden board and start piling
weight onto the board, there’s a certain amount of weight above which
the cardboard will get crushed; let’s say 300 kg, which is in the
ballpark but not a measured figure.  If you use several different
disks of the same cardboard, they’ll all crush at about the same
weight, and moreover that weight doesn’t change even if you stack two
or three or ten of the disks up; the same 300 kg will suffice to crush
the stack of ten disks as to crush a single disk.  If you use a bigger
disk, the weight needed to crush it will go up proportionally.</p>
<pre><code>     weight
       ##
      ####
     ######  
----------------- wood
  =============
  ============= disks
----------------------- floor
</code></pre>
<h4>Buckling</h4>
<p>But if you use smaller and smaller disks (and proportionally smaller
weights, including the wood), or taller and taller stacks, something
weird happens.  Well, not weird if you have any experience with
material objects, but different.  Once the stack gets taller than a
certain limit — say, around ten times its width, for
cardboard — taller and taller stacks can support less and less weight.
So I can stand on one 10-cm cardboard disk, and I can stand on a stack
of ten of them, and I can probably stand on the column of 650 of them
that it would take to reach 2.6 meters, but I definitely cannot stand
on a column of 100 meters of them.  In fact, I probably can’t even
build one.  Adding more cardboard to the stack in this way <em>reduces</em>
its compressive strength rather than leaving it unchanged.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about the top of the stack falling over sideways,
which also gets harder to avoid when the stack is taller; the
phenomenon I’m talking about happens even if you go into an elevator
shaft and rest an elevator-shaft-sized wooden platform on top of the
stack of smaller-than-shaft-size disks.
I’m talking about <em>buckling</em> (<em>pandeo</em> in Spanish),
where the <em>middle</em> of the stack bends outwards in some random
direction and it stops being a linear stack.  Buckling is governed not
by the compressive strength of the column but by the <em>rigidity</em> of the
column.</p>
<p>Euler worked out the basic math for this.  For compressive forces
below Euler’s critical value, any small bend in the column, for
example due to sound waves, gets straightened back out by the column’s
elasticity.  But once the column is bearing a load over Euler’s
critical limit, such a small bend will get amplified by the
compressive stress more and more.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling">Euler’s critical load</a> is
π²<em>EI</em>/(<em>KL</em>)², where <em>E</em> is the modulus of elasticity of the beam,
<em>I</em> is the least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_second_moments_of_inertia">planar area moment of inertia</a> of the column’s cross
section (πr⁴/2 for a solid circle), <em>L</em> is the length of the column,
and K (the “column effective length factor”) varies between ½ and 2;
it’s ½ in this case because the cardboard disks resting flat on the
ground and the elevator-shaft platform are not free to rotate.</p>
<p>Sadly I don’t have the faintest idea what the modulus of elasticity of
corrugated cardboard in lateral compression is, but the things to
notice about this expression are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s inverse-quadratic in <em>L</em>, so a column ten times as long can
   bear only one-hundredth the weight without buckling.</li>
<li>It’s directly proportional to the modulus of elasticity, so a beam
   that’s made from a material that’s one-third as stiff can only bear
   one-third the weight without buckling.</li>
<li>It doesn’t involve the <em>strength</em> of the cardboard <em>at all</em>; it
   only depends on its <em>stiffness</em>.</li>
<li>Compressive and tensile strengths are proportional to the
   cross-sectional area, but Euler’s critical buckling load is
   proportional to the area moment of inertia, <em>not</em> the
   cross-sectional area.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The consequences for designing large structures</h4>
<p>Point #1 here means that, normally, large structures fail because of
buckling before than they fail because of tensile or compressive
failure, unless they’re made of materials that are full of cracks.
This means that if you can improve buckling behavior somehow, you can
dramatically extend the size of structures you can construct.</p>
<p>These last three points are crucial to sandwich theory!  By stiffening
columns with high-stiffness facesheets, and increasing the moment of
inertia by moving those facesheets further apart by inflating the core
(even at the cost of some strength), we can make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_structured_composite">sandwich-structured
composites</a> that resist buckling enormously more effectively than
their component materials.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s also flexural stress.  Sometimes large structures fail
because of flexural failure — trees dropping branches or blowing over
in a storm are examples.  Moreover, flexural stress shares with
buckling the property that you really need a great deal more material
to resist the load than you would expect — a steel beam that can
support my weight in flexion is generally going to need a great deal
more than 0.43 mm² of cross section.  I am going to mostly ignore
flexural stress, except as it contributes to buckling, because ⓐ the
same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_panel">sandwich-panel</a> construction that helps with buckling also helps
with flexural stress, and ⓑ flexural loads for a given beam
construction only fall inverse-proportional to the characteristic
dimension of the structure, while buckling loads are
inverse-proportional to its square, so for large enough structures
buckling still dominates.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Cracks</h4>
<p>The cheapest building materials — earth, brick, other fired-clay
ceramics, concrete, mortar, glass, plaster of Paris, and often even
stone — are all full of cracks.  As long as they’re in compression,
this doesn’t matter, but once they’re in tension, the cracks form
stress risers that weaken them enormously.  This makes it difficult
and dangerous to build large structures from them unless they’re
heavily reinforced with materials with good tensile strength.  Adobe
is made from earth reinforced with straw, plaster of Paris is commonly
reinforced with horsehair, and concrete is commonly reinforced with
steel rebar.  Even so, larger buildings are invariably steel-framed
rather than relying on the tensile strength of even reinforced
masonry.</p>
<h3>Basic sandwich-theory background</h3>
<p>The moment of inertia around the x-axis, <em>Iₓ</em>, is ∫∫<em>y</em>²d<em>x</em>d<em>y</em>
where the area integrated over is that of the cross-section.  For
panels, that’s the only one we care about, because the panel is much
wider than it is thick, so if we take our x-axis parallel to its
surface, the y-axis moment of inertia is orders of magnitude too big
to worry about.</p>
<p>This says that if we have some cross-sectional area of material, we
can increase its moment of inertia proportionally, to an arbitrarily
high level, by moving it further from the x-axis:</p>
<pre><code>small moment  large moment

--*****--     --*****--

                *****
</code></pre>
<p>The trouble with this is that once we insert empty spaces in the
middle, it stops being a solid object.  We need to put enough stuff in
the middle to keep the parts moving together; the stuff in the middle
is pretty much only stressed in <em>shear</em>.  Also, when the column is
flexing, the facesheet on the inside of the bend is in compression
merely from the flexing, and that compression can cause <em>it</em> to
buckle.</p>
<p>If we only have one material to work with, we can improve the
situation by moving almost all the material as far as possible from
the x-axis in both directions, leaving the rest of the material as
fine “webs” in between to resist the shear, and we have an I-beam, or
rectangular tubing, or a channel, or a sort of sandwich panel:</p>

<p>(This kind of sandwich panel, a single plastic with square channels
running through it, is in common use for translucent roofing for bus
stops around here; it’s called “twinwall plastic” when made from
polycarbonate, and similar sandwich panels made from other plastics
are called “corrugated plastic”, “corriboard”, or “coroplast”.)</p>
<p>More generally, you can use a different kind of material in the
middle, maybe one with not much strength of any kind, just enough to
resist the shear stress.  Incidentally, that shear stress is <em>also</em>
inversely proportional to the distance between the facesheets, so if
your panel is thick, you can get by with a very wimpy core material.
You do still need enough tensile and compressive strength provided by
the cross-sectional area of the facesheets <em>and</em> the core to withstand
the tensile and compressive stresses on the panel from its edges, but
in a large structure, that is a much easier problem than preventing
buckling.</p>
<p>XXX understand the theory</p>
<p>An underappreciated aspect of sandwich panels is that they are not
only stronger (in flexure and buckling) but also softer than the same
materials would be if solid.  This can increase their impact strength.</p>
<h3>Common current sandwich-panel examples</h3>
<p>Single-wall corrugated cardboard, as I said, is the most common kind
of sandwich panel in daily life.  It has a smooth “linerboard” paper
on the “outside”, according to <a href="https://youtu.be/o9fSsewMLo">Angela Ben-Eliezer</a>, a corrugated
paper layer of “flutes”, and a second linerboard paper on the “inside”
which is not smooth, all glued together, typically with sodium
silicate.  The linerboard layers play the role of facesheets, while
the flutes play the role of the core — a highly anisotropic core, in
this case.</p>
<p>The inner fluted layer is mostly air — typical corrugated cardboard is
made from paper of about 90–130 g/m², which makes it about 150 μm
thick, but has a 4-mm-thick fluted layer, so the fluted layer is about
96% air and 4% paper, and the cardboard as a whole is about 88% air
and 12% paper.  In fact, only part of the flutes — about half — is in
the fluted layer itself.  The other half is glued flat to one or the
other linerboard, making it part of the facesheet.</p>
<p>Double-wall and triple-wall corrugated cardboard is a less common
material, used for higher-strength applications.  Triple-wall
cardboard has three layers of flutes and four layers of linerboard,
and the interesting thing here is that the inner layer of flutes is
typically substantially thicker than the outer layers.  That is, it’s
a sandwich panel whose facesheets are themselves sandwich
panels!  It’s a recursive sandwich!</p>
<p>Drywall is a sandwich of gypsum (plaster of Paris) between two sheets
of paper.  Unlike the other examples, this isn’t to help it bear
buckling loads; it’s to give it tensile strength (and thus flexural
strength) so you can carry it around and drive screws through it,
instead of shattering the way plaster on lath would do if you treated
it that way.</p>
<p>Corrugated sheet steel is similar to corrugated cardboard, but just
the flutes, without the linerboard; it’s just a wavy sheet of steel.
This is not the most efficient use of material, since the “core”
consists of roughly as much steel as the “facesheets”, but it’s very
cheap to make.  Slightly more elaborate corrugated sheet metal, like
that used for the walls of shipping containers or aluminum siding,
uses sharp bends to increase the amount of material in the
“facesheets” while still being inexpensive to fabricate by bending a
single sheet.</p>
<p>Foamcore is a sandwich made of two sheets of paper with styrofoam in
between, commonly used for architectural models and picture framing.</p>
<p>The Hexayurt is made from sandwich panels sold in the US and some
other countries for house insulation; these are foamed
polyisocyanurate with aluminum-flashing facesheets.  Similar
lightweight rigid sandwich panels made of various materials are common
insulating materials; when the facesheets are some kind of structural
board material like OSB or drywall, it’s called a “structural
insulated panel”.</p>
<h3>Current more exotic examples</h3>
<p>Fiberglass fabric glued onto the surface of styrofoam is a common
material for small airplanes, especially model airplanes.</p>
<p>RV enthusiasts have taken to fabricating furniture by cutting
styrofoam to shape, fitting them together, and coating the surface
with some kind of stiffener, such as fiberglass window screening
material stuck to the foam with latex paint.</p>
<p>I’m seeing sandwich panels on some of the bus lines here in Buenos
Aires; they seem to have polyethylene cores and melamine facesheets.</p>
<p>Cement board has been a common building material for decades; it’s a
sandwich with a cellulose-reinforced portland cement core and
glass-fiber mesh facesheets.  It’s kind of like drywall, but a lot
stiffer; it’s useful as an underlayment to keep tile floors laid over
wood from breaking when the wood flexes.</p>
<p>Common FDM 3-D printing slicers will, by default, fill the interior of
the model (whatever its shape) with a honeycomb, thus making it a sort
of three-dimensional quasi-sandwich-panel.  This is mostly to cut down
printing time, but it also helps to compensate for PLA’s abysmal
impact strength.</p>
<p>In aerospace, sandwiches with sheet-metal facesheets and metal
honeycomb cores are common.</p>
<p>The Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, which killed 72 people, about a
quarter of those present, was caused in large part by the use of
Arconic Reynobond PE sandwich panels, with aluminum facesheets around
a polyethylene core (not, I think, foam), which were covering an
150-mm-thick layer of polyisocyanurate foam under a ventilation space.</p>
<h2>Candidates for upcycling garbage into sandwich panels</h2>
<h3>Very common materials: styrofoam, cardboard, boPET, TetraPak, beer cans, plywood, sheet metal</h3>
<p>Styrofoam and cardboard are the two most obvious candidate core
materials, but many others are possible.  boPET, as in discarded chip
bags and one of the layers in TetraPak drink boxes, is fairly stiff,
and so boPET and TetraPak are abundant candidates for facesheet
materials; cardboard is also a good candidate.</p>
<p>Thin aluminum sheet, as from drink cans, is considerably stronger and
stiffer in tension than either of those; it might make a good
facesheet.  More broadly, sheet metal is often discarded, and it makes
a fantastic facesheet material, as do plywood and OSB.</p>
<p>Drink cans have a particularly interesting property: they are mostly
coated on the inside with a thin layer of very chemically inert
plastic, usually a food-safe epoxy.  It might be possible to use this
coating as a ready-made glue (see below about the difficulties of
glues) to stick the rolled-flat shreds of shredded cans together, like
wood chipboard.  Some combination of heat, pressure, and previous
functionalization with cold plasma (see <a href="../notes/cold-plasma-oxidation.html">Cold plasma oxidation</a>)
might do the trick.  This should not require temperatures anywhere
close to those necessary to melt the aluminum.</p>
<p><em>Expanded</em> sheet metal — that stuff they use for security grilles and
transparent nonskid steel stairs — is likely an <em>excellent</em> facesheet
material, but it is only very stiff along one of its axes.</p>
<p>Fabric-backed vinyl is discarded in bulk when billboards are updated
with new advertising, and it has its merits, but it is sufficiently
useful that it already tends to get recycled.</p>
<h3>Cloth and circuit-board facesheets</h3>
<p>Woven cloth (from discarded clothes, mattresses, etc.) is another
candidate facesheet ingredient — unbroken chains of fibers running in
long straight lines along the surface will contribute more stiffness
than the same fibers in a more disordered mass like that of paper.
Knit cloth would contribute little stiffness by itself, but “nonwoven
cloth” ought to be intermediate, like paper.  Glass-fiber cloth or
cloth woven from Kevlar, Nomex, or Spectra would be ideal, but are
hard to find, except in the form of glass-fiber window screens.  Some
cloths are probably not suitable: nylon and silk are elastic enough
that they probably wouldn’t add enough stiffness.</p>
<p>(Aluminum or steel window screens would work too.)</p>
<p>Of course, these materials by themselves need some kind of glue to
turn them into facesheets.  (See below about glues.)</p>
<p>Discarded circuit boards are extremely stiff: they are made of
glass-fiber cloth impregnated with a plastic such as phenolic resin.
They are relatively abundant in the waste stream, and would be ideal.</p>
<h3>Other core materials derivable from garbage</h3>
<p>Since the core is ideally very thick, it can be made from a quite weak
material, including plastic foams, especially microcellular foams.  So
foaming discarded thermoplastics, for example with nitrogen, is a
potentially very interesting way to upcycle them.</p>
<p>Most organic matter can be reduced to some kind of charcoal by heating
at high enough temperature without oxygen.  Charcoal is very
rigid — more so the purer it is — and lightweight, because it’s
basically a foam.  It might make a very reasonable core material.
It’s usually full of cracks, so unless you crush it into a powder, its
tensile strength is very low.  One possible approach to that problem
is to form the organic matter into a fine <em>open-cell</em> foam <em>before</em>
carbonizing it, for example by baking it into bread, and then heating
and cooling it very slowly.  That might yield a carbon foam with
reasonable tensile strength but I wouldn’t bet on it.</p>
<p>Carbon black — charcoal formed as smoke rather than in solid form — is
routinely used to add tensile strength to rubber, for example in car
tires and shoe soles.  It, too, can be produced from almost any
organic matter.</p>
<h3>Pretensioning facesheets</h3>
<p>Facesheets are only strong when in tension; when in compression they
rely on the core material to support them against buckling.  If
there’s a way to pretension them somehow, this could increase the
strength of the whole structure.  One way would be to simply pull on
the facesheets during the lamination process, so they are stretched
while the bond is being formed.  Alternatively, some plastics might
enter into tension when heated, the way PET drink bottles and
shrinkwrap do.  Another alternative: in cloth aircraft construction,
after construction, the cloth surface is impregnated with a substance
called “dope”, which shrinks as it cures, setting up tension in the
cloth.  Is there a “dope” that could be used to pretension sandwich
panel facesheets in this way?</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the core material is a closed-cell foam, you might
be able to pretension the facesheets this the other way around, by
setting up compression in the foam.  A couple of ways to do this: you
could assemble the sandwich panel in a chamber under high pressure,
thus partly collapsing the cells of the foam; or you could arrange for
air to diffuse through the foam into the cells after assembly, for
example by baking the foam in a vacuum <em>before</em> assembly, long enough
for a substantial fraction of the air to diffuse out.</p>
<p>Typically the blowing agents diffuse out of the foam after it is
produced, and this is often considered problematic when it happens
faster than air diffuses in — it means that the foam contracts shortly
after fabrication, then later expands again after absorbing air — but
it produces a critical period during which sandwich-panel fabrication
would pretension the facesheets.  So, perhaps the same phenomenon
could be provoked intentionally, either by foaming the plastic with
the usual blowing agents or by provoking a very volatile gas like
hydrogen, helium, or methane to diffuse into the foam first.  (A
chamber full of methane is a lot easier to produce than a vacuum
chamber, if perhaps more dangerous.)</p>
<h3>Stiff facesheet materials (some weak)</h3>
<p>Because the primary purpose of the facesheet is increasing <em>rigidity</em>,
not strength, in order to resist buckling, it might make sense to use
materials with high rigidity and low strength; glass, plaster, and
cement come to mind.</p>
<p>Generally, filled plastic systems can get a lot of rigidity from the
filler, so using a high-rigidity filler like rocks, sand, clay,
cullet, grog, eggshells, carbon, or machining swarf might make sense.
(The usefulness of such fillers isn’t strictly limited to “plastics”
as such; they are of course a key part of concrete, mortar, and
fired-clay ceramics, in which cases they mostly contribute strength
rather than rigidity.)  Such fillers work better with large aspect
ratios, so that the individual filler particles can more easily be
much closer together than their large dimension, so that when the
material as a whole is stressed in tension or compression, the binder
between them is stressed in shear over a much larger cross-sectional
area than that of each interacting filler particle.  This way, most of
the tensile deformation of the bulk material comes from stretching
filler particles rather than stretching or shear-deforming the
less-rigid binder.</p>
<p>A hexagonal, herringbone-brick, or jigsaw-puzzle pattern of facesheet
tiles, with a little space between them, could provide rigidity
without causing the facesheet to break when its elastic limit is
exceeded.</p>
<p>These approaches aren’t viable if ⓐ the core material is so weak that
you’re depending on the facesheet to provide tensile <em>strength</em> as
well; or ⓑ the sandwich panel is sufficiently stressed in flexion, as
opposed to buckling, to depend on the facesheet’s strength as well as
its rigidity.</p>
<h3>Other facesheets</h3>
<p>Masonite, medium-density fiberboard, wood, paper, PMMA, CDs, wet
wipes, fabric-softener sheets, and many other things are also
plausible facesheet materials.</p>
<p>Particle board is made from sawdust pressed into panels under pressure
with a glue, typically melamine resin or phenolic resin.  This
approach, possibly with different glues (see below about glues), might
be feasible for fabricating facesheet panels from a variety of
waste-stream fiber sources: sawdust, wood shavings, coffee grounds,
yerba mate, grass clippings, hair clippings, machining swarf, dry
leaves, chipped prunings, shredded paper, shredded cardboard,
dehydrated sliced vegetables, fiberglass from demolition (at the risk
of asbestos), shredded cloth, bagasse, straw, pencil shavings, peanut
shells, sunflower-seed shells, wicker, or chicken feathers, for
example.  As mentioned above, adding some high-rigidity fillers like
sand, clay, cullet, grog, or eggshells may improve the rigidity of the
resulting material, just as it would a filled plastic system.</p>
<p>(Needless to say, such composite materials could be used for things
other than sandwich panels, too, or even panels.)</p>
<h3>Glues</h3>
<p>How can you do the lamination, so the facesheets can’t slide along the
surface of the core?</p>
<p>You might be able to use just standard modern adhesives: epoxy,
melamine, and phenolic resins.  But these are entirely impractical to
obtain from the waste stream, and there are cheaper alternatives.</p>
<p>Some materials can be bonded just with heat, and in some other cases
you can use small amounts of thermoplastics to bond together layers of
non-thermoplastic materials, like the EVA in a hot-glue gun.  And, as
mentioned above, latex paint works well enough under some
circumstances, but it’s difficult and somewhat dangerous to find
discarded.  Porous facesheet materials like cloth and window screen
allow air access to the binder, which is essential for the curing of
many binders.</p>
<p>In some cases the strength requirement for the adhesive may be low
enough that even paraffin wax (or polyethylene or PET) could be used
as a hot-melt adhesive, perhaps with a filler such as clay to stiffen
it and add strength.  Wet clay also makes an excellent weak adhesive
which hardens and contracts on drying.</p>
<p>The five traditional adhesives are slaked lime, wheat paste, mucilage,
hide glue, and birch tar, the first four of which can be made from
garbage at varying levels of personal risk, or from very inexpensive
non-garbage materials.  They might work.  Wheat paste and mucilage
don’t stick very well to nonpolar materials like common plastics, and
slaked lime is caustic.  Birch tar is probably not practical in the
modern context.  Most of these need some degree of care to keep them
from rotting, blue vitriol being a traditional pH-neutral antifungal.</p>
<p>Blood is also sticky and dries hard, due to its albumin content, and
there’s a lot of animal blood in the waste stream, but for whatever
reason it isn’t widely used as an adhesive, perhaps due to excessive
clotting.</p>
<p>“Pressure-sensitive” or “constant-tack” adhesives like those used in
duct tape, packing tape, and postit notes are not really suitable for
structural use, because, being viscous liquids, they will flow
continuously if under strain.  They can resist compression, but in
shear or, especially, tension, they will gradually release their bond.
In structural applications this is potentially disastrous: weeks,
months, or years after initial construction of a structure, its
sandwich panels could delaminate and fail, apparently spontaneously.</p>
<p>Asphalt or pitch, as used in roofing membranes, is on the edge here.
It’s a viscous liquid, but at room temperature its flow rates are low
enough that it might be acceptable, if the panels won’t be exposed to
heat.</p>
<p>Thin-enough porous facesheets could be simply painted with boiled
linseed oil, but oxygen needs to be able to diffuse to the
facesheet-core interface to be able to polymerize the oil there.  More
generally, it might be possible to polymerize such “drying oils” with
oxidizing agents like sodium percarbonate or ozone.  (Linoleum
flooring is polymerized linseed oil with a filler painted onto a
coarse cloth backing.)</p>
<p>Some kinds of core or facesheet materials could be welded with a small
amount of solvent, such as acetone, MEK, or ethyl acetate.  Doing this
on styrofoam is tricky because the solvent tends to eat the cells it
touches; perhaps a little vapor, rather than drops of liquid, would do
the trick.</p>
<p>Such solvents can also be used to make glues from other waste
plastics, such as PVC pipe or polystyrene foam, peanuts, or food
containers.</p>
<p>A final, more exotic, glue is sodium silicate, which can be made in
bulk very inexpensively, simply by boiling quartz in lye; this has the
benefit of hardening on timescales measured in seconds when gassed
with CO₂.  As I mentioned above, this is commonly used to make
corrugated cardboard; it also waterproofs concrete.  (Potassium
silicate is nearly equivalent.)</p>
<h3>Glueless lamination</h3>
<p>Since the objective of gluing the lamination interface is resisting
shear, not tension, the facesheets could also be connected to the core
by non-adhesive means, such as nails, tacks, staples, or sewing — a
thread or wire passed repeatedly through holes in the sandwich panel
to keep the facesheets from sliding relative to the core.  These
approaches are more practical with fairly rigid facesheets, since in
between the mechanical attachment points, the facesheet on a side in
compression must resist buckling on its own without any real support
from the core.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
