(4 minutes)</div><p>I was reading about the Z-machine and playing around with “Lists and
Lists”, which is a Lisp tutorial interactive-fiction game running on
the Z-machine, playable online in Parchment at
<a href="http://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/lists/">http://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/lists/</a>.</p>
<p>I was struck by the fact that the basic Z-machine memory model has a
combination of two properties very rarely found together: it has no
dynamic allocation (and thus no possibility of out-of-memory errors
and no need for a garbage collector), but it supports flexible
collections and relationships of objects, like Lisp.  Also, the basic
operations on its memory model are constant-time.</p>
<p>The basic memory model of the Z-machine is a fixed set of objects
(“Things”, originally) which are referenceable by integer IDs,
arranged into an ordered tree.  (Or, really, a forest, since there can
be any number of separate roots.)</p>
<p>Mutating the tree structure is normally done with this single
Z-machine opcode (from
<a href="http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/sect15.html">http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/sect15.html</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>insert_obj: Moves object O to become the first child of the
destination object D. (Thus, after the operation the child of D is
O, and the sibling of O is whatever was previously the child of D.)
All children of O move with it. (Initially O can be at any point in
the object tree; it may legally have parent zero.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Navigating the tree structure is done with three opcodes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>get_child: Get first object contained in given object, branching if
this exists, i.e. is not nothing (i.e., is not 0).</p>
<p>get_parent: Get parent object (note that this has no “branch if
exists” clause).</p>
<p>get_sibling: Get next object in tree, branching if this exists,
i.e. is not 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(In addition to the tree structure, the objects have arbitrary mutable
fields (“properties”) drawn from a small set of 64 field IDs, with
values containing a variable amount of data up to 64 bytes, but
usually 1 or 2 bytes; they also have 48 boolean “attributes”.  And
they have a “short name” too.  Each of the 64 possible properties has
defined a “default value” in a “property defaults table” which is
returned when you try to read that property from an object that
doesn’t have it.  These aspects of the object memory are somewhat
incidental, but without some way of associating other data with the
objects, the whole tree thing would be almost pointless.  Also, you
can access memory as an array of bytes.)</p>
<p>In order to make get_parent and insert_obj constant-time and fast,
each object has a redundant parent pointer.</p>
<p>The typical kinds of interactions in text adventure games involve
doing things like listing the objects in a room, or searching through
the objects in a room to see which one the player is referring to, and
whether that might be ambiguous; they aren't sensitive to the ordering
of the objects in the room.</p>
<p>So I was wondering what kind of Lispy generic functions you could
write on top of this ruthlessly-side-effect-filled structure.  Clearly
you can write a constant-space function that visits every object in a
subtree, for example, or moves all the objects in a subtree, or all
the children, to a given other object.  But can you write
general-purpose utilities to raise the level of abstraction at which
you program?  It seems like CLU-style coroutine iterators might be the
best you can do in many cases.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
