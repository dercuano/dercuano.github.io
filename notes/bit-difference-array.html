(10 minutes)</div><p>So I was thinking about the sparse difference-array representation
METAFONT uses for rows of pixels: +1 at the left edge of an ink area,
-1 at the right edge.  Once all the ink is thus applied, potentially
including overlapping strokes, the prefix sum is calculated, thus
spreading the ink, and the pixels with positive, or nonzero, amounts
of ink are then colored.  If you instead color pixels with odd amounts
of ink, you get even-odd filling rather than nonzero filling.</p>
<p>In METAFONT, IIRC, the difference array is sparse: it contains
(X-coordinate, increment) pairs, which could be specialized to (X, ±1)
if we allow duplicate Xes.  This allows an arbitrarily high
X-resolution, for a fixed number of edges anyway, at only logarithmic
cost.  For a number of edges E much larger than the number of pixel
positions N, a dense array is more efficient, since it can coalesce
multiple edges that happen to cross the scan line within the same
pixel; it need only contain N items instead of the larger number E.</p>
<p>Dense arrays also have the advantage of permitting more regular
processing which fits better into CPUs.  In what follows, I’m only
considering dense arrays.</p>
<h2>Gray code on bit-packed scanlines</h2>
<p>It occurred to me that, in the even-odd case, you could use single
bits for the pixels, and the prefix-sum operation and its inverse are
simply the operations of converting between binary and
reflected-binary Gray code.  Converting from binary to RBGC, the
backward difference operation, is simple and efficient (<code>x ^ x &gt;&gt; 1</code>),
but the inverse operation (RBGC to binary, prefix-sum of XOR) is
somewhat less efficient on a normal CPU.  Chapter 13 of <em>Hacker’s
Delight</em> is about Gray code, and it gives this algorithm for 32 bits:</p>
<pre><code>B = G ^ G &gt;&gt; 1;
B ^= B &gt;&gt; 2;
B ^= B &gt;&gt; 4;
B ^= B &gt;&gt; 8;
B ^= B &gt;&gt; 16;
</code></pre>
<p>An additional shifted-XOR is needed for 64 bits.  GCC for amd64
renders this as follows, requiring three instructions per line, 18
instructions in all, plus in this case a <code>retq</code> of overhead:</p>
<pre><code>  400620:   48 89 f8                mov    %rdi,%rax
  400623:   48 d1 f8                sar    %rax
  400626:   48 31 f8                xor    %rdi,%rax
  400629:   48 89 c2                mov    %rax,%rdx
  40062c:   48 c1 fa 02             sar    $0x2,%rdx
  400630:   48 31 d0                xor    %rdx,%rax
  400633:   48 89 c2                mov    %rax,%rdx
  400636:   48 c1 fa 04             sar    $0x4,%rdx
  40063a:   48 31 d0                xor    %rdx,%rax
  40063d:   48 89 c2                mov    %rax,%rdx
  400640:   48 c1 fa 08             sar    $0x8,%rdx
  400644:   48 31 d0                xor    %rdx,%rax
  400647:   48 89 c2                mov    %rax,%rdx
  40064a:   48 c1 fa 10             sar    $0x10,%rdx
  40064e:   48 31 d0                xor    %rdx,%rax
  400651:   48 89 c2                mov    %rax,%rdx
  400654:   48 c1 fa 20             sar    $0x20,%rdx
  400658:   48 31 d0                xor    %rdx,%rax
  40065b:   c3                      retq
</code></pre>
<p>This works out to 0.28 instructions per pixel, which is still less
than 1, and furthermore a third of those are <code>mov</code>s that might
disappear in the micro-op representation inside the CPU, but it’s not
the order-of-magnitude kind of speedup we might hope for.</p>
<p>(On ARM Thumb-2 (not shown) it’s 28 instructions.)</p>
<p>If you’re running this operation on an entire scanline to compute its
XOR prefix sum, you need to bring in the output parity bit from the
previous word as well.</p>
<h2>Bitsliced scanlines</h2>
<p>Another approach to this problem is to bitslice it.  Suppose that we
have an array of 1024 32-bit words W, each word W[i] of which has bit
N set (i.e. <code>0 != (W[i] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; N))</code>) iff there is a left-right
boundary at (i, N).  Then we can calculate the XOR prefix sum,
i.e. convert each row of pixels from RBGC to binary, simply and
efficiently in parallel across the scan lines:</p>
<pre><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt; 1024; i++) W[i] ^= W[i-1];
</code></pre>
<p>This gets compiled to the following for amd64:</p>
<pre><code>   0:   48 8d 47 04             lea    0x4(%rdi),%rax
   4:   48 8d 8f 00 10 00 00    lea    0x1000(%rdi),%rcx
   b:   8b 50 fc                mov    -0x4(%rax),%edx
   e:   31 10                   xor    %edx,(%rax)
  10:   48 83 c0 04             add    $0x4,%rax
  14:   48 39 c8                cmp    %rcx,%rax
  17:   75 f2                   jne    b &lt;xor_prefix_sum_bitslice+0xb&gt;
  19:   f3 c3                   repz retq
</code></pre>
<p>This inner loop is 5 instructions (two of which contain memory
references) processing 32 pixels.  It takes about 2.2 μs on my 1.6 GHz
Pentium N3700, or 67 ps per pixel, 9.3 pixels per clock cycle.  But
you can unroll it, say by a factor of 4:</p>
<pre><code>  W[1] ^= W[0];
  W[2] ^= W[1];
  W[3] ^= W[2];
  for (int i = 4; i &lt; 1024; i += 4) {
    W[i] ^= W[i-1];
    W[i+1] ^= W[i];
    W[i+2] ^= W[i+1];
    W[i+3] ^= W[i+2];
  }

<p>This processes 128 pixels in 11 instructions, although 8 of those
instructions contain memory references, so it’s really more like 19
instructions.  (Or more, if you count the indexing operation
separately.)  It takes about 1.0 μs on my 1.6 GHz Pentium N3700, or
31 ps per pixel, 20 pixels per clock cycle.  Filling a megapixel thus
would require 31 μs, assuming you don’t incur cache misses.</p>
<p>These numbers give us respectively 0.156 (5/32), 0.086 (11/128), and
0.148 (19/128) instructions per pixel.  That’s more like it!</p>
<p>(That also suggests that the N3700 is managing about 1.7 instructions
per clock cycle.)</p>
<p>You might hope that other architectures would be more efficient, but
they seem to be about the same; here’s an ARM Thumb-2 compilation of
the same unrolled loop, which is one byte shorter and has 16
instructions instead of 11 in the inner loop; it avoids the redundant
memory loads of the amd64 version, but has to use explicit loads and
stores.</p>

<p>On a 64-bit machine, we could halve all these numbers, at the expense
of doubling the working set (to 8 KiB) and the data traffic to the
cache, by using 64-bit words.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, then we need to transpose the bit matrix to get the
pixels in the usual scanline order.</p>
<h2>Oversampling</h2>
<p>These approaches might be sufficiently efficient to permit you to do
antialiasing by the brute-force approach of oversampling.  For
example, if you do brute-force oversampling in both X and Y, you have
four subpixels per screen pixel, and thus five gray levels for each
screen pixel (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).</p>
<h2>Even-odd-filled polylines</h2>
<p>If you have a closed polygon or polyline, in theory you can just draw
the edges into your scanline buffer with XOR (<code>W[x] ^= 1 &lt;&lt; y</code> or
<code>W[y*w + x/N] ^= 1 &lt;&lt; (x%N)</code> or whatever) and get it filled this way.
But you have to be careful about vertices: in the scanline where a
vertex falls, you must be careful to XOR it into that scanline only
once, not once for the line that starts there and again for the line
that ends there.  That bug leads to an inverse-video bleed-across on
that line.</p>
<p>Similarly, you need to be careful with local minima and maxima of the
Y-coordinate along the border, particularly if there’s a vertex
present.</p>
<h2>Gradient and texture fills</h2>
<p>The above algorithms handle solid-color fills pretty well, but solid
colors nearly don’t exist in nature.  Even objects whose color is
perfectly homogeneous are usually lit by inhomogeneous lighting,
either because they are curved, because of fuzzy shadows, or because
of varying distances to nearby light sources, including indirect light
diffused from other objects.  So non-computer-screen objects almost
always have gradients.</p>
<p>Also, non-computer-screen objects usually have texture.  Wood has
grain, cement or dirt has white-noise texture, hair has striation,
cloth has weave, and so on.  At large grain, we can handle this by
drawing thousands of objects, but the grains of a brick or the hair of
a crowd of people, for example, is impractical to handle this way.</p>
