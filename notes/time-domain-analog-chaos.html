(4 minutes)</div><p>There are a variety of circuits published with chaotic analog
behavior, iterating chaotic maps like the logistic map (in its domain
of chaos) or the tent map, typically producing either a voltage-mode
signal or a current-mode signal.  These are sometimes used as analog
noise sources similar to an amplified Johnson-noise source or an LFSR,
but they operate in discrete time; each iteration of the map takes
place after a clock pulse.</p>
<p>I was thinking about jittering the sampling time of an
analog-to-digital conversion to eliminate aliasing, and it occurred to
me that what I wanted was a chaotic analog circuit that produced a
signal that was not a voltage or a current, but a time interval.
Moreover, a straightforward mechanism using two coupled relaxation
oscillators occurred to me.</p>
<p>The <em>dyadic map</em> is a particularly simple chaotic map when considered
as a formula: just f(x) = 2x mod 1.  So, for example, it maps 0.1,
0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.0, 0.2.  This is
equivalent to shifting a binary fraction to the left by one bit and
discarding the overflow, so terminating binary fractions eventually
find their way to the map’s single fixed point, 0.0, and repeating
binary fractions are periodic with a period of their repeating length.
So you have, for example, one attractor with period 2 (.0̄1̄/.1̄0̄, ⅓ and
⅔), two attractors with period 3 (.001… and .011…), 3 attractors with
period 4 (.0001…, .0011…, .0111…), 6 attractors with period 5
(.00001…, .00011…, .00101…, .00111…, .01011…, .01111…), and so on.</p>
<p>So all rational numbers are periodic in the dyadic map.  <em>But all
irrational numbers are aperiodic</em>, and almost all numbers are
irrational.  And so if you perturb a rational number by a small
nonzero amount, you are almost certain to land on an irrational
number.  So an analog circuit implementation of the dyadic map, which
is subject to noise, should behave chaotically rather than get stuck
in a fixed point.</p>
<p>How can we implement the dyadic map in the time domain?  Well, we can
convert a sampling time x to a voltage 2x mod 1 by sampling a sawtooth
with a period of 1 and a slope of 2, in whatever units we’re using.
And then to convert from the voltage back to the sampling time, we
just use it as the starting voltage for a ramp generator that ramps ⅓
as fast.</p>
<p>(It’s ⅓ as fast because it has to finish up the current oscillation of
the sawtooth too.)</p>
<p>So, for example, suppose we sample the sawtooth at time 0.231.  Its
voltage is 0.231, and so we start our other ramp generator at V=0.231.
At time 1, it has reached 0.4873; at time 2, it has reached 0.8207;
and then at time 2.538, it reaches 1 and triggers another sample of
the sawtooth.  Now the sawtooth’s voltage is 0.538, so the other ramp
falls to 0.538 and grows back up toward 1, which takes 1.386 time
units, reaching voltage 1 at time 3.924 and triggering an additional
sample of V=0.924.  And so it goes: 0.231, 2.538, 3.924, 4.151, 6.698,
etc.</p>
<p>Note that this is not the dyadic map!  0.538 is not 2·0.231 % 1.
Rather, 0.538 = 2·(1-0.231) % 1.  This is an <em>inverted</em> dyadic map.
It preserves the properties of the original when it comes to which
points lead to periodic orbits, but the periods change.</p>
<p>We can do better than that, though.  A ramp generator or a sawtooth
generator requires a constant-current source.  But actually an
exponential decay works just as well for this, as long as the
exponential decay on the sampling-generator signal is three times as
long.  You can think of the exponential thing as just a distortion on
your oscilloscope.  So an RC circuit is a perfectly adequate
substitute for a ramp generator here.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
