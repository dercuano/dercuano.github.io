<p>Here’s a specification for sorting:</p>
<pre><code>A. sorted(x) is some permutation p of x such that ∀i∈[0, #p-1): ¬ pᵢ &gt; pᵢ₊₁.
</code></pre>
<p>Given a way of enumerating the permutations of a finite sequence and
some relation <code>&gt;</code>, this specification A is executable: you can
enumerate all the permutations of x, and if you find one that
satisfies <code>∀i∈[0, #p-1): ¬ pᵢ &gt; pᵢ₊₁</code>, you return it.</p>
<p>You can consider this algorithm, or an implementation of it for a
given machine, a refinement of specification A, specialized for a
given permutation-enumeration algorithm, data type, and ordering
relation.  You can write a proof that this plan correctly implements
specification A, which is to say, it’s a refinement of it.  It isn’t a
very efficient plan, since it takes superexponential time in the worst
case; you can also write a proof of that.</p>
<p>There isn’t a clean separation between programs, algorithms, plans,
and specifications; you can continue refining and specializing that
specification toward something executable on a particular machine.
Let’s call the brute-force sorting algorithm that you would thus
derive specification B.</p>
<p>(Some specifications may be uncomputable; for example, if you specify
that a program should be fun to use, or compute Chaitin’s number omega
for a flavor of Turing machine, you will not be able to execute those
specifications, even inefficiently.  Even if the specification says to
find a real number for which some potentially computable property
holds, that may be uncomputable if the number itself is uncomputable.
But if the specification says to find a computable real number for
which the property holds, if one exists, then you can satisfy that
specification by enumerating all possible programs.  Henceforth I will
disregard such uncomputable specifications in this essay.)</p>
<p>Given the premise that your relation <code>&gt;</code> (or rather its negation
<code>≤</code>) is at least a weak partial order, you can write a proof that such
a sorted permutation exists.  Also, you can write a proof that the
original specification implies that <code>¬∃i: p₀ &gt; pᵢ</code>, and that all the
subsequences of <code>p</code> are sorted versions of themselves, including in
particular <code>p[1:]</code>, if it exists.</p>
<p>Given these (plus a couple more things), you can also write a proof
that the following specification is equivalent to, and thus a
refinement of, specification A:</p>
<pre><code>C. sorted(x) is some permutation p of x such that ¬∃i: p₀ &gt; pᵢ
   and, if x is nonempty, p[1:] = sorted(p[1:]).
</code></pre>
<p>With a naïve backtracking search, this leads fairly quickly to
selection sort, given a proof of the usual linear-time minimum-finding
algorithm; this is already a much more efficient sort.  And you can
write a proof of that.  Let’s call this algorithm specification D.</p>
<p>(I’ve been writing <code>sorted(x)</code> as if it were a function, but of course
it is a relation; it is a bit of an abuse of notation to say that
<code>p[1:] = sorted(p[1:])</code>.)</p>
<p>There are several characteristics of what we are doing here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Specifications are written in a form that is entirely independent
   of the other relations and data they are defined in terms of.
   Specification A does not say that <code>&gt;</code> is a weak partial order, or
   that <code>x</code> is a finite sequence, or what algorithm to use to
   enumerate permutations.  Instead, somewhere else, we write a proof
   that, IF <code>&gt;</code> is a weak partial order, THEN specification A
   describes a nonempty set of permutations, and also specification B
   is equivalent to specification A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some specifications are refinements of others, in the
   sense that they logically imply the specifications they are
   refinements of.  Some of these refinement relations are only valid
   given certain premises, which amount to specializations of a
   specification.  Some of these refinements are derived
   automatically; others are written by hand and then proved to be
   refinements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some specifications are sufficiently specific that we can prove
   efficiency properties about them, such as specifications B and D;
   others are not, such as specifications A and C.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can take as an analogy the process a SQL database uses to evaluate
queries.  First we write a specification in SQL of the query we want
to run; then the database derives a plan that it proves is a
refinement of our query — in this case, the plan will produce a
specific sequence of tuples that is one of the sequences of tuples
that would be a correct response to our query.  We can understand much
of compilation in this fashion, as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, we can do generic programming in this way.</p>
<p>What I’m describing here is very different from the usual programming
process.  Normally, we write a given subroutine only once, and we mix
premises about what kind of data it’s operating on and which other
operations it’s invoking in with the code.  The compiler might derive
a refinement of it for a given machine, but we don’t derive them
ourselves, and the compiler doesn’t provide us with a proof that the
machine code is a sound refinement of our source code, nor does it
prove efficiency properties of the machine code.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
