(13 minutes)</div><p>We should totally have a way to render HTML-style links in terminal
emulators.</p>
<h2>Why this is a good idea</h2>
<p>Lots of terminal emulators already have a way to recognize URLs in
free text so that you can visit them (ctrl-click in gnome-terminal, an
option on the dropdown menu in both gnome-terminal and Konsole), which
is useful.  But if you're chatting over XMPP with someone who's using
HTML (like HipChat), they're probably going to embed links from time
to time.  And they expect that when they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We'll go from my house to Facebook at around 10:00.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where "my house" is linked to
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=1456+Edgewood+Dr.,+Palo+Alto,+CA&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x808fbb0d745a65e9:0xfde4b05151805922,1456+Edgewood+Dr,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94301&amp;gl=us&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bZNCUbbuI62g4AOPyYDQDw&amp;ved=0CDAQ8gEwAA">http://maps.google.com/maps?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=1456+Edgewood+Dr.,+Palo+Alto,+CA&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x808fbb0d745a65e9:0xfde4b05151805922,1456+Edgewood+Dr,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94301&amp;gl=us&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bZNCUbbuI62g4AOPyYDQDw&amp;ved=0CDAQ8gEwAA</a>

<h2>The proposed solution: <code>ESC [ _</code> and <code>ESC [ U &lt; url &gt;</code></h2>
<p>We define two new ANSI-compatible escape sequences, which ought to be
proposed for the next version of ECMA-48 and the corresponding ISO
standard:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CSI _</code>, or <code>ESC [ _</code>, "LNK": to indicate the beginning of a
  hyperlink to an URL.  All characters produced before the next URL
  sequence form part of the link.</li>
<li><code>CSI U</code>, or <code>ESC [ U</code>, "URL": to indicate the end of the link text
  begun by LNK.  This sequence is followed by the unencoded text of
  the URL to which clicking the link should take the user, preceded by
  "&lt;" and terminating before the next "&gt;" or " ", which is part of the
  escape sequence and not displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, a link labeled "Canonical Hackers" linking to
<a href="http://canonical.org/">http://canonical.org/</a> could be represented as follows, with <code>ESC</code>
representing the ASCII escape character:</p>
<pre><code>ESC[_Canonical HackersESC[U&lt;http://canonical.org/&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale for the design of the escape sequence</h2>
<p>Above and beyond the typographical possibilities of whitespace, we
already have boldface, underlining, and different colors in our
terminal emulators.  These are produced by "escape sequences",
invisible sequences of characters typically beginning with the ESC
character (character 27) followed by a "[", which change the state of
the terminal so that subsequently displayed characters will have a
different effect.  The <code>ESC[</code> sequence is called "CSI", "Control
Sequence Introducer".</p>
<p>So I think we should define an escape sequence to make the following
(or preceding?)  sequence of characters into a clickable link to a
given URL.</p>
<p>It would be desirable if the escape sequence degraded into something
that was human-readable when displayed on terminals that didn't
support it.  This is only possible to a limited extent, since programs
that try to be aware of screen layout will necessarily be confused
about where the text is on the screen, but it is still somewhat
possible.</p>
<p>ANSI escape sequences can't contain sequences of arbitrary characters,
while URLs can contain most characters.  Consequently the escape
sequences for setting the terminal title aren't ANSI escape sequences:
<code>ESC]0;new title^G</code>, where <code>^G</code> is the BEL character control-G
(character 7) and can also be <code>ESC\</code>, and <code>0</code> can be replaced with
<code>1</code> or <code>2</code>.  The <code>ESC]</code> sequence is known as "OSC" or "Operating
System Command".</p>
<p>xterm's parsing of the above sequence seems to consume anything
following <code>ESC]</code> until the next <code>^G</code> or <code>ESC\</code>, even if it doesn't
start with a digit, which is pretty unfriendly.  This suggests that if
we wanted to use the same <code>ESC]</code> introduction sequence, incompatible
xterm implementations would eat the URL if we terminated it with the
same <code>^G</code>, and other things as well if we used a different terminator.
Even if most people are now using other terminal emulators, this seems
like a compatibility trap.</p>
<p>Putting the link escape sequence <em>after</em> rather than <em>before</em> the text
to be marked up offers a certain kind of safety; it's quite easy for
an unterminated color escape sequence to set the next few pages of
output to white on white, or flashing, or underlined, or whatnot.  It
also probably improves matters on terminals that don't yet understand
the escape sequence, as they could see
"Canonical<a href="http://canonical.org/">http://canonical.org/</a>" rather than
"<a href="http://canonical.org">http://canonical.org</a>Canonical".  Since you presumably need two
escape sequences anyway to indicate the boundary of the link, you
might as well put the URL in the final one.  So you have one escape
sequence to indicate "beginning of link" and another one to indicate
"end of link; URL is xyz".</p>
<p>For reasons of tradition and URL-safety, I would like the delimiters
(particularly in the gracefully degraded form) to be <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.  Ideally
the beginning and ending sequences would also have a pleasing visual
and memorable symmetry, and would disappear from view entirely in old
terminals.</p>
<p>(In the following, <code>ESC</code> means the ASCII character 27, escape.)</p>
<p>This suggests using one of the ASCII matching delimiter pairs
<code>[](){}&lt;&gt;`'</code>.  <code>[]</code> are right out, since they're already in use.
<code>ESC(</code> and <code>ESC)</code> cause rxvt to swallow the following character; I'm
not sure what their meaning is, but they seem to be used.
Treating <code>`'</code> as a matched pair is sadly out of style, due to the unfortunate
but now nearly universal adoption from Microsoft Windows fonts of a
vertical <code>'</code>.</p>
<p><code>ESC{</code> and <code>ESC}</code> disappear in rxvt and xterm, render as literal ESC
character glyphs in gnome-terminal, overlaid on top of the {} in my
font, and disappear in konsole while producing warning messages on its
stderr.  <code>ESC&lt;</code> and <code>ESC&gt;</code> disappear in rxvt; the second disappears in
gnome-terminal, while the first renders as a literal ESC character
glyph; they disappear in konsole.  This suggests that perhaps <code>ESC&lt;</code>
and <code>ESC&gt;</code> are already taken.</p>
<p>A little looking around suggests that <code>ESC&gt;</code> is "set numeric keypad
mode" aka DECKPNM on VT100s, <code>ESC&lt;</code> is "exit ANSI mode" on VT52s,
while <code>ESC(</code> and <code>ESC)</code> are used by VT100s to change character sets
(setaltg0, setaltg1, etc.)</p>
<p><code>ESC}</code> on VT100s is "invoke the G2 character set", according to
<a href="http://rtfm.etla.org/xterm/ctlseq.html">http://rtfm.etla.org/xterm/ctlseq.html</a>, although that's ignored in
xterm and probably all other modern terminal emulators.</p>
<p>So this suggests the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>ESC{Canonical.ESC}&lt;http://canonical.org/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, though, you could use valid ANSI escape sequences instead of
<code>ESC{</code> and <code>ESC}</code>.  I wanted to use <code>ESC[a</code> for the "begin link"
sequence (like <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>), but rxvt already uses it for a nonstandard
"move right" sequence, an alternative spelling of <code>ESC[C</code>.  (See
rxvt-2.6.4/src/command.c:2652, inside <code>process_csi_seq</code>.)  The full
set of CSI-ending codes handled by rxvt seems to be
<code>iAeBCaDEFG`dHfIZJK@LMXPT^ScmnrshltgW</code>, which is to say,
<code>@ABCDEFGHIJKLMPSTWXZ^`acdefghilmnrst</code>.</p>
<p>Argh, so what to use for the other escape sequence?  Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For two character sequences, the second character is in the range
ASCII 64 to 95 (@ to _). However, most of the sequences are more
than two characters, and start with the characters ESC and [ (left
bracket). This sequence is called CSI for Control Sequence
Introducer (or Control Sequence Initiator). The final character of
these sequences is in the range ASCII 64 to 126 (@ to ~).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests that we could use "ESC[<em>", which konsole reports as an
"Undecodable sequence" and drops, rxvt apparently drops (and isn't in
rxvt's list of CSI codes), xterm and screen drop, and gnome-terminal
displays literally.  "ESC[</em>" is nice and mnemonic: links are normally
underlined.</p>
<p><code>ESC[U</code> would work for the "end link, begin URL" sequence, which could
be followed by the URL wrapped in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.  If the URL is specified to
end at the next space or <code>&gt;</code>, then this sequence would be unlikely to
inadvertently gobble up a large quantity of text when random data is
sent to the terminal that randomly happens to include <code>ESC[U</code>.  So
that would give us:</p>
<pre><code>ESC[_Canonical.ESC[U&lt;http://canonical.org/&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Implementing the escape sequence</h2>
<p>You could write your own terminal emulator to support links, but it
probably makes more sense to implement the feature in existing
terminal-emulation software.  The popular free-software terminal
emulators are tmux, screen, gnome-terminal, konsole, rxvt, xterm,
Emacs, and whatever Apple ships, plus perhaps implementation in
ncurses is necessary for much application software to use it.</p>
<p>I looked through the available file on my Ubuntu box to see what other
terminal emulators there are.  The relevant popularity metrics from

</code></pre>
<p>(I thought Text::CharWidth might be relevant, but it doesn't seem to
handle escape sequences anyway.)</p>
<p>Now, libvte9 or libvte-2.90-9 is the actual terminal emulator library
that powers a number of the above terminal emulators, at least
gnome-terminal, sakura, xfce4-terminal, vala-terminal, tilda,
lxterminal, gtkterm, and evilvte.  But from looking at the code of
gnome-terminal and xfce4-terminal, each separate application built on
top of libvte would probably have to write some code to handle clicks
on link regions.</p>
<p>It seems that once you add the feature to libncurses5 (in the termcap,
at least), libvte9, and gnome-terminal, it's available to 20% of users
of Debian and similar systems; if you add it to xterm, you get another
12%, although it's perhaps dubious whether upstream xterm will accept
such a patch; adding the feature to screen makes it available to
another 9%, although some of them will still be using other terminals
(such as MacOS X terminal) to connect to their screen; konsole gets
another 6%; emacs ansi-color.el 4%; xfce4-terminal 3%; and tmux 1.6%.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Some escape sequences of the past have been disabled for security
reasons in modern software.  However, in general, it's safe to launch
arbitrary URLs in a normal browser at the moment, or so we believe; so
this should be safe.  It may, however, result in terminal users
getting rickrolled.  It would be useful to have a way to see what the
linked URL is before you click on it.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/utopias.html">Utopias: proposals unlikely to be realized for improving things</a> (19 notes)
