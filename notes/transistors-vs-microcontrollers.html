(8 minutes)</div><p>I was just looking at the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATTINY13A-SN/1611-ATTINY13A-SN-ND/6829763">ATTiny13A</a> on Digi-Key, the one in an
8-pin SOIC.  It costs 33–40¢, depending on quantity, has six GPIO
pins, runs at anything up to 20 MHz (or 0.128, 4.8, or 9.6 MHz on the
internal RC oscillator), and can source or sink 20 mA per output pin,
up to a max of 60 mA across all the pins.  Its input pin bias current
is 1 μA.  It has the usual assortment of AVR peripherals, cut down a
bit: one 8-bit timer/counter with two PWM channels, a separate
watchdog, a 10-bit ADC with an internal voltage reference (same speed as
the one on ATMega328, 15ksps at max resolution), and a comparator.
It only has a kilobyte of
Flash and 64 bytes of RAM.  It’s 5.4 mm × 5.35 mm ×
2.2 mm in the SOIC version.</p>
<p>So far this sounds like a pretty wimpy microcontroller, even if it is
an AVR.  But I think maybe instead of comparing it to microcontrollers
I should compare it to transistors.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the same chip also comes in a much smaller MLF package
with 20 pins, which gives you 18 GPIOs instead of 6.  And the ATTiny5
costs 17¢ now, but is limited to half the memory, 12MHz, and 8 bits of
ADC resolution, but has a 16-bit timer — in 2 mm × 2 mm.)</p>
<p>(And the STM32F031x4/6 comes in a WLCSP25 package that is 2.5 mm ×
2.4 mm and has 20 GPIOs, or 18 GPIOs and an I²C interface, or 16 GPIOs
and an SPI interface.  It can handle somewhat less current or voltage
than the AVRs but is not at all wimpy, rather the opposite.  I think
it costs 56¢ but I may have it confused with a larger package of the
same chip.)</p>
<p>For example, a 2N7002T-2 MOSFET costs US$0.51 (or down to 9.4¢ in
quantity 1000), about 30% more than the microcontroller (again, in
quantity 1).  It can switch 115 mA at up to 60 volts, a much higher
voltage than the microcontroller but less than twice the current, and
its input bias current is 0.1 μA, ten times higher.  It can do analog
things the AVR can’t.  But you need 10 volts to turn it all the way
on, it can only reasonably be used up to a few megahertz, and its
biggest disadvantage is that it has only one input and one output.</p>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, you could replace as many as six
2N7002s (US$3) with a single ATTiny13A (US$0.40).  That’s nearly an
order of magnitude cheaper, and it’s smaller too.</p>
<p>But maybe it’s unfair to compare the microcontroller to power MOSFETs,
even lightweight ones like the 2N7002.  Maybe you should be comparing
it to small-signal transistors, like a 300MHz MMBT3904, which only
costs 10¢ and can handle 200 mA at up to 40 V, or a 12¢ BC849, which
is 30V and 100mA, which is good to 100MHz.  But those still cost more
per output pin than the microcontroller.  And typically they come in a
SOT-23 package, which is 2.9 mm × 1.3 mm × 1 mm, larger than many of
the microcontroller packages mentioned above.</p>
<p>It seems like if you just want to turn things on and off, even very
fast, the microcontroller is best up to 60 mA at 5 volts — 300
milliwatts — and perhaps 5 megahertz out, 7 kilohertz analog in.  If
you need higher voltage, higher current, analog output, or higher
frequency, then maybe you should go with discrete transistors or
perhaps other ICs.</p>
<p>This suggests a real potential niche for microcontrollers with
open-drain GPIO outputs, which could potentially directly switch much
higher-power loads — I suspect 60 V at 20 mA wouldn’t be unreasonable,
and would be over a watt without dissipating any more power in the μC
itself than an ATTiny does.  Hmm, and any I²C/TWI interface already
has open-drain hardware... I wonder if it’s possible to take advantage
of this?</p>
<p>The STM32 line of microcontrollers has 5V-tolerant GPIO pins that can
be configured as open-drain, but the datasheet warns not to try to run
them over 5.5V, and gives Vdd+4V as the “absolute maximum”.  So 60 V
is probably unwise.</p>
<p>An interesting question is how you design things to make this
potential advantage real.  What kind of software do you run on the
microcontroller?  How much autonomy do you give it?  How do you divide
up the functionality of a complex device among different
microcontrollers?</p>
<p>A difficulty with these super tiny devices with 4 or 6 GPIOs is that
you don’t have much left over for communication.  An ATtiny48, by
contrast, has 24 or 28 GPIOs (depending on the package), and three of
them suffice for SPI at 3 Mbps.  In between 21 remaining GPIOs, you
could plausibly charlieplex 441 LEDs, which would be a pretty decent
chunk of transistors, or run 10 tiny DC motors in an H-bridge
configuration.  These packages, not counting the DIP, range from 7 mm
square to 4 mm square.</p>
<hr />
<p>Other possible chips are reasonable alternatives to microcontrollers.
There are I²C GPIO extenders, for example, and there are op-amp chips,
and there are shift registers, and maybe you could use JTAG.  The
LM7321 op-amp comes in a SOT-23 (1.75 mm wide, 3.05 mm long, not
counting the pins) or dual in a 8-pin VSSOP (3 mm square) or SOIC.</p>
<p>An amusing possible alternative is to use some kind of voltage
regulator — Horowitz &amp; Hill suggest treating an LM317 as a cheaper
alternative to the LM395 “protected transistor”, with “-1.2 V
base-to-emitter voltage and 50 μA pullup base current,” and mention
using 7805s in a similar way despite their annoyingly large
base-to-emitter voltage.  But you should also be able to use a buck or
boost converter in this way, generating a sort of class-D amplifier.</p>
<p>GPIO extenders include the Microchip MCP23008, which Digi-Key
classifies as “<a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/interface-i-o-expanders/749">Interface — I/O Expanders</a>”, a category with 1643
chips in it.  These are mostly SPI and I²C with 8 or 16 pins and can
sink or source a few tens of mA.  They tend to cost about
50–100¢. Examples include the 129¢ TI TCA9534APWR, a 400kHz I²C
16-TSSOP (4.4mm square) with 8 push-pull GPIOs that runs anywhere from
1.65–5 V; the 144¢ Semtech SX1502I087TRT, a 400kHz I²C 20QFN (3mm
square) with 8 push-pull GPIOs of 8mA source, 24mA sink capacity at
anywhere from 1.2 to 5.5 V; and the 150¢ TI TCA9535PWR, a 400kHz I²C
24TSSOP (4.4mm) with 16 push-pull GPIOs of 10 mA source, 25 mA sink at
anywhere from 1.65 to 5.5 V; the MCP23008-E/ML, a 113¢ I²C 20QFN (4 mm
square) with 8 push-pull GPIOs of 25 mA source or sink at anywhere
from 1.8V to 5.5V; and the obsolete 5MHz SPI NXP PCA9701D,112, with 16
input-only pins, in a 7.5mm 24-SOIC.  (All prices from Digi-Key in
quantity 1.)</p>
<p>The thing to notice here is that the price per GPIO here is 16¢, 18¢,
9.4¢, 14¢, and ∞¢, respectively.  While this is reasonable compared to
the price of a whole discrete transistor, it compares unfavorably with
the price of GPIOs on a full-fledged microcontroller.  And the size,
too, compares unfavorably.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
