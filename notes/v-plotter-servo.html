(3 minutes)</div><p>I was thinking you could use webcam streaming video to provide
servoing feedback on a hanging V-plotter.  I mean, you could use it to
provide servoing feedback for any kind of robot (at least for things
that don’t need &lt;30ms or so latency) but V-plotters (aka polargraphs,
drawbots, wall-plotters, etc.) are particularly promising.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of V-potter videos on YouTube, including some which
are just video from a fixed point of view, in real time, without any
change in point of view.  These are not the most interesting or
informative videos to watch as a human being, but they make it
possible to test this concept before actually having built a
V-plotter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU9SaCFnCng">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU9SaCFnCng</a> shows a deformable,
swinging V-plotter, more rapidly than real-time, with changes in
lighting in the room, for a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyLPpGdfR7s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyLPpGdfR7s</a> is 5 minutes from a
fixed point of view of a somewhat wobbly V-plotter, from a fixed point
of view, with lots of texture in the background and a few distractors.
Midway through a guy walks in front of the camera, and the lighting
changes.  Toward the end, the lighting changes again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5rxxGuWUo8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5rxxGuWUo8</a> has a minute or so in
the middle of a somewhat wobbly V-plotter drawing on a shiny
whiteboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojcZ7kcklu4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojcZ7kcklu4</a> is a sped-up video of a
Polargraph drawing Spider-Man, from a single point of view.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiw3hkDvp-M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiw3hkDvp-M</a> has about a minute of a
Polargraph drawing some classic art, sped up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qury-0BiURA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qury-0BiURA</a> has another few minutes
of a Polargraph drawing.  The camera moves a bit toward the end, and
lighting flickers throughout.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbpT907qIHg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbpT907qIHg</a> has a couple of
1-minute-or-so sequences of time-lapse drawing, each from a different
points of view.  This one uses fishing line for the V, which means the
strings won’t interfere with tracking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG70TvuRU9Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG70TvuRU9Y</a> has a couple of
30-second-or-so sped-up segments of a V-plotter drawing from fixed
points of view, one with changing lighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z8LTj74uiE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z8LTj74uiE</a> is almost a minute of
sped-up footage of a V-plotter with a novel design and substantial
parallax.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BOuqLPaEMc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BOuqLPaEMc</a> is a very short video of
a V-plotter made out of a binder clip.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7sCiv7VTE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7sCiv7VTE</a> is a particularly tricky
case: the V-plotter gondola is made from a CD-R, which means that its
reflection is almost entirely specular, and furthermore has
diffraction rainbows all over it.  The video runs in apparently real
time for about six minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmCWx30g7Ks">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmCWx30g7Ks</a> is a whiteboard
V-plotter in real time for about two minutes.  It’s rather blurry.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jknm5qtgO1A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jknm5qtgO1A</a> is another blurry
whiteboard V-plotter in real time (except for occasional jumps), with
conspicuous hanging cables.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4KyPN0sw0A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4KyPN0sw0A</a> is a V-plotter using a
spray-paint can that appears to be using the Hektor constant-speed
path-design software.  Its speed varies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OselyTkA6wU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OselyTkA6wU</a> seems to be Hektor
itself, running in real time for some minutes.</p>
<p>On another topic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycrGUTGlzik">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycrGUTGlzik</a> shows
the design of the PolargraphSD gondola that keeps its wobble so low.
It uses cartridge bearings to pivot the two strings around the precise
XY center of the gondola.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/manufacturing.html">Manufacturing</a> (50 notes)
