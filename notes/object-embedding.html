<p>In Java (as in Smalltalk, Lisp, Python, ML, and many other languages)
when an object A “contains” an object B, the in-RAM representation of
object A contains actually just a <em>pointer</em> to B, i.e. the address at
which B’s in-RAM representation can be found.  This is in some ways
convenient, but it has some drawbacks — not only for efficiency, but
even for program correctness.</p>
<p>In C, instead, “A containing B” means that the in-RAM representation
of B is actually contained inside the in-RAM representation of A.  I
don’t know of a standard term for this, so I’m calling this “object
embedding.”  (Object embedding is one aspect of one possible
implementation of what is sometimes called “compound value types”, for
example in C# and in <em>Elements of Programming</em>.)  C, C++, Pascal, and
Golang do the same thing; they all inherit it from COBOL’s “group
items”, from which Algol got “record types”, which C renamed “struct”.</p>
<p>The benefits of by-reference object fields are significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>A’s <strong>reference to B is polymorphic</strong>, i.e. you can use an object of
  any subclass of the type that A is expecting.  This means that
  objects-by-reference are absolutely essential to the Liskov
  Substitution Principle.  C++ has a terrible bug resulting from its
  misguided attempt to make embedded objects polymorphic, known as the
  “slicing copy”.  C, Pascal, and Golang do not suffer from this
  because embeddable objects do not have subtypes, unless you think of
  the variants of a union type (“sum type”) as being subtypes of it.</li>
<li>B can be <strong>aliased</strong>: several different objects A can “contain” the
  same object B.  This can be desirable if B is large or if it has
  mutable state that many objects need access to.</li>
<li>A’s reference to B is <strong>nullable</strong>, which is particularly important
  in languages like Smalltalk, C++, and Java, where you can access an
  incompletely initialized object (from inside its constructor, if
  nothing else).</li>
<li>Pointers allow circular references.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, compared to Java’s approach, it occurs to me that the
embedding approach has some real benefits.  More than once, I’ve
written code like this:</p>
<pre><code>public class LogFileParser {
    private Map&lt;String, String&gt; messageIds;
    public void sawMessageId(String messageId, String queueId) {
        messageIds.put(queueId, messageId);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This has the tendency to throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>, because of
course declaring that your LogFileParser objects <em>could</em> have a <code>Map</code>
from <code>String</code>s to <code>String</code>s doesn’t give them one.  You need to say:</p>
<pre><code>    private Map&lt;String, String&gt; messageIds =
        new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
</code></pre>
<p><code>final</code> on instance variables is not nearly as useful as you might
think when you’re obligated to use mutable objects for a lot of those
final instance variables.  It does, however, avoid the above problem.</p>
<p>By contrast, embedded objects aren’t nullable.  If you say:</p>
<pre><code>struct foo {
    struct foo *next;
    struct bar my_bar;
    int weight;
};
</code></pre>
<p>then you can never have a <code>struct foo</code> whose <code>my_bar</code> is <code>NULL</code>,
because it’s not a pointer.  So the above NullPointerException cannot
arise, not even as a compile error.  In C++ you can even have a
default constructor for <code>bar</code> that ensures that its memory doesn’t
contain random garbage; in Golang it’s initially zero, and you get the
same guarantee in C if you use <code>calloc</code> or initialize a local <code>struct
foo f = {0};</code>.</p>
<p>The consequence is that in C++, if you say</p>
<pre><code>std::map&lt;string, string&gt; message_ids;
</code></pre>
<p>— either as a local variable or an instance variable — you have a
full-fledged empty <code>map</code> sitting there, without any need to repeat
again the fact that you wanted one.  This kind of thing, in
combination with the STL container library, allows you to write entire
useful C++ programs that don’t mention heap memory allocation at all,
because it’s all hidden away inside the STL.</p>
<p>(ML and its descendants take another approach to this problem, one
which inspired the <code>final</code> mechanism in Java: although relationships
by objects are by means of pointers, there is no <code>null</code> value, and so
you can’t create an object without supplying values for all of its
fields.)</p>
<p>Aside from this <strong>implicit nullability imposed on every object
field</strong>, there are a few other problems with by-reference objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>They allow for aliasing</strong>, which is to say, many-to-one
  relationships: a subobject included merely by reference can also be
  included in many other objects.  Sometimes this is what you want —
  it’s a major reason for using pointers in languages that do support
  object embedding — but aliasing, like nullability, is bug-prone, and
  therefore <strong>probably a bad default</strong> for mutable objects.</p>
<p>(Of the languages I’ve mentioned, only Pascal actually forbids you
from making an alias to an object embedded inside another object,
e.g. in C, writing <code>&amp;my_foo.my_bar</code>.  But it’s relatively uncommon in
practice to store such a reference into another object.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They <strong>greatly increase the number of separate memory
  allocations</strong>.  This means that the graph that your garbage collector
  has to traverse is very much larger, and it correspondingly must do a
  great deal more work.  This is one reason why ML garbage collectors
  tend to be very efficient — they have to be to make ML practical at
  all — and also the reason that Golang is reasonably efficient even
  though its garbage collector is still kind of crappy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In themselves, the <strong>pointers take up memory</strong>.  If the only
  pointers in your memory are for object fields that you decided <em>ought</em>
  to be nullable or aliasable, then most of your memory will probably be
  spent on the data that your program unavoidably has to manage.  By
  contrast, in a language like Java or Python, it’s easy to spend most
  of your memory on pointers, especially on 64-bit CPUs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Having more pointers also makes the garbage collector’s job a lot
  harder, since it has to traverse the pointers in your live objects.)</p>
<p>Quantitatively, it seems that half to two-thirds of a typical Java
  program’s memory is taken up by pointers, because <a href="https://wikis.oracle.com/display/HotSpotInternals/CompressedOops">moving to 64-bit
  increases the needed heap size by 50%</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CPUs <strong>can’t generally prefetch pointer targets</strong>, and they
  won’t be in the same cache line; so accessing subobjects is a lot more
  likely to generate cache misses.  By contrast, accessing embedded
  subobjects takes not only <em>less</em> time, but often <em>zero</em> instructions
  and zero time!  See the section below, “zero instructions”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocating every object on the heap means that <strong>any part of your
  program that creates objects can fail unpredictably</strong> if you run out
  of memory; in very memory-restricted environments like an Arduino,
  the heap can start to overwrite the stack and vice versa.  Error
  handling mechanisms can control how the failure is handled, but they
  can’t turn failure into success.  (Worse, if your error handling
  creates objects, it can fail too.)  In practice, under many
  circumstances, it’s probably better to recover from memory
  allocation failures by <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/blogs/753">immediately aborting the program</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds like a bigger problem than it is in practice, because
  most software can be called upon to handle arbitrarily-sized
  problems, which means that you can always find some way to make it
  run out of memory and fail.  Dynamic memory allocation is built into
  the problem, not just your solution to it.  So increasing the number
  of places you can get an out-of-memory error isn’t a big deal.</p>
<p>But there is some software that needs to work <em>all the time</em> instead
  of sometimes failing unpredictably, and that software should be
  written without dynamic allocation, which means it should not be
  written in a language where object fields are by reference.  It’s
  not acceptable if your antilock braking system, your jet engine
  controller, or your air-traffic control system gets an out-of-memory
  exception and reboots while you’re using it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it’s okay for your software to fail every once
  in a while, and it’s just a matter of reducing the frequency to once
  a day, once a year, or once a millennium, dynamic allocation is not
  a big deal.  In fact, dynamic allocation can help a lot with that.
  One of the major reasons the Fuzz paper found that the GNU tools
  were so much more reliable than the Unix tools they replaced is that
  they use dynamic allocation all over the place, so they have few
  arbitrary limits.  Every dynamic allocation is a potential failure
  in your program; but every arbitrary limit is a potential bug.</p>
<p>However, these disadvantages are irrelevant if you want to practice
OOP, because if you don’t have ubiquitous LSP polymorphism, you aren’t
practicing OOP.  So, in a way, these can be seen as five disadvantages
of OOP.</p>
<p>(In theory I don’t see why you couldn’t have a functional programming
language where object embedding was the norm, but I haven’t seen one.
Perhaps this is because functional programming languages have mostly
adopted other approaches to solving the problems here that are not
questions of mere efficiency: for nullability, sum types like ML’s
<code>Option</code> or Haskell’s <code>Maybe</code> and constructor expressions; for
aliasing, a default of immutability; and, to some extent, for garbage
collection, sophisticated generational garbage collectors.)</p>
<h2>Parametric polymorphism</h2>
<p>One big disadvantage of object embedding is that it requires you to
implement parametric polymorphism (aka generics, generic types, or
parametrized types) by means of generative programming, which can
create a combinatorial explosion in code size.  ML-family languages
get parametric polymorphism basically for free, because every value is
the size of a machine word (ironic that the 1980s explosion of
functional programming traces back to Backus’s misplaced attack on the
“conceptual von Neumann bottleneck”!)  so you only need one copy of
the machine code for <code>List.map</code>, not one copy for each size of list
item.</p>
<h2>Zero instructions!</h2>
<p>My assertion above that accessing embedded objects is not only cheap
but actually <em>free</em> may seem dubious.  What I mean is that, often,
what you’re doing with an embedded object is accessing fields within
it, and if those fields themselves are embedded objects, you can
easily end up with an entire chain of three or four or more field
accesses compiling down to a single indexed fetch instruction, rather
than a series of three or four of them.</p>
<p>As an example, in <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/aspmisc/my-very-first-raytracer.html">My Very First Raytracer</a>, I have a
function which begins:</p>
<pre><code>static bool
find_intersections(ray rr, sphere ss, sc *intersections)
{
  vec center_rel = sub(rr.start, ss.cp);
…
}
</code></pre>
<p>which invokes these functions:</p>
<pre><code>static vec
add(vec aa, vec bb) { vec rv = { aa.x+bb.x, aa.y+bb.y, aa.z+bb.z }; return rv; }
static vec
sub(vec aa, vec bb) { return add(aa, scale(bb, -1)); }
static vec
scale(vec vv, sc c) { vec rv = { vv.x*c, vv.y*c, vv.z*c }; return rv; }
</code></pre>
<p>So, given all this, the <code>center_rel</code> code works out to</p>
<pre><code>vec center_rel = { rr.start.x + ss.cp.x * -1,
                   rr.start.y + ss.cp.y * -1,
                   rr.start.z + ss.cp.z * -1 };
</code></pre>
<p>Even mild inlining optimization can turn that into six indexed memory
fetches and three subtractions, followed by three stores, but as far
as I can tell, GCC actually somehow manages to allocate an SSE
register to each of the six values, and so those 12 field accesses are
incorporated into three instructions.  (I can’t follow the generated
assembly at all, even with the aid of <code>-g -Wa,-adhlns=raytracer.lst</code>. 
GCC has inlined basically the entire raytracer program into a single
giant recursive function called <code>trace</code> of some 500-plus
instructions.)</p>
<p>Again, that’s 12 field accesses, plus some math, in 3 instructions,
thanks to object embedding.</p>
<h2>Further alternatives</h2>
<p>What was the name of that guy who advocated using parallel arrays in
C, Fortran-style?  He was also pretty unhappy about the decline in
hi-fi audio systems since the 1970s.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
