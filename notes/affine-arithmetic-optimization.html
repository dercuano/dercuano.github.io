(3 minutes)</div><p>Reduced affine arithmetic is an extension of interval arithmetic; it
is a nonstandard semantics method for evaluating a computable function
in the form f(x₀, x₁, x₂…xₙ) over some multidimensional interval x₀ ∈
(x₀₀, x₀₁), x₁ ∈ (x₁₀, x₁₁), … xₙ ∈ (xₙ₀, xₙ₁) to get a conservative
affine approximation k₀x₀ + k₁x₁ + … kₙxₙ ± kₙ₊₁ within which f is
guaranteed to be contained; for arithmetic expressions, it normally
takes a factor of n longer than simply evaluating the expression at a
point, and for regular functions, in the limit, the error term kₙ₊₁
diminishes quadratically with the interval size.</p>
<p>(Can we apply RAA recursively once to get a reduced affine
approximation of this error term, thus telling us which independent
variables are not contributing any significant approximation error,
and perhaps also getting a cheaper second-order approximation than the
full O(N²) representation?)</p>
<p>Mathematical optimization is the problem of finding the minimum of a
“cost function” of some “design variables” within some given “feasible
region”.  Usually this can be restricted to the problem of finding the
function’s global minimum, because we can modify the function to
guarantee its value outside the feasible region will be very large.</p>
<p>For perfectly linear functions, reduced affine arithmetic computes a
perfect approximation; it is only nonlinear operations such as
multiplication, division, or conditionals that contribute error.</p>
<p>(Can you apply RAA in other fields, such as GF(2)ⁿ with XOR, NOT, and
either AND or OR?  XXX GF(2)ⁿ isn’t a field, dude)</p>
<p>Here is an algorithm for using reduced affine arithmetic to find the
minimum of a function over some domain.</p>
<p>Begin with a single interval covering the entire feasible region,
perhaps (-∞, +∞) on every independent variable.  Compute the function
using reduced affine arithmetic over that interval.  Store it in a
min-heap of (interval, result) pairs indexed by least lower bound
(i.e. the lowest value the function can possibly achieve on that
interval).</p>
<p>At each step, select the interval with the smallest least lower bound.
Remove it from the min-heap and subdivide it in some way, for example
into three subintervals along a randomly selected axis.  Compute the
function for each subinterval, and insert the new subintervals into
the min-heap.</p>
<p>At any step, (one end of) the best interval on the heap is in some
sense our best guess at the true global minimum of the function, but
any other interval whose least lower bound overlaps its least upper
bound may actually be better.  However, once the difference between
the upper and lower bounds is within our desired tolerance, any one of
those intervals is an acceptable answer.</p>
<p>Note that, although it is not a gradient-descent optimization
algorithm, it is still an anytime algorithm.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/math.html">Math</a> (78 notes)
