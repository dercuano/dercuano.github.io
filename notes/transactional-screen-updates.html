(10 minutes)</div><p>So I was thinking about one of my usual hobbyhorses: how to design an
entire usably efficient interactive computing system as a pure
function of some mutable, but in some way orderly, state.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The basic idea goes back to McCarthy’s “Elephant 2000” proposal, where
you define a data processing system in terms of keeping commitments
based on its past history, and then the compiler figures out what
information the data processing system needs to store about that past
history to comply with its commitments.  That is, the entire data
structure of the system is purely the result of compiler optimization.
You just make assertions about the relationships between past events
and the system’s outputs, and the compiler produces a running system
that satisfies those requirements.</p>
<p>I explored it a bit in “rumor-oriented programming”, where the idea
was that you accumulate an ever-growing history of “rumors” that get
automatically synchronized between your devices (because you only ever
add new ones, synchronization is trivial and guaranteed to be
convergent, though potentially expensive) and the actual screen you
see is the output of a query over that rumor history, using a query
language that doesn’t expose the order in which the rumors arrived on
the current device; then you have buttons and shit that add new rumors
and possibly cause like a recomputation of the query result you see on
the screen.</p>
<p>I also explored it a bit in “dependency-driven composition, or make
for websites”, where the idea is that you use a <code>make</code>-like build
process over a dependency graph of resources.  Some resources are
human-produced and editable, while others are produced on demand from
other resources, and then cached.</p>
<p>This is all closely related to functional reactive programming, which
is perhaps unsurprisingly (at long last!) getting a lot of attention
in the last couple of years in the JavaScript world, with React,
Angular, and Meteor all becoming suddenly popular.</p>
<h2>Automatic dependency detection</h2>
<p>A simpler model than <code>make</code> for dependency-driven recomputation in the
world of building software projects is <code>redo</code>, which was designed by
Daniel Bernstein and later implemented by Avery Pennarun.  The idea of
<code>redo</code>, as I understand it, is that the script to build a file <code>foo</code>
is contained in the file <code>foo.do</code>, which is a shell script which
recursively invokes <code>redo</code> to ensure that each of the things <code>foo</code>
depends on is up to date, and then does whatever it needs to do to
build <code>foo</code>.  Because <code>redo</code> knows that it was trying to build <code>foo</code>,
it can tell that each of those recursive calls represents an edge in
the dependency graph.</p>
<p>This is closely reminiscent of how optimistic STMs (software
transactional memories) detect transaction conflicts and automatically
retry the transactions.  Within a transaction, you read some set of
STM variables and write some other set of them, and the STM records
each of those sets; when the transaction goes to commit, it atomically
publishes your set of writes, but only if no transaction has written
to some variable that you read since the time that you read it.  If
so, your results are discarded and automatically retried.  (This is
also, I think, closely related to how speculative instruction
execution works in CPUs, although I don’t know the details.)</p>
<p>In a sense, the STM has concluded that since it’s possible all of the
writes could have a dependency on any of the reads, so it needs to
discard them and rerun the transaction if any of those variables that
have been read has changed.</p>
<p>This is very similar to how Meteor detects dependencies in its
dependency graph: if a Meteor-controlled reactive computation reads
from a reactive variable, that variable records a dependency, which it
can then choose to invalidate later.  Unlike <code>redo</code>, and similar to
optimistic STMs, this causes that reactive computation to be eagerly
rerun, a policy choice which I suspect can lead to exponential-time
execution from diamonds in the dataflow graph.</p>
<p>The delightful thing about this kind of tracking, taken advantage of
by all of Meteor, optimistic STMs, and <code>redo</code>, is that it doesn’t
depend at all on the internal functioning of the computation that it’s
re-executing; it only has to be able to re-execute it on demand and
intercept its I/O, and trust that it is deterministic.  You could even
imagine an “STM server” which provides these services over the
network, although it has to trust its clients to retry when they get a
commit rejected.</p>
<p>(I confess I haven’t actually used Meteor or <code>redo</code>, so I could be
totally confused about them.)</p>
<p>The other interesting thing about it is that, usually at least, you
can do a simple version of it with very little actual dependency
tracking.  You can just re-execute stuff blindly.  This is how
Pennarun bootstraps <code>redo</code>.</p>
<h2>Dependency-driven and immediate-mode GUIs</h2>
<p>So, what if we try to take this kind of thing all the way to pixels on
the screen?  Like, it would be super cool if I could write some kind
of straightforward computation over, I don’t know, an editor buffer of
text in some form, some kind of specification of where I’m scrolled to
in that text, and a font, that results in setting some pixels on the
screen, and results in smallish recomputations.  It would be even
better if I could, like, write a thing that parses HTML and CSS and
lays out boxes on the screen and draws glyphs into them, and have that
be able to automatically detect changes in the CSS and figure out
which parts of the screen they affected.</p>
<p>A crucial part of this is that if you want the dependency-tracking
overhead to be small, the dataflow graph probably has to be relatively
small, which means the nodes in it have to be fairly large; and if you
want a recomputation to be small, the nodes in it have to be
relatively small.  To be concrete, in the editor example, if there’s a
change to a part of the text that isn’t displayed on the screen, you’d
probably prefer to not have to recompute the entire screen contents
from scratch; and maybe if there’s a change on one line of the screen,
it would be nice to redisplay just that line.</p>
<p>There’s a somewhat relevant field of work called “immediate-mode
GUIs”, popular in videogames, where you don’t try to avoid redrawing
the screen, part of the reason being that in a videogame you typically
redraw the screen 60 or 120 times a second anyway.  Immediate-mode
GUIs don’t have data objects that stick around in memory in some kind
of nested window tree structure, the way regular (“retained-mode”)
GUIs do; instead you do things like this:</p>
<pre><code>set_drawing_background(start_button_background);
if (button(120, 200, 600, start_button_height, "Start!")) start_game();
</code></pre>
<p>which redraws the button in the specified position, with its possibly
updated height, and then checks to see if the user has just clicked
their mouse in it.  The button has no persistent existence in memory,
other than as pixels in the framebuffer that have changed color, but
while control flow is down inside of it, it exists on the stack and
can react to the mouse click.</p>
<p>I feel that immediate-mode GUIs are a lot easier to program — for
example, the above example doesn’t have to add an event listener to
redraw when <code>start_button_background</code> or <code>start_button_height</code> change,
nor does it have to worry about when to destroy the button object — 
and they use less RAM.</p>
<p>The analogy here is between immediate-mode and retained-mode graphics
systems.  <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> is immediate-mode; SVG is retained-mode.  Both
have their performance advantages.  One of the potential disadvantages
of immediate-mode drawing is that you have to draw all the pixels on
the screen every frame, even when they haven’t changed.</p>
<p>So, suppose you execute some series of transactions to draw your
immediate-mode GUI on the screen.  Each transaction updates some
region of pixels on the screen, having read some set of reactive
variables (the window size, the text buffer contents, the clock, etc.)
and executed some deterministic computation driven by them.</p>
<p>Can we use this to improve the efficiency of immediate-mode GUIs in
the case where the entire screen is not actually changing?  It’s not
super straightforward, but I think so.  If your <code>start_button_height</code>
is tracked by something like Meteor, you can automatically rerun the
draw-button transaction; and if it fails to overwrite pixels that it
was previously overwriting, you can rerun the transactions that
generated those pixels in order to get them back.  (Or maybe you could
retain the pixels in a backing store.)</p>
<p>If you’re doing alpha compositing, of course, you may have to redraw
the background pixels you’re blending the button with first.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
