(5 minutes)</div>
<p>In the last year or so, without quite knowing what I was doing, I’ve
been constructing a series of “studies in simplicity”.  I’ve been
inspired by apostles of simplicity such as Niklaus Wirth and Chuck
Moore; by friends from whom I’ve learned a lot such as Dave Long,
Darius Bacon, Norm Hardy, and Aristotle Pagaltzis; and by current
projects such as VPRI’s “Reinvention of Computing” effort and the
“NAND to Tetris” or <a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/">“The Elements of Computing Systems”</a> course.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this to construct working, useful systems with small
amounts of code, with the functionality of the aspects of computers
that used to scare me, or seem magical, or seem impossible to
understand.  For a long time, I’ve known that there aren’t <em>really</em>
magic elves in the computer, but I’ve always felt pretty uncomfortable
with the handwaving I have to do to explain how, say, a compiler
works.</p>
<p>Part of my objective has been to enable other people to share my
newfound fearlessness.  I haven’t gotten much feedback, so I can only
assume I haven't succeeded in that yet.</p>
<p>To a great extent, this stuff is nothing special; I think it’s stuff
that any computer science undergraduate does, or should do, in a
compilers or operating-systems class, and indeed the “TECS” course
covers most of it in a single semester.</p>
<h2>Tinylisp (2007-09)</h2>
<h2>Tokthr (2007-11)</h2>
<p><em>An interactive Forth interpreter under 2kiB; 1000 lines of code;
unfinished</em>.</p>
<p>One of the first things I tried was implementing a tiny token-threaded
interactive Forth system.  I worked on this for about a week, in
November 2007.  It’s not quite complete, and it’s 1534 bytes in size
when compiled, from about 1000 lines of assembly.</p>
<p>The primary objective is to see if it’s possible to build a usable
interactive development environment in two kilobytes or so, so that
software development doesn’t have to be limited to the wealthy and the
fortunate.  I’m pretty confident that this shows that it’s possible,
at least for people who like Forth.  Here’s my basic rationale, quoted
from the source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are still a lot of computers out there that have tens of
kilobytes of memory or less, and they cost a lot less than,
say, a cellphone.  Cellphones are apparently still too
expensive for half the world’s population.  I want to see how
close I can get to having a comfortable programming
environment in a smaller device.</p>
<p>Some smallish microcontroller chips from five different
manufacturers, with current Digi-Key prices:
<table>
<tr><th>Name              <th>bytes RAM  <th>bytes ROM  <th>MHz  <th>price
<tr><td>ATtiny2313        <td>128        <td>2048       <td>20   <td>US$1.38
<tr><td>ATMega48-20AU     <td>512        <td>4096       <td>20   <td>US$1.62
<tr><td>MSP430F1111AIPW   <td>128        <td>2264       <td>8    <td>US$2.43
<tr><td>LPC2101           <td>2048       <td>8192       <td>70   <td>US$2.52
<tr><td>H8/300H Tiny      <td>1536       <td>8192       <td>12   <td>US$3.58
<tr><td>M16C/R8C/Tiny/1B  <td>1024       <td>16384      <td>12   <td>US$3.54
<tr><td>SX28AC/SS         <td>136        <td>3072       <td>50   <td>US$2.79
</table></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a sense it’s a fairly slow interpreter; it needs about 100ns per
bytecode on my 700MHz laptop, about 70 clock cycles per bytecode.
That’s about as slow as Python 2.4’s bytecode interpreter, but the
bytecodes are much lower-level, so it’s actually slower than Python.</p>
<p>If I (or somebody else) should finish Tokthr, it will be one of the
smallest Forths, and indeed the smallest interactive interpreters,
ever created; it should provide an interactive development environment
in under 2kiB of program with a few hundred bytes of RAM.</p>
<p>Tokthr draws on, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My <a href="http://considerate.murch-sitaker.org/~kragen/electronics/">cheap electronics dissection project</a>, where I
  found out that you could buy a variety of electronic devices for
  under US$10, some with enough space and computational power to be
  usefully programmable, but none that were actually programmable
  (2006);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Richard W. M. Jones’ <a href="http://annexia.org/forth">JONESFORTH</a>, a
  Forth implementation in x86 assembly language (2007);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C. H. Ting and Bill Muench’s public-domain eForth Model 1.0, which
  shows that you can build a practical Forth in very little space and
  very little code (1992?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The inspiration of Chuck Moore, obviously, and Jeff Fox’s
  evangelical and sometimes slightly unhinged zeal in telling the rest
  of us what Chuck had achieved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/urscheme/">Ur-Scheme</a> (2008-02)</h2>
<p><em>Compiler from a subset of Scheme to x86 assembly, written in itself;
1600 lines of code; finished</em>.</p>
<p>This was my first real compiler.  It compiles a subset of R5RS Scheme
big enough to write a compiler in, which I know because I wrote it in
that subset.</p>
<p>Although it takes a very naïve approach to code generation, the code
it produces runs surprisingly fast, only about a factor of 5 slower
than C compiled with GCC.  In part this is due to its omission of
first-class continuations and garbage collection.</p>
<p>It does implement closures, and the assembly it generates compiles to
statically-linked, standalone executables.</p>
<p>Ur-Scheme draws on many inspirations, which are listed on its home
page.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/pricing.html">Pricing</a> (89 notes)
