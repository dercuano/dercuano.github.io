(27 minutes)</div><p>If you infer parametric types for variables used to index arrays (and
then for functions that have them as arguments, and functions that
call them, and so on), I think you can substantially simplify code
that deals with arrays by defining new arrays in terms of pointwise
transforms of old ones, and additionally reduce the distinction
between functions and arrays.  If this information is available
reflectively at run-time, you can get some additional power.</p>
<p>Although the idea looks like it might be a bit clumsier than I was
thinking at first, I still think it may have some merit.</p>
<p>(Further development of the idea is in <a href="../notes/principled-apl.html">A principled rethinking of array languages like APL</a>, from
2015 to 2018.)</p>
<h2>Major Problems</h2>
<p>I think this needs static domain (i.e. dependent type) inference to
work at all (see in the “Efficiency” section) but maybe it’s an
interesting idea anyway.</p>
<p>I sort of took for granted that you would want C-style curried arrays,
where if you have a two-dimensional array a[i][j] you can meaningfully
say a[i] and get an array b[j].  But this seems to have led to some
extra complexity in the definition of asymmetric-union, in the kinds
of domain inference that can plausibly be done in different
situations, and even in the notation to define a two-dimensional
matrix “narrowed” from some underlying function.</p>
<h2>Backus’s Matrix Multiply Program</h2>
<p>So I’ve been reading John Backus’s 1977 Turing Award lecture paper.
(See <a href="../notes/backus-rebuttal.html">Why John Backus Was on the Wrong Track</a> for more commentary.)
In it, among other things, he gives this definition in his FP language
for matrix multiplication:</p>
<pre><code>Def MM = (alpha alpha IP) o (alpha distl) o distr o [1, trans o 2]
</code></pre>
<p>where (less rigorously than in the paper)</p>
<pre><code>: represents function application
&lt; &gt; enclose data vectors
(alpha fn):&lt;z[1], z[2], ...z[n]&gt; = &lt;fn:z[1], fn:z[2], ...z[n]&gt;
(f1 o f2):z = f1:(f2:z)
1:&lt;z[1], z[2], ...z[n]&gt; = z[1]
2:&lt;z[1], z[2], ...z[n]&gt; = z[2]
distr:&lt;&lt;z[1], z[2], ...z[n]&gt;, y&gt; = &lt;&lt;z[1], y&gt;, &lt;z[2], y&gt;, ...&lt;z[n], y&gt;&gt;
distl:&lt;y, &lt;z[1], z[2], ...z[n]&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;y, z[1]&gt;, &lt;y, z[2]&gt;, ...&lt;y, z[n]&gt;&gt;
trans:&lt;&lt;z[1][1], z[1][2], ...z[1][n]&gt;,
       &lt;z[2][1], z[2][2], ...z[2][n]&gt;, ...
       &lt;z[m][1], z[m][2], ...z[m][n]&gt;&gt; = 
                                   &lt;&lt;z[1][1], z[2][1], ... z[m][1]&gt;,
                                    &lt;z[1][2], z[2][2], ... z[m][2]&gt;, ...
                                    &lt;z[1][n], z[2][n], ... z[m][n]&gt;&gt;
x is multiplication
[fn1, fn2, ...fnx]:z = &lt;fn1:z, fn2:z, ... fnx:z&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>IP is his previously given program for the dot product of two
vectors (contained in a vector of two items), which reads as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>Def IP = (/+) o (alpha x) o trans
</code></pre>
<p>where
    /fn:<z[1], z[2], ..., z[n-1], z[n]> = 
                              fn:<z[1], fn:<z[2], ... fn:<z[n-1], z[n]>...&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>If you put it all together and squeeze, you get</p>
<pre><code>Def MM = (a a((/+)o(a x)otrans))o(a distl)o distr o[1,trans o 2]
</code></pre>
<h2>A Simpler Matrix Multiply Program</h2>
<p>So I couldn’t help but think, leaving aside all Backus’s points about
algebraic manipulations of programs and how his unreadable point-free
style is so cool — let’s go to the other extreme!  Wouldn’t it be
easier if you could instead write this?</p>
<pre><code>MM[m][n][i][j] = sum(k) { m[k][j] * n[i][k] }
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you use space for procedure application, and curry in the usual
Haskell/OCaml way:</p>
<pre><code>MM m n i j = sum(k) { m k j * n i k }
</code></pre>
<p>Or in a Lispy syntax, but still assuming that same kind of currying,
so that ((((MM m) n) i) j) is the same as (MM m n i j):</p>
<pre><code>(define (MM m n i j) (sum k (* (m k j) (n i k))))
</code></pre>
<h2>Unifying Arrays With Functions</h2>
<p>I’ve thought for some time that it would be interesting to have a
programming language where arrays and dictionaries are treated as
kinds of functions — they have the distinction that their domains
are finite, but that is the case for many functions.</p>
<p>“sum” in the program above is intended to range its dummy variable
across all possible valid indices.  Evaluating it for some particular
i, j pair requires it to interrogate m for its domain — and, more
interestingly, (n i) for that i.  (What it should do in the case where
the two domains are different, I’m not sure; probably it should signal
an error by default.)</p>
<p>Given that n has some associated thunk that yields its domain for such
purposes, it’s clear to see that the compiler could construct a
similar domain thunk for the result of (MM m n), which would merely
call n’s domain thunk; and for, say, (MM m n 2), given that this
reduces to (lambda (j) (sum k (* m k j) (n 2 k))), it can infer that j
can range over the domain of (m k j) for some k.  (Again, it’s not
clear what to do in the case that the domains are different for
different values of k; if the domain of (MM m n 2) is never requested,
the issue doesn’t arise, but if it is, it might be a good idea to
signal an error by default rather than taking their intersection.)</p>
<h2>Domain Inference as Type Inference</h2>
<p>This “domain inference” is really just a kind of type inference, so it
ought to be possible to do it at compile time.  Maybe we could
statically infer that MM has a type something like</p>
<pre><code>('a:'b -&gt; 'c:'d -&gt; 't) -&gt; ('e:'f -&gt; 'a:'b -&gt; 't) 
    -&gt; 'e:'f -&gt; 'c:'d -&gt; 't
</code></pre>
<p>(I’m assuming here that multiplication has the type ‘t -&gt; ‘t -&gt; ‘t,
i.e. it can only multiply two things of the same type.  There are
other alternatives, but I think that for static inference to work, the
compiler at least has to know whether or not multiplication is going
to yield something a function that has a domain of its own, and if so,
what that range is going to be.)</p>
<p>Doing it statically is a little more trouble than doing it dynamically
because you end up with complicated relationships between
implicitly-universally-quantified variables, like the above, instead
of just some numbers.</p>
<p>Some kinds of control constructs can allow this domain inference to
flow through them as well:</p>
<pre><code>(define (zeroextend vec zero i)
  (cond ((= i (- (domainbegin vec) 1)) zero)
        ((= i (domainend vec)) zero)
        (t (vec i))))
</code></pre>
<p>This is a function which, given a function such as a one-dimensional
vector, and a zero value to extend it with, makes it into a
one-dimensional vector with a domain of indices greater by 1 in each
direction.  I’m using made-up functions “domainbegin” and “domainend”
to return the minimum and maximum+1 values of the domain, which
presumably therefore must consist of a single contiguous sequence of
integers.  This is a useful abstraction to have when, say,
implementing numerical simulations with fixed border conditions.</p>
<p>It seems like making the above conditional transparent to domain
inference would be pretty hard; you could do partial evaluation and
get, say:</p>
<pre><code>(lambda (zero i)
  (cond ((= i -1) zero)
        ((= i 4) zero)
        (t (vec i))))
</code></pre>
<p>at which point you could deduce that the domain of i was the union of
-1:0 (i.e. {-1}), 4:5 ({4}), and 0:4 (the domain of vec), which union
comes out to -1:5.  Is there an easier way, say, one that could be
done at compile time?  Even one that required restructuring
“zeroextend”?  I don’t think macros per se particularly help here.
Maybe you could say:</p>
<pre><code>(define (zeroextend vec zero i)
  (cond ((valid? (vec i)) (vec i))
        ((valid? (vec (+ i 1))) zero)
        ((valid? (vec (- i 1))) zero)
        ; otherwise error:
        (t (vec i))))
</code></pre>
<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>I’m not claiming that you can infer which inputs will lead to an
infinite loop.  That “Total Functional Programming” approach is not
something I’m considering here, although it does kind of look
interesting.</p>
<h2>Narrowing</h2>
<p>To make such a system useful, the programmer needs to be able to
artificially impose boundaries on functions with much larger
underlying domains.  For example, you could define the identity matrix
in the abstract as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(define (identity i j) (if (= i j) 1 0))
</code></pre>
<p>But, if the matrix multiply routine from earlier is going to insist
that its arguments be conformable, you need to be able to wrap it in
something to restrict its domain, like this:</p>
<pre><code>(narrow (domainbegin m) (domainend m) identity)
</code></pre>
<p>or even</p>
<pre><code>(narrow (domainbegin m) (domainend m)
        (lambda (i) (narrow (domainbegin (m i)) (domainend (m i))
                            (identity i))))
</code></pre>
<p>or even (in cases where you already have a function handy with the
desired range)</p>
<pre><code>(narrow m (lambda i (narrow (m i) (identity i))))
</code></pre>
<h2>Inference Rules for Primitives</h2>
<p>So if we want to infer the domain for some parameter, and it’s being
used somewhere deep inside of a context that has some known domain, we
can often solve it.  Here is a non-exhaustive list for cases of
contiguous integer ranges; p is the parameter whose domain we want to
infer, and k is a constant.</p>
<pre><code>(+ p k) as n:m =&gt; p as n-k:m-k
(+ k p) as n:m =&gt; p as n-k:m-k
(- p k) as n:m =&gt; p as n+k:m+k
(- k p) as n:m =&gt; p as k-m+1:k-n+1
(* p k) as n:m =&gt; p as n/k:m/k      for k positive  (how do we adjust this when k/n is noninteger?)
(* p k) as n:m =&gt; p as m/k+1:n/k+1  for k negative  (who cares about the 0 case?)
/, &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt; can be treated as cases of *, I think, although / raises
funny issues about approximate results (which way are they
rounded?)
(&amp; p bitmask) as n:m =&gt; p can be any int if the bitmask ensures that 
                        the result is in n:m; complicated otherwise
(&amp; bitmask p) likewise
(remainder p k) likewise
(min p k) as n:m =&gt; p as n:inf if k &lt; m; complicated otherwise
(max p k) as n:m =&gt; p as -inf:m if k &gt;= n; complicated otherwise
(abs p) as n:m =&gt; p as -m+1:m if n &lt;= 0 and m &gt; 0; complicated otherwise
</code></pre>
<p>My hypothesis here is that these rules don’t have to successfully
analyze every possible program; it just has to be possible to write
programs that they can analyze that do what you want, at least most of
the time.</p>
<h2>Difficulties in Domain Inference</h2>
<p>A parameter that is used exactly once in one of the following ways
poses no difficulties for domain inference:</p>
<ul>
<li>to index a concrete array</li>
<li>to pass to a primitive function with a fixed domain</li>
<li>to pass to some other user-defined function as a parameter with a
  known domain</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters that are passed to certain primitive functions may have
more restricted domains inferred for them; for example, the domain of
(lambda (i) (m (+ i 1)) is the same size as the domain of m, but
offset by 1; and (lambda (i) (m (/ i 2))) is twice the size of the
domain of m.  (And depending on what kind of division that is and
whether m’s range consists only of integers, it might have twice as
many elements.)</p>
<p>Parameters that are not used at all therefore could have any value,
which is a problem, in a way.  Parameters that are used more than once
require deciding what to do in the case of overlapping, but not equal,
domains.  (Maybe there should be a default, and maybe the default
should be to intersect the domains rather than to raise an error.)</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of the restrictions placed by Girard’s “linear
logic” and Henry Baker’s “Linear Lisp”, in which each variable must be
used exactly once in a particular path of execution.  In this case,
some paths of execution (those that depend on the value of the
variable itself) may not count, but that’s perhaps a detail.</p>
<p>Perhaps the solution, then, is to require or allow explicit
duplication of parameters that are used for things with more than one
domain, specifying how to resolve differences between the two.  For
example, you could define a “deltas” function as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(define (deltas vec i)
  (- (vec (+ i 1)) (vec (intersecting i))))
</code></pre>
<p>to specify that the domain inferred for the second “i” is to be
intersected with the other inferred domain, rather than raising an
error.  (I’m not sure that this shouldn’t be the default.)</p>
<h2>Domain Inference In Conditionals</h2>
<p>So if we have (if cond result alt), what do we do?</p>
<p>If the cond tests a parameter we’re trying to infer information about,
we may be able to infer something about the values that parameter can
take in the branch taken.  If we have (if (&lt; i 2) (foo i) (bar i)),
then we know that in the i&lt;2 case, we’re interested in foo’s domain,
and in the i&gt;=2 case, we’re interested in bar’s domain.  So if foo’s
domain is 0:10 and bar’s is -10:5, the correct domain to infer is 0:5:</p>
<ul>
<li>first we construct -inf:2 and 2:inf domains;</li>
<li>we intersect -inf:2 with 0:10 and get 0:2;</li>
<li>we intersect 2:inf with 0:5 and get 2:5;</li>
<li>we union 0:2 and 2:5 and get 0:5.</li>
</ul>
<p>(This gets tougher if we have ((if (&lt; i 2) foo bar) i).)</p>
<p>Suppose the conditional doesn’t test the parameter of interest,
though.  Now the domain is harder to figure out.  Should we intersect
the domains computed for the two branches, as if they both got
executed (a conservative approximation to the domain)?  Should we
complain if the domains computed are different (when in doubt, refuse
the temptation to guess)?  Or should we take the union of those
domains (a liberal approximation)?</p>
<h2>Asymmetric Union</h2>
<p>I recently wrote this C function:</p>
<pre><code>    // returns an approximation of 256 * sqrt(sqr)
    int inline interp_sqrt(int sqr) {
      if (sqr &lt; max_sqrtx256) return sqrtx256[sqr] &gt;&gt; 4;
      int high = sqr &gt;&gt; 8; // we hope high &lt; max_sqrtx256-1
      int below = sqrtx256[high];
      int above = sqrtx256[high+1];
      int spread = above - below;
      int correction = ((sqr &amp; 0xff) * spread) &gt;&gt; 8;
      return correction + below;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The table sqrtx256[ii] contains (int)(0.5 + 256 * 16 * sqrt(ii)) for
values of ii up to max_sqrtx256; that’s the rounded value of 
256 * sqrt(ii * 256), or sqrt(ii &lt;&lt; 8) &lt;&lt; 8.  For largish values of
sqr, it linearly interpolates sqrt(sqr) between two adjacent values
from that table, but I found that was too inaccurate for small values
of sqr, so I used the table directly for them.  (sqrt(ii * 256) is 
16 * sqrt(ii).)</p>
<p>(This is all integer math because floating-point is absurdly slow on
my CPU.)</p>
<p>So to look at it another way, I constructed two approximations of
sqrt:</p>
<pre><code>(define (approx1 sqr) (&gt;&gt; (sqrtx256 sqr) 4))
(define (approx2 sqr)
  (let* ((high (&gt;&gt; sqr 8))
         (below (sqrtx256 high))
         (above (sqrtx256 (+ (intersecting high) 1)))
         (spread (- above below))
         (correction (&gt;&gt; (* (&amp; (intersecting sqr) 0xff) spread) 8)))
    (+ correction below)))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if sqrtx256 has a known domain, it should be straightforward to
infer the domains for approx1 and approx2, given appropriate rules for
(&gt;&gt; x constant) and (+ x constant).  (In my case, it happened that
approx1’s domain was a subset of approx2’s.)  So it would be nice to
construct a combined function that used approx1 for arguments within
its range, and approx2 when they were outside of approx1’s range but
within approx2’s — a sort of asymmetric union — </p>
<pre><code>(define interp_sqrt (asymmetric-union approx1 approx2 
                                      (lambda (x) (* (sqrt x) 256))))
</code></pre>
<p>You can define asymmetric-union, for two functions and a single
argument, as follows, in terms of the valid? predicate from the
earlier “zeroextend” function:</p>
<pre><code>(define (asymmetric-union x y i) (if (valid? (x i)) (x i) (y i)))
</code></pre>
<p>I’m not sure to what extent you can write an asymmetric-union that
works for an arbitrary number of arguments.</p>
<h2>Space-Time Tradeoffs as Annotation</h2>
<p>In general it’s desirable when you can have the actual code to solve a
problem in one place, while the optimizations that make it possible to
execute the code with adequate speed are somewhere else.  SQL
databases are probably the most-widely-known example of this; indices
make it possible to execute queries at a reasonable speed, but most
SQL statements are guaranteed to return the same results regardless of
what indices exist, at least if they ever finish.  (The ability to
replace a table with a view, and then possibly materialize that view,
is a more extreme example of the same thing.)</p>
<p>Any kind of separation of interface and implementation gives you this
ability to some extent, in the sense that the code that calls the
interface will only run fast if the implementation (which is somewhere
else) is adequately efficient.  But it is often the case that our
implementations mix together their essential semantics with
efficiency-driven choices of representation and so on, which makes it
difficult to determine whether the code is actually correct.</p>
<p>Another common way to separate the optimizations from the semantics is
to put the optimizations in the compiler, or even in the CPU.  While
this is very economically efficient — it allows all programs
compiled by the compiler or run on the CPU to get the benefit — it
has a certain incentive problem, namely that the guy who thinks his
code runs too slowly usually isn’t in a position to modify the
compiler or the CPU to speed it up.</p>
<p>So recently I was computing, in Numerical Python, a bunch of animation
frames of expanding haloes for <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/pygmusic">a game-like program I was writing</a>.  (I
say “game-like” because it doesn’t have a score or a goal; it’s a
simple sound sample sequencer.)  The NumPy code that renders a frame
looks more or less like this, although I’m leaving out the stuff that
computes the RGBA palette (indexed by ‘take’ in the last line),
interacts with SDL, and handles varying object lifetimes.</p>
<pre><code>    # inputs are size, max_age, fuzz, age
    shape = (size*2, size*2)
    cx = cy = size                  # x and y at center
    xs, ys = Numeric.indices(shape) # x and y coords of each pixel
    (dx, dy) = (xs - cx, ys - cy)   # distances from center for each pixel
    rsq = dx*dx + dy*dy        # squared distance from center

    max_level = size**2/2 * (1 - (1 - age*2)**2)
    density = Numeric.clip(Numeric.absolute(rsq - max_level),
                           0, fuzz**2).astype(Numeric.Int)
    colors = Numeric.take(palette, density)
</code></pre>
<p>Originally I was computing each frame like this on the fly, but I was
taking a hit on my frame rate.  So I made an object that stored up
everything except age, max_level, density, colors, and palette, which
involved quite a bit of change to the above code.  That worked OK but
was still slow, so I precomputed 48 frames the first time any of them
was requested, which took a second or two, and then just fetched the
precomputed frames from then on.</p>
<p>That was fine, but then I used a larger halo somewhere else and the
pause when it was computed was rather dramatic.  So I changed the
strategy again to compute, then store, each frame as it was asked for;
this improved the situation to a slightly perceptible slowdown the
first few times the larger halo was used (since only a few of the
frames would be requested each time), but introduced a couple of
visible levels of indirection into the code.  Now the NumericHaloMovie
object has a <code>__getitem__</code> that renders frames on KeyError, and there’s
a get_halo_movie function that stores references to the existing
NumericHaloMovies and creates new ones when needed.  This extra code
complicates the task of someone who wants to see where the images are
coming from.</p>
<p>In a system where the contents of arrays, the contents of
dictionaries, and the return values of functions are defined the same
way and accessed the same way, the decision about whether and how a
particular function is memoized would not need to be part of that
function’s actual code.  You could simply say somewhere:</p>
<pre><code>(declare-concrete rsq density colors)
</code></pre>
<p>to tell the system to eagerly materialize those functions as concrete
arrays.  And possibly</p>
<pre><code>(memoize frames)
</code></pre>
<p>to tell the system to materialize items of frames when they are
needed, but then remember them.  (Maybe.  It will require some
cleverness to actually make that possible.)</p>
<p>(Of course, now that I write this, I think maybe I should have just
written a DictionaryMemoizer and ArrayMemoizer in Python, which, in a
way, is just the approach of merely separating interface from
implementation.  Oh well.  Maybe I will.)</p>
<h2>My Halo Animation Expressed This Way</h2>
<p>Compare to Python code earlier.</p>
<pre><code>(define (sq x) (* x x))
(define (colors palette size max_age fuzz age x y)
  (let* ((rsq (let ((dx (- x size)) (dy (- y size)))
                (+ (sq dx) (sq dy))))
         (max_level (* (/ (sq size) 2) (- 1 (sq (- 1 (* age 2))))))
         (density
          (int (clip 0 (sq fuzz) (abs (- rsq max_level))))))
    (palette density)))
(define (discrete-colors palette size max_age fuzz age)
  (narrow-to-int-range 0 (* 2 size) 
    (lambda (x)
      (narrow-to-int-range 0 (* 2 size)
                           (colors palette size max_age fuzz age x)))))
; already defined in Numeric, but here it is:
(define (clip min max val) 
  (cond ((&lt; val min) min) ((&gt; val max) max) (t val)))
</code></pre>
<p>The Python code is clearer, I think.  Infix syntax helps for numerical
things!  Also, the two-layer-deep narrow-to-int-range thing is a mess.</p>
<p>However, this looks a lot like what I would write in C, and
consequently isn’t all that novel; none of the variables (other than
discrete-colors) have what you’d think of as a matrix value.</p>
<p>I tried writing a version in which the variables x and y were passed
explicitly to each thing that needed them, making it clear that, say,
rsq and density varied by pixel, while max_level and palette didn’t.
So they were arrays, in a sense.  But it was far more wordy than this
version.</p>
<h2>Windows and Sprites</h2>
<p>Asymmetric union is exactly what you need for drawing windows on the
screen: consider the window to be a function from coordinates to pixel
values that is only defined at some pixels.  If your system
additionally supports domains that are more complicated than simple
contiguous ranges of integers, you get the ability to composite
sprites and shaped windows.</p>
<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>Of course if you’re checking (dynamically or statically) that the
parameters you’re passing to a function are inside a domain where that
function won’t violate any array bounds, you can leave off checking
for that inside the function.  This subsumes a lot of the kind of type
checking needed for safety and dynamic dispatch as well.</p>
<p>So suppose you use the dynamic strategy I suggested with the matrix
multiply program I had at the beginning:</p>
<pre><code>(define (MM m n i j) (sum k (* (m i k) (n k j))))
</code></pre>
<p>When you are evaluating, say, (MM m n 3 4), you check upon entry to MM
that 3 is within the relevant domain, given m and n.  Then, in the
inner loop, you don’t need to do much bounds checking:</p>
<ul>
<li>you know 3 is within the domain of m, because that’s where the range
  of (MM m n) came from;</li>
<li>you know k is within the domains of (m 3) and n, because that’s
  where its values came from.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you still need to verify that (n k j) is valid, each time
through the loop, because in the dynamic approach, you don’t know if
each of the (n k) is a different length.  I think that this is a
serious problem because it means you can’t actually find out what the
domain of (MM m n 3) is at all.</p>
<p>If you are calling MM from inside some larger loop, you may be able to
push the bounds-checking of i and j out even further, using the same
approach.  For example, if for some reason you were to write</p>
<pre><code>(sum i (sum j (MM m n i j)))
</code></pre>
<p>then, each time through the inner loop, you would know that i and j
were within the bounds of (MM m n) because that’s where the sum
operators are getting them, so you wouldn’t need to do any
bounds-checking inside at all.</p>
