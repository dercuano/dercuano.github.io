<p>Okay, so, if you write your program purely in terms of pure functions,
you can memoize those functions, perhaps applying a global caching
policy to their results to optimize throughput or limit expected
latency.  I've written about this a bit before.</p>
<p>You can do a bit better than pure functions: you can run arbitrary
code with read-only access to the entire program state, as long as its
access to that state is mediated by a sort of
software-transactional-memory layer that records everything it reads.
Then you can automatically invalidate the cached result whenever any
of the state variables that fed into it are changed or invalidated.</p>
<p>I was thinking about trying to apply this paradigm to a smallish
program this weekend, one which redraws the screen frequently.  I'd
like it to just redraw the relevant part of the screen.  At the
moment, I'm sending text and escape sequences to a tty, but more or
less the same principles apply if you're updating a framebugger.</p>
<p>The program displays a spreadsheet-like table with editable text in
the cells.  Sometimes it updates the layout.</p>
<p>But most keystroke events result in a single letter being added to the
screen, overwriting a blank space, or a single letter being replaced
with a blank space; many others result in highlighting one cell of the
table and unhighlighting another.</p>
<p>There are perhaps 100 characters per line and perhaps 20 lines on the
screen, for about 2000 characters in total.  The simplest way to make
the program work is to redraw the whole screen after every keystroke,
which does run acceptably fast on modern hardware.  But this does
something like 2000 times as much work as necessary: 22 Moore's Law
years, taking us back to about 1980.  It would be nice to find an
approach to only redraw the changed part of the screen, not even the
entire line.</p>
<p>Now, if you're only looking at the bytes coming out of the program,
you can achieve this by redrawing an in-memory screen image, comparing
it to the previous screen image, encoding the delta in bytes, and
sending that to the tty.  But that doesn't really touch the
orders-of-magnitude issue.</p>
<h2>Variable per character</h2>
<p>You could have a couple of transactional-memory variables for each
character position on the screen, and <em>monitor</em> a function for each of
those characters.  To update the screen, you'd see which characters
had changed, and iterate over them sending them to the screen.  This
has presumably order-of-magnitude overheads, but it ought to be
scalable.</p>
<p>What does the function for a character look like?  Something like</p>
<pre><code>char_to_show(x, y) = (highlight if is_current(cell_obj) else normal)(char)
where:
    cell_obj, label_index = table_cell_covering(x, y)
    label = label_of(cell_obj)
    char = label[label_index] if label_index &lt; length(label) else ' '
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these functions could reasonably be cached, but
<code>table_cell_covering</code> is kind of a bear, because it depends on the
current layout, which depends ultimately on the contents of every
cell that isn't to the right:</p>
<pre><code>table_cell_covering(x, y) = cells[col][y], dx
where:
    col = find_col(x, 0)
    dx = x - col_start(col)

find_col(x, col) = col if found_col else find_col(x, col+1)
where:
    found_col = (col == n_cols - 1 or col_start(col+1) &gt; x)

col_start(col) = 0 if col == 0 else col_start(col-1) + col_width(col-1)
col_width(col) = col_width(col, n_rows)
col_width(col, row) = 0 if row == 0 else max(col_width(col, row-1), w)
where:
    w = length(label_of(cells[col][row-1]))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>col_start</code> can clearly be cached usefully: it has a small number
of distinct argument values, and it depends ultimately only on the
lengths of the labels of the columns of <code>cells</code> to the left of the
requested position.  You could alternatively cache <code>col_width</code>.</p>
<p>But that means that if you change the label of, say, the bottom left
cell, the <code>col_start</code> values of every cell in the matrix needs to be
revalidated --- just in case you changed the width of the first
column.  Usually you won't have, but if you did, the whole screen
might need to be updated.  You'd have to redo the <code>col_start</code>
computation to see that it hadn't changed, and then, if you'd
propagated an "invalidated" notification downstream to the <code>find_col</code>,
<code>table_cell_covering</code>, and <code>char_to_show</code> computations, follow it up
with a "revalidated" notification.</p>
<p>But that means you're delivering thousands of "revalidated"
notifications, which is basically what you were trying to avoid in the
first place.</p>
<p>How could you avoid this?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eagerness: instead of merely invalidating <code>col_width(col, row)</code>
when you change <code>cells[col][row-1]</code>, necessarily propagating the
invalidation to <code>col_width(col)</code>, <code>col_start(col+1)</code>, and so on, you
could simply re-evaluate <code>col_width(col, row)</code> immediately, probably
coming up with the same value again and avoiding pushing the change
further downstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An idea that doesn't work: Deep validation checking: instead of
propagating the invalidation flag to thousands of character positions,
so that the operation of cache validation for <code>char_to_show(x, y)</code> is
O(1), you could make the is-valid check on the character position dig
into the dependencies and dependencies of dependencies of the
character position, so that whenever you run the is-valid check on any
of the changed character positions, it notices whether a relevant
cached <code>col_start</code> value has changed.  This doesn't work because it
presupposes that you're iterating over all the thousands of character
positions in order to figure out that you need to update only one
character position on the screen, which is what I was trying to avoid
in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregation: Instead of making each of the 2000 or so character
positions a tracked variable, divide the screen into about sqrt(2000)
regions: say, half a line each, which should give you about 40
variables.  Then your initial invalidation notification ends up
affecting, say, half the screen, but that's only about 20 invalidation
notifications; and then you can iterate over those 20 chunks of
visible text and figure out that 19 of them are still up-to-date, and
the other one has changed, and redisplay its 50 characters.  This
means that you're doing about 100 things (including redisplaying 50
characters) instead of 2000, but that's still a long way from 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Side-effecting transactions: I don't think they'll work</h2>
<p>In transactional memories used for concurrency control, your
transaction code can choose any arbitrary variable in the STM to write
to.  Your writes are buffered, and if your transaction successfully
commits, they become visible to later transactions, and if there are
currently running concurrent transactions that have read the modified
state variables, those other transactions are aborted.</p>
<p>By contrast, I've been proposing a purely-functional computational
model here.  The problem is that it's fairly absurd to think of going
through a computation like this:</p>
<pre><code>char_to_show(x, y) = (highlight if is_current(cell_obj) else normal)(char)
where:
    cell_obj, label_index = table_cell_covering(x, y)
    label = label_of(cell_obj)
    char = label[label_index] if label_index &lt; length(label) else ' '

table_cell_covering(x, y) = cells[col][y], dx
where:
    col = find_col(x, 0)
    dx = x - col_start(col)

find_col(x, col) = col if found_col else find_col(x, col+1)
where:
    found_col = (col == n_cols - 1 or col_start(col+1) &gt; x)
</code></pre>
<p>in order to figure out what to draw in a <em>single character position in
a terminal</em>, even if <code>is_current</code>, <code>label_of</code>, and <code>col_start</code> are all
fully cached.  (If you extrapolate this example to pixels, the problem
is even worse.)</p>
<p>Consider, by contrast, this imperative push-based code:</p>
<pre><code>show_cell(row, col) =
    cell = cells[col][row]
    label = label_of(cell)
    x = col_start[col]
    width = col_width[col]
    start = row * screen_width + x
    len = length(label)
    memcpy(&amp;screenbuf[start], charptr(label), len)
    memset(&amp;screenbuf[start + len], ' ', width - len)
    color = (highlight if is_current(cell) else normal)
    memset(&amp;attrbuf[start], color, width)
</code></pre>
<p>This is doing about the same amount of work as the pull-based code
above, but it's displaying the entire cell, not just a single
character!</p>
<p>The basic problem here is that each cell of the table only affects a
small number of character positions on the display.  It's reminiscent
of the problem with the functional stream-based "unfaithful Sieve of
Eratosthenes" that Melissa O'Neill identified in her paper, <em>The
Genuine Sieve of Eratosthenes</em>; where she says:</p>
<pre><code>In Eratosthenes’s algorithm, we start crossing off multiples of 17
at 289 (i.e., 17× 17) and cross off the multiples 289, 306, 323,
. . . , 510, 527, making fifteen crossings off in total. .  . .

After finding that 17 is prime, the unfaithful sieve will check
all the numbers not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 or 13 for
divisibility by 17. It will perform this test on a total of
ninety-nine numbers (19, 23, 29, 31, . . . , 523, 527).
</code></pre>
<p>Analogously, to figure out what to draw at the character position (60,
4), my side-effect-free table-drawing code must ask whether column 60
is in table column 0, then whether it's in table column 1, and so on,
until it finds the correct column; and then it must do the same
computation again for column 61, and column 62, and so on.  By
contrast, the imperative algorithm can do the analogous computation
with a simple array lookup, and then it can handle the entire string
contents of the label with a simple <code>memcpy</code>, which processes several
bytes per cycle.</p>
<p>So it would be nice to make this work.  But I don't think it will,
because of the invalidation problem inherent in imperative overwrites.</p>
<p>STM dependency tracking works because you don't need to know what
other variables a transaction could conceivably have read or written,
had it found different values in the variables it did read; if need
be, you can abort and restart the transaction with the new variable
values, and record its new behavior.</p>
<p>In this case, though, we're interested not only in the variables that
the transaction <em>did</em> write to, but the variables it <em>could have</em>
written to.  In this case, for example, we'd like to know what screen
positions our cell could have written to if the layout had been
different: either the cell itself was wider, overwriting positions to
its right, or the cells to its left were narrower, so it overwrote
positions to its left.</p>
<p>This is an insoluble problem as long as the code running inside the
transaction is written in a Turing-complete language.  You could maybe
do it if it's expressed in something more restrictive and
"declarative", but this is enough to make me give up on this line of
inquiry.</p>
<h2>Composing the screen image from cacheable pieces</h2>
<p>The problem with the above approaches is that you have lots of
branching out in the dataflow graph: ultimately, the contents of every
cell at least potentially affects the contents of every character
position on the screen that isn't to its left.</p>
<p>What if we go the other way instead?  Instead of branching out, we
branch in: many table cells get turned into cacheable chunks of
screen, which are composed into a screen image.</p>
<p>At first glance, this seems to be a non-solution: what do you do with
the screen image?  It's 2000 characters.  Do you want to iterate over
all of them?</p>
<p>Consider how you'd implement the <code>label_of()</code> function described above
in a language like C, without thinking about caching, in particular
for a cell whose label is really an integer, not simply a string; or
maybe it's in a format like "t &gt;&gt; 6", where the 6 is an integer that
can vary over time.  You'd like to be able to cache the results.</p>
<p>You could dynamically allocate a string buffer, serialize the number
into it (expanding it if necessary), and return the new string,
attempting to communicate to the caller that they were responsible for
deallocating it when they were done with it.  (Maybe if your program
was too efficient, you'd use reference counting.)  But that's sort of
wasteful; in the end, the string contents are going to get copied into
some kind of screen image or something.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of the above method is that the cell can produce an
arbitrarily long label, which means you need dynamic allocation, at
least in principle.  This is sort of silly if you're generating a
label to fill a fixed-size space on the screen.  You could use the
interface provided by the <code>read</code> system call: when you call <code>read</code>,
beyond telling it which file you want to read, you pass it a buffer
pointer and a maximum length, and it writes your result into that
buffer.  Then you could pass the render-cell functions pointers to the
relevant parts of your screen buffer.</p>
<p>For more flexibility, you could provide an "output" callback, which
can be called, maybe more than once, to add characters to the label.
This approach subsumes the previous two, since your output callback
could simply add to a string buffer, but it could instead update a
screen image.  For caching purposes, we can consider the image
produced by calls to the output callback to be the "return value" of
your cell rendering function.</p>
<p>So suppose this is the interface we use for the things that generate
parts of the screen contents: we pass in a "window" object to draw
into, and we consider its dimensions part of the arguments for the
sake of caching; it has a "subwindow" method that can be used to
generate a smaller window to pass to subfunctions.  Then we can do
things this way:</p>
<pre><code>image_of_table(win) = image_of_columns(win, n_cols)
image_of_columns(win, col) =
    if col &gt; 0:
        start = col_start(col)
        image_of_columns(win.subwindow(width=start, col-1), col-1)
        image_of_column(win.subwindow(left=start, width=col_width(col)), col-1)
image_of_column(win, col) =
    if win.height &gt; 0:
        image_of_column(win.subwindow(height=win.height-1), col)
        image_of_cell(win.subwindow(top=win.height-1), col, win.height-1)
image_of_cell(win, col, row) =
    color = highlight if is_current(cell) else normal
    win.show(label_of(cells[col][row]), color)
col_start(col) = 0 if col == 0 else col_start(col-1) + col_width(col-1)
col_width(col) = col_width(col, n_rows)
col_width(col, row) = 0 if row == 0 else max(col_width(col, row-1), w)
where:
    w = length(label_of(cells[col][row-1]))
</code></pre>
<p>(The imperative syntax here is fairly grating.  It would probably be
clearer to write these as expressions of some kind.)</p>
<p>Here, if you update the label of the upper-left-hand cell, it will
initially invalidate <code>col_width</code> of the first column, the image of
that cell, the image of its column, and the images of every set of
columns; but it will not immediately invalidate the images of each
other column, nor the other cells in the same column.  If the
newly-recomputed <code>col_width</code> is the same, the images of the other
cells in the column will also not need to be recomputed; and so the
only call to <code>win.show</code> will be for that single cell.  The other cells
and columns will be composited into the screen image in the same place
they were before, which amounts to no change.</p>
<p>If you update a cell further down and to the right, the block of
columns to its left remains cacheable, as do the block of cells above
it — again, assuming they aren't invalidated by a changed <code>col_width</code>.
In cases like this, you can reduce the number of invalidations by
dividing screen regions up in a binary fashion rather than linearly:</p>
<pre><code>image_of_column(win, first_row, col) =
    if win.height &gt; 1:
        mid = win.height div 2
        image_of_column(win.subwindow(height=mid), first_row, col)
        image_of_column(win.subwindow(top=mid), first_row + mid, col)
    elif win.height == 1:
        image_of_cell(win, col, first_row)
</code></pre>
<p>(This strategy should be abstractable into higher-order functions for
vertical and horizontal stacks.)</p>
<p>If the implementation of <code>show</code> actually stores its arguments into
such a screen image, the updates to the screen image can be done
without any heap allocation.  However, if you're running a unified
caching layer, you need to maintain the metadata that says which
screen regions were produced by calling which functions with which
arguments; in this case, there are about two or three such cache
metadata nodes per cell that was displayed.  I estimate that each such
node is around 12 words, 48 bytes on a 32-bit machine, and the number
of cells involved might be 100 — so 4800 bytes, less than three times
the size of the screen in question.  (And that's if you don't discard
any of the nodes.)  I'm not sure if there's a reasonable way to manage
that metadata without dynamic allocation.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that our screen image isn't just a flat array of bytes
(or two of them), but instead, a replicated object that produces a
data stream of the updates made to it to an interested observer.  When
a call to <code>win.show</code> is made, or if the cache copies data from one
place in the screen image to another, the observer is informed.</p>
<p>Such an observer is just what you need to produce a stream of updates
to send to a terminal emulator.</p>
<h2>Generalizing and simplifying the screen-image example</h2>
<p>So what do we have here?  We seem to have constructed a sort of
special-purpose cache manager for a certain kind of object,
rectangular regions of a terminal screen.  Was this necessary?  How
big is the benefit?  And how many special-purpose cache managers will
we want to make over time?</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
