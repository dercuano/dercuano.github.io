(3 minutes)</div><p>Suppose that you wanted to preserve some textual library and ensure
that it remained available.  Perhaps you could ensure that by enticing
people to comment and contribute, but requiring them to publicly
self-host a replica in order to do so.</p>
<p>In particular, you could do this by requiring them to comment by
adding the comment in their own local fork of the library and sending
a pull request.  They could self-host privately, or read without
commenting, and remain private; but in order to comment, they would
need to host a copy themselves and keep it online long enough for the
author to pull from it.</p>
<p>This would ensure that many copies of this library would exist.</p>
<p>Ideally, downloading a replica of the library wouldn’t take any more
bandwidth than downloading a regular web page.  But how much is that?</p>

<p>Watching a high-resolution YouTube video can easily use 12 megabytes
per minute.</p>
<p>So a median web page now is about 2MB of data in the initial load, and
another several megs per minute.  So it probably isn’t useful any more
to keep the initial load below, say, ¼MB, and you can probably use 16
to 64 megs of data transfer to do the whole replication if the user
doesn’t have to wait for all of that, but you probably don’t want to
cost them 128 or 256 megs.  I say this even though finding all of the
above sites frustratingly slow, except for Hacker News, because
apparently people use them anyway.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters">Chris Zacharias’s famous “Page Weight
Matters”</a> tells
about how he made YouTube much more useful in 2009 by reducing the
Youtube watch page’s weight from 1.2MB to 98kB, enabling its use in
areas in Siberia and Southeast Asia where 98kB still took two minutes
to load.  I think that probably in 2015 the number has gotten
substantially higher.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
