<p>There's a flowchart of copyright in the UK at
<a href="http://www.museumscopyright.org.uk/private.pdf">http://www.museumscopyright.org.uk/private.pdf</a>.  The applicable path
goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the author known? Yes.<br />
Is the work a literary, dramatic or musical work, a photograph or an
    engraving, created before 1 August 1989? Yes.<br />
Is the work a photograph taken before 1 June 1957? No.<br />
Was the work published before 1 August 1989? Yes.<br />
Did the author die more than 20 years before publication? If yes, then
    copyright expires 50 years after first publication; if no, copyright
    expires 70 years after the death of the author.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_Kingdom">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_Kingdom</a> says:</p>
<pre><code>Prior to 1 January 1996, the UK's general copyright term was life
of the author plus 50 years. The extension to life of the author
plus 70 years was introduced by The Duration of Copyright and
Rights in Performances Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/3297); which had
the effect of making EU Council Directive No. 93/98/EEC, created
to harmonise the duration of copyright across the European
Economic Area, law in the UK.

<p>The 1911 copyright act of the UK was the relevant act at the time; I
haven't been able to find a copy of it yet.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/history.html">History</a> (71 notes)
