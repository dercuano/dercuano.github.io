(12 minutes)</div><p>We can do a lot more automated testing now than we could before, but
manual testing still requires the same amount of human effort.  To
some extent our new powers of automated testing are counterbalanced by
our new ability to write inefficient software, but not in all cases.</p>
<p>When we have a program, we can run it many times on different inputs
to see what it does.  “Hypothesis” is David R. MacIver’s Python system for
doing this automatically (“generative testing” or “property-based
testing”), and it has been remarkably effective in my experience in
flushing out hidden bugs in programs — including, unfortunately, the
Python interpreter!</p>
<p>The number of test cases we can run scales inversely with the amount
of work done by each test.  Consider this function:</p>
<pre><code>void
yp_font_show(yp_font *font, char *text, ypic where)
{
  int x = 0, y = 0;
  for (int i = 0; text[i]; i++) {
    ypic g = yp_font_glyph(font, text[i]);
    if (x + g.size.x &gt; where.size.x) {
      x = 0;
      y += font-&gt;max_height;
    }
    if (x + g.size.x &gt; where.size.x) return; /* Glyph is too wide to fit */
    if (y &gt; where.size.y) return;

    yp_copy(yp_sub(where, yp_p(x, y + font-&gt;max_height - g.size.y), g.size), g);
    x += g.size.x;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In a benchmark, this function takes about 36 μs on my laptop to draw
the text “hello, world” in a window in a large font, or 5.7 μs in a
12-pixel-tall font.</p>
<p>One core of my four-core laptop executes about 2.4 billion 64-bit
instructions per second.  A 33-MHz 80386 executed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second">about 4.3 million
32-bit instructions per second</a>; we can extrapolate that it might
have run this function some 560 times slower, perhaps requiring 3.2 ms
for the 12-pixel font instead of 5.7 μs.  So the 386 could test this
function (with similar inputs) 300 times per second, while my
four-core laptop can test it 700’000 times per second.</p>
<h2>Testing hardware: a 40-kW, 100-million-MIPS Pi Beowulf per programmer?</h2>
<p>Moreover, I can potentially take advantage of more than just my laptop
for automated testing.  A Raspberry Pi 2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second">is about 5000 MIPS</a> and
<a href="https://raspi.tv/2018/how-much-power-does-raspberry-pi-3b-use-power-measurements">runs on about 2</a> <a href="https://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/power-consumption">to 2.3 watts</a>.  If I have a 1-kilowatt
testing budget, I can run about 500 Pi 2s and get about 2.5 trillion
instructions per second, testing this function roughly 700 million
times per second.</p>
<p>(This works out to 400–460 pJ per instruction.  The STM32L Cortex-M0
(see files <a href="../notes/low-power-micros.html">Low-power microcontrollers for a low-power computer</a> and <a href="../notes/stm32.html">Notes on the STM32 microcontroller family</a>) uses about a third of that,
but has less memory.)</p>
<p>Is a kilowatt a reasonable budget?  Such a rig also costs about US$20k
up front and has 500 gigabytes of RAM; at 67×56×11.5 mm each, it would
occupy about 21 liters, a box 275 mm on a side, but probably a bit
more space is needed for cooling fans and power supplies.  A kilowatt
costs about US$0.10 per hour, or US$900 per year, which is about a
sixth of the depreciation, depending on how you calculate it.  This
suggests looking for ways to reduce the up-front cost per MIPS even if
they increase power consumption.</p>
<p>If we figure that employing a programmer these days costs about US$300k per
year (including overhead and benefits), the programmer dominates the
expenses until the testing budget gets to 43 kilowatts per programmer,
at which point we’re spending US$600k per year and getting 30 billion
tests of <code>yp_font_show</code> and 108 trillion instructions per second.
This is more than a cubic meter of computer.</p>
<h2>Manual vs. automatic testing cost comparison</h2>
<p>By contrast, I might be able to write JUnit-style regression tests of
this function at a rate of one per minute or so — which should be
downgraded to one per ten minutes if we include the time to maintain
those tests, and perhaps one per thirty minutes if we include the time
I’m asleep or otherwise not working on the project.</p>
<p>So, to the extent that we can get any benefit at all out of running
computer-generated tests, they have a multiplier of around 700 million
· 1800 = 1.3 trillion over human-generated tests, or 30 billion · 1800
= 54 trillion with a 43-kilowatt system.  Writing a test by hand costs
about as much as running 54 trillion randomly-generated tests.  In the
days of the 386, this multiplier was about half a million, and now it’s one to
fifty trillion, or nearly a billion without extra hardware†.
Each of your manual tests need to be worth more than a billion or a
trillion automatic tests to be worthwhile.  (This is not as hard to
achieve as it sounds, particularly when we’re considering tests number
eleven trillion to twelve trillion for the same code; remember that a
trillion is only a bit under 2⁴⁰.)</p>
<p>† If you’re using Python, automated tests lose a factor of 100 or so
because of the interpreter’s poor performance.</p>
<h2>Extending generative testing</h2>
<p>Two obstacles to the usefulness of random testing are reduction and
repeatability.  The initial randomly-generated test case that reveals
the bug may be fairly large and include any number of strange things
not related to the failure, while manually-written test cases are
simple by design.  And, once the failing test case has been found,
it’s important to be able to run it again in the future — otherwise it
doesn’t help you know whether you’ve fixed the bug (or avoided
reintroducing it.)  Hypothesis includes an automated test-case
reduction which reduces the failing case to a (usually) fairly minimal
case before reporting it, and a system for recording previously failed
tests to run again — although I haven’t tried checking them into Git,
and I suspect there might be some impedance mismatches there.</p>
<p>Hypothesis has recently (I think around late 2017) acquired the ability
to combine its generative testing approach with statement coverage
testing, which is where you measure which lines of code were executed
by your tests, so that you can work to focus new tests on lines that
haven’t been tested yet.  In theory, this kind of testing could also
give you a reasonable suspicion of which lines of code were
responsible for a bug.  And you could conceivably augment this with
<a href="http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Marick_experience.pdf">extended kinds of coverage</a> such as loop coverage, multi-condition
coverage, and mutation testing; these are just as expensive to apply
now by hand as when Marick wrote his paper on it, if not more so, but
three orders of magnitude cheaper to apply automatically — Marick was
writing in 1991 or 1992, at a time when the 386 was current, though
not cutting-edge.</p>
<p>Thus a moderate amount of introspection or reflection, like that
needed for statement coverage testing, might enable large gains in
test power.</p>
<h2>Program search</h2>
<p>Earlier I said, “Each of your manual tests need to be worth more than
a billion or a trillion automatic tests to be worthwhile.”  Turning
that on its head, what if you just write the tests and not the
implementation?  In a way, this is the approach behind deep learning:
try to generate a program for a very restricted machine that passes
some large set of tests.</p>
<p>You could imagine a generative testing system like Hypothesis that
suggests code mutations that cause failing test cases to pass; this is
a very small version of “what if you write the tests and not the
implementation?”.  Once you have found a failing test case, you can
try on the order of 50 million modified versions of the code per
second.  Perhaps you could expand this to a practical program search
system by accelerating the process by writing some very verbose test
cases that include some debug messages showing intermediate results
while running the algorithm, so that the Kolmogorov complexity of each
successive search objective is only 16–32 bits, making the search
tractable.</p>
<p>The functional-programming equivalent might be to write test cases for
subordinate functions that can be composed to do the desired
computation.</p>
<p>Michał Zalewski’s American Fuzzy Lop testing system, which provides
random input data to programs to test them (“fuzzing”), uses Unix’s
fork() to virtually “take snapshots” of a process under test at
different times during its execution; this allows it to execute many
more test cases per second, because new test cases can start from the
program state some tens of microseconds before the program exited,
rather than from the beginning.  Using this facility, he has
demonstrated some very impressive results, including constructing a
legal JPEG file by fuzzing a JPEG decoder to find an input file it
would accept.</p>
<p>Linux’s implementation of snapshotting with fork() is unfortunately
rather slow (though faster than other Unixes): some 130 μs on my
laptop to fork() and wait() for a dietlibc-linked child process that
merely invokes exit(), perhaps on another core.  This compares to 0.4
μs for a minor page fault, 0.3 μs to call read(), and probably
something like (guessing based on others’ measurements) 5 μs to
context-switch the core to another already-existing process and
(guessing) 0.1–0.2 μs for a one-way IPC under seL4.</p>
<p>This suggests that, even using conventional protection mechanisms, it
should be possible to take lazy process memory snapshots an order of
magnitude faster than Linux does it, which in turn would make it
practical to take them an order of magnitude more often — every 5 μs,
for example, rather than every 50 μs.  In cases where the the
execution time from the last test case input to getting a test
result — the feedback lag — is on the order of those 5 μs, this is an
order-of-magnitude speedup, but its importance goes far beyond that,
because the input search problem is exponential in the feedback lag.
5 μs is about 12000 instructions, which admits an insanely large
number of possible executions to search through.</p>
<p>This suggests that unconventional protection mechanisms, such as
Valgrind-like machine-code compilation and interpretation, might work
better for program search; by recording every change to memory and
registers, they can rewind the timeline to any arbitrary instruction
execution, at a cost of optimistically 10× to more likely 100×
execution time (and also some memory).  In cases where the feedback
lag can be reduced below, say, 120–1200 instructions, you can thus
fail more tests per second with this approach than by using
arm’s-length mechanisms like virtual memory protection.  With the
Linux implementation, which costs on the order of 300’000
instructions, the crossover point is around 3000–30’000 instructions
of feedback lag; for shorter feedback lags, the Valgrind and
interpreter approaches will work better.</p>
<p>Abstract interpretation techniques can yield bigger speedups in some
cases, like the miniKANREN system that is capable of finding a quine
by searching through possible executions of an interpreter for one
whose output is the same as its input.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
