(6 minutes)</div><h2>Literal facts</h2>
<p>So, I’ve been thinking about a sort of free-text Datalog or Prolog
system that uses string matching.  At the most basic level, you can
put literal facts into it (what Datalog would call ground facts) in
free text:</p>
<pre><code>Romina Vasconcelos lives at Colón 2014 #8.
Valeria Lemmi lives at Suipacha 825.
Valeria Lemmi dances contact improv.
Glenda Quesada dances contact improv.
Glenda Quesada’s phone number is +54 11 4777 4909.
Glenda Quesada lives at Hidalgo 979.
Lunch with Glenda Quesada on 2017-11-22 at O’Higgins 1255.
Lunch with Romina Vasconcelos on 2017-11-23 at Billinghurst 3236.
Valeria Lemmi’s phone number is +54 11 2560 6898.
Glenda Quesada and Valeria Lemmi are friends.
Valeria Lemmi and Juan Pablo Suracco are friends.
</code></pre>
<h2>Simple searches and joins</h2>
<p>And you can search it, at the simplest level, with just a pattern like
'%Valeria Lemmi%' or '% dances contact improv.'  That is already
pretty useful, though not very high tech; it’s basically <code>grep</code>.</p>
<p>The next level, though, is to relate two or more such facts with
patterns containing a common variable.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>Lunch with @who on @when at @where.
@who’s phone number is @phone.
</code></pre>
<p>This finds a single viable assignment of variables out of the above
facts, still based entirely on substring matching:</p>
<pre><code>who             when        where           phone
--------------  ----------  --------------  ----------------
Glenda Quesada  2017-11-22  O'Higgins 1255  +54 11 4777 4909
</code></pre>
<h2>Deduction or inference rules</h2>
<p>At a third level, we can add deduction rules.  For example, with the
premises above the line and the conclusions below:</p>
<pre><code>@a and @b are friends.
----------------------
@a and @b are connected.
</code></pre>
<p>If we add a separate rule which can justify the same conclusion, then
we can get transitive closure:</p>
<pre><code>@a and @b are friends.
@b and @c are connected.
------------------------
@a and @c are connected.
</code></pre>
<p>From this and the above facts we can justify, for example,</p>
<pre><code>Glenda Quesada and Juan Pablo Suracco are connected.
</code></pre>
<p>This much is sufficient to implement basic SQL pointwise queries, but
it doesn’t yet touch issues of quantification, aggregation, negation,
and ordering.  You can get existential quantification simply enough:</p>
<pre><code>@someone’s phone number is @number.
----------------------------------
@someone has a phone.
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this immediately gives you both AND and OR (intersection ∩
and union ∪), though not negation or even abjunction.  You can get AND
with two clauses:</p>
<pre><code>@someone dances contact improv.
@someone lives at Hidalgo @address.
----------------------------------
@someone is acrobatic.
</code></pre>
<p>And you can get OR with two inference rules that can produce the same
result:</p>
<pre><code>@someone and Juan Pablo Suracco are friends.
-------------------------------------------
@someone is cool.

@someone dances contact improv.
------------------------------
@someone is cool.
</code></pre>
<h2>Problems of infinite regress</h2>
<p>In some sense, this string-based formulation is strictly more powerful
than Datalog, in dangerous ways.  For example, given the rule:</p>
<pre><code>@P.
---
It is the case that @P.
</code></pre>
<p>we can derive:</p>
<pre><code>It is the case that Valeria Lemmi lives at Suipacha 825.
It is the case that It is the case that Valeria Lemmi lives at Suipacha 825.
It is the case that It is the case that It is the case that Valeria Lemmi lives at Suipacha 825.
</code></pre>
<p>and so on.</p>
<h2>User interface affordances</h2>
<p>An obvious problem with this kind of naïve text matching is that it’s
very easy to miss records because of very slight textual mismatches.
For example, consider the following pattern:</p>
<pre><code>@who’s phone number is @phone.
</code></pre>
<p>It won’t match the following fact:</p>
<pre><code>Valeria Lemmi’s phone number is +54 11 2560 6898.
</code></pre>
<p>That’s because it uses a different apostrophe, an ASCII one rather
than the Unicode one used in the pattern.  It won’t match this one
either:</p>
<pre><code>Valeria Lemmi’s cellphone number is +54 11 2560 6898.
</code></pre>
<p>Once you become aware of these, you can bridge them with inference
rules:</p>
<pre><code>@who’s cellphone number is @phone.
----------------------------------
@who’s phone number is @phone.
</code></pre>
<p>But in many cases it’s better to avoid them in the first place, which
is best done with user interface affordances.</p>
<p>If you have a set of inference rules like the examples in the earlier
section, or even queries that you are likely to evaluate again, they
can provide a certain amount of guidance to the system about what kind
of data you might want to put into it.  A query result, without any
further inference rules, is a table that you can type more values
into, which immediately provides a quick data-entry user interface.
But also, they provide some amount of hints as to the type structure
of your data.</p>
<pre><code>Lunch with @who on @when at @where.
@who’s phone number is @phone.
</code></pre>
<p>Then, what can we tentatively infer, given the following ground fact?</p>
<pre><code>Valeria Lemmi’s phone number is +54 11 2560 6898.
</code></pre>
<p>We can infer that “Valeria Lemmi” is some kind of meaningful entity,
and it might be worthwhile to make her name a link to a view of all
facts that mention her; and we can also infer that a possible thing
that the user might want to do in that context would be to add a
ground fact of the form “Lunch with Valeria Lemmi on ... at ....” to
the store.  There might even be places where you've planned lunch
before that could be suggested for the location “field”.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
