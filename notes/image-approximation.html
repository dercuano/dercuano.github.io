(10 minutes)</div><p>I’ve mentioned the problem of image approximation in a few different
notes — <a href="../notes/topics-2014.html">Ideas to ship in 2014</a>, <a href="../notes/3d-ui.html">Simplifying computing systems by having fewer kinds of graphics</a>, and <a href="../notes/ideas-to-pursue.html">Ideas to pursue</a>.
Basically the idea is a specific application of mathematical
optimization algorithms: making something look, visually, like some
reference image.  But it turns out to be an interestingly fertile
family of applications.</p>
<p>There’s now a Twitter bot called something like “Minimal Pictures”
which illustrates the idea; it applies some single graphical primitive
(Bézier curves, translucent rectangles, or translucent triangles, for
example) a few hundred times to get an image that looks similar to a
reference image, but not so similar that you can’t see how it’s done.
And in 2016 I wrote a <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/81hacks/see">hill-climbing optimizer to approximate a given
image with opaque irregular
pentagons</a>, with
stunning, but very slow, results.</p>
<p>So here is an attempt to outline the space a bit.</p>
<h2>Design spaces</h2>
<p>A design space is a set of variables the optimization algorithm can
tweak to satisfy its objective of making the right image.  This can be
pretty much anything.  Interesting design spaces include polygons
(translucent or opaque); polylines; Bézier curves; points; DCT
coefficients in a JPEG; images constrained in some way, such as
sparsity, to be convolved with the known, estimated, or optimized OTF
of some optical system; widths and/or slight displacements of a given
set of lines, as in engraving or font hinting; toolpaths, or more
generally robot movement plans; arrangements of a given set of pieces
(overlappable or not, scalable or not, but generally rotatable);
heightfields, 3-dimensional meshes, or other three-dimensional models
such as collections of spheres; parameters controlling a model like a
face puppet; or colors of pixels chosen from a small set, as on an
inkjet printer.</p>
<h2>Similarity metrics</h2>
<p>The simplest similarity metric to optimize is probably just the sum of
squared pixel differences, but this leaves a lot to be desired.  A
very simple alternative is blurring the images a bit first, but there
are many other possibilities.  Transforming the images into Fourier or
Gabor space and then weighting the different spatial frequencies
according to perceptual salience might be an improvement.  A perhaps
more interesting possibility is using the first few layers of a neural
network trained for image classification or in a GAN; this would
presumably put extra weight on things that are important to “real
images” in some sense, and might do a reasonable job of simulating the
first few layers of human visual perception, too.</p>
<p>In some cases, perhaps something like Canny edge detection would be a
useful step in the similarity function, if the visual similarity
you’re going for isn’t purely literal.</p>
<h2>Other objective function components</h2>
<p>The objective function you optimize might not be purely similarity; it
might also include some kind of “cost model” for the design space.
For example, if you’re planning a toolpath, you might want to prefer
faster toolpaths; if you’re trying to approximate an image by deriving
a sparse set of stars or other bright points that have somehow gotten
convolved with a known or unknown OTF, you might want to prefer
sparser sets; you might prefer heightfields that are mostly smooth
rather than containing thousands of sharp spikes; for artistic
purposes, you might want to minimize the number of graphical
primitives used, just to keep the approximation from being too
perfect; and so on.</p>
<h2>Simulation</h2>
<p>In many of these cases, you won’t know how well you’ve actually
approximated the image until you set some kind of physical machinery
in motion.  A robot wielding a pen, a hot wire, a FDM nozzle, or a
milling cutter can produce somewhat unpredictable results.  Also, it’s
slow.  A potentially worse problem is that its results aren’t
differentiable — you can evaluate your objective function over them,
but you may not be able to determine the gradient of the objective
function with respect to your design variables.</p>
<p>So in many cases you’ll want to do some kind of simulation, even if in
the end what you’re optimizing is a physical process.  A numerical
simulation, even of things like robots cutting things, can support
automatic differentiation with respect to your design space, which
enables the use of non-gradient-free optimization algorithms.</p>
<h2>Optimization algorithms</h2>
<p>There’s been an enormous amount of work on variations of gradient
descent in the last few years, largely with an eye to accelerating
learning of parameters for deep neural networks, and there are also a
substantial number of older variants.  This includes Nesterov
accelerated gradient, AdaBoost, AdaGrad, Adam, and so on.</p>
<p>Gradient-based algorithms have an enormous advantage in
high-dimensional design spaces; they tend to slow down linearly with
dimensionality, while gradient-free optimization algorithms commonly
slow down exponentially with dimensionality.</p>
<p>However, other metaheuristics other than gradient descent are
applicable; for example, Nelder–Mead optimization, genetic algorithms,
and simulated annealing.</p>
<p>In some cases, the most appropriate optimization algorithm may
actually be something like a particle filter.</p>
<h2>Purposes</h2>
<p>This family of techniques can be applied to many problems.</p>
<p>The minimal-picture bot mentioned above has output that looks cool.</p>
<p>Non-photorealistic rendering is a useful approach for avoiding the
plasticky hard look of a lot of 3-D rendering.  Image approximation is
a general approach to NPR — you ask for an approximation of a
conventional near-photorealistic rendering, using a design space that
only allows pencil drawing, for example, or pastel chalk painting, and
perhaps using a similarity measure that privileges whatever you think
is most important to preserve, such as edge orientations.</p>
<p>In the opposite direction, a possible way for someone to specify a 3-D
model that can later be used for photorealistic rendering, virtual
puppeteering, or 3-D printing is to sketch it in a non-photorealistic
way, maybe from a few different points of view, then optimize in an
appropriate design space of 3-D models, using photorealistic rendering
to generate the image to be compared to the sketch, and some kind of
similarity metric that emphasizes the features that are likely to
survive.</p>
<p>Autotracing, vectorizing raster images, can be framed as an image
approximation problem: you want to approximate the raster image as
closely as possible with a polyine with a very limited number of
control points.  Carrying this further, you could optimize a
representation of a printed book that consisted of one or more fonts
and a vector of (pageno, x, y, codepoint) tuples, subject to
appropriate penalties for wiggly lines of text and fonts with too many
glyphs, in order to simultaneously OCR the text and digitize the font
used.  This is presumably not too far from what current bilevel image
compression does.</p>
<p>Star tracking for spacecraft orientation control can be viewed as an
effort to approximate a series of images by estimating the camera’s
OTF, the attitude of the spacecraft, and the contents of the galaxy
(although we already have a pretty good prior on that).  Sun glare and
Earth glare need to either be taken into account or somehow ignored by
the similarity metric.</p>
<p>Grid fitting and hinting of fonts can be viewed as an image
approximation problem.  The difficulty with just doing
nearest-neighbor things is that you can end up with uneven spacing,
uneven widths, etc., which are more perceptually salient than what you
got right.  Optimizing the rasterized glyphs according to a perceptual
model, for example in Gabor space, should solve this problem.</p>
<p>Dithering is the problem of approximating an image using only a few
colors, and existing dithering algorithms face unappealing tradeoffs
between edge sharpness and color precision.  By optimizing the
similarity between the dithered image (which, note, is not a
continuous domain) and the original image as measured by a perceptual
model, you should be able to get substantially better results,
privileging edges where those are more perceptually salient, and color
precision where that is, for example where there are no edges.
Dithering algorithms could even take into account LCD subpixels if
it's just a matter of tweaking the similarity function.</p>
<p>Lossy compression is, generally, the problem of approximating an image
using some kind of sparse representation, and is of immense importance
right now.  Again, optimizing the similarity between the original and
decompressed images according to a perceptual model might give
improved results.</p>
<p>Resampling of images to different sizes could also be viewed as a
process of image approximation, using a larger image to approximate a
smaller one, or vice versa.  This requires a similarity metric that
penalizes you if sharp edges get blurry when the image is enlarged.</p>
<p>Structure-from-motion (SfM) and structure-from-shading can be
formulated as image approximation problems; you want to approximate an
image or series of images with a colored point cloud and a camera
trajectory, or possibly some other kind of 3-D model like a
heightfield.  In some cases lighting may be changing.  By using a
sufficiently fancy renderer, specular reflections and refraction can
provide information about 3-D structure.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
