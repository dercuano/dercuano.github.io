(7 minutes)</div><p>I think I know how to print 140 to 200 pages of comfortably naked-eye-
readable text and full-color images on a transparency foil using a
regular 1200dpi laser printer with reasonable resolution and only a
factor of 10 or 20 loss of contrast; you will see different pages of
text from different angles.</p>
<p>In 2001 I came up with this idea of opacity holograms, which is a
multi-image nonsecure version of Naor and Shamir’s visual
cryptography, and in 2007 I figured out how to extend Naor and
Shamir’s idea directly to grayscale.  I’ve been thinking about using
opacity holograms for low-cost text archival in order to take
advantage of the high storage capacity of laser-printed paper without
needing a microscope to read it; but a major problem has been that the
technique I’d come up with, like lenticular 3-D, reduces image
brightness/contrast/resolution by a factor of N to encode N images;
while real holography, using interference patterns you can’t plausibly
print on a regular laser printer, only reduces these by a factor
proportional to √N.  So real holography has, so far, been vastly
superior for encoding large numbers of images in a single image.</p>
<p>I finally think I have a √N technique, but I haven’t tried it yet.</p>
<p>You have N low-resolution truecolor input images to encode, plus a
bilevel “key” image at the resolution of your actual output device,
which could be random but need not be; the crucial features of the
“key” image is that its autocorrelation is very small at all small
spatial shifts other than 0, and that its correlation to any input
image at some small spatial shift is also very small.  As the key is
bilevel, each of its pixels is either black or white, which we will
consider as -1 and 1.  Its autocorrelation at small shifts being very
small requires that it be almost exactly half black.  When
laser-printed on a transparency film, the black pixels of the key will
obscure corresponding pixels of the output image, while the white
pixels will remain transparent.</p>
<p>Each of the N input images is encoded with the key at a different
spatial shift, one at which it is effectively uncorrelated with the
key.  Each encoded pixel is equal to the corresponding input pixel if
the corresponding key pixel is white, or color-inverted from the
corresponding input pixel otherwise: black for white, white for black,
red for cyan, 50% gray for 50% gray, and so on.  That is, we multiply
the spatially shifted key by the input, considering medium gray as 0,
black as -1, and white as 1.  Since the “key” image contains very
little large-scale variation in black-pixel density, each of the
encoded images will appear entirely as a flat medium gray from a
distance, or random noise, close up; but if either multiplied by or
obscured by the key image, a close approximation of the input image is
visible.</p>
<p>What’s the distribution of that random noise?  It’s guaranteed to have
a mean of medium gray, but beyond that, it could be anything from
constant medium gray to a bimodal distribution where all the pixels
are either white or black.</p>
<p>Then, we sum all of these encoded images (without saturating!) to
produce a combined encoded image.  From the perspective of any
individual encoded image, this amounts to adding Gaussian noise whose
variance is proportional to the number of other input images
(multiplied, I guess, by how far they tend to get from medium gray).
So we can expect that the noise from adding 100 images will be only
about 6× worse than the noise from adding 3.</p>
<p>Converting this into something you can actually see on the screen or
print is a little tricky.  The combined encoded image will probably
have a nearly Gaussian distribution of color, which means it’s barely
using most of its dynamic range.  To display on the screen, it’s
probably okay to lop off the tails of the distribution at a point that
most (say, 99%) of the pixels are accounted for; but then dithering is
a problem, because regular dithering will shift errors to neighboring
pixels on the theory that your eye will kind of blur them together.
But that doesn’t work if your eye can't see the neighboring pixels
because they’re obscured by the key image.  Fixed dithering would
work, and so would random dithering, but you’ve already effectively
done a bunch of random dithering by adding other effectively random
images.  So nearest-neighbor “dithering”, which amounts to mere
thresholding at the median in the case of a bilevel device like a B&amp;W
laser printer, is probably just fine.</p>
<p>You could print the key on one side of transparency film (preferably
archival polyester, not acetate, which is prone to vinegar syndrome)
and the combined encoded image on the other.  The pixel shifts you can
get with the parallax between the different sides of normal
transparency film add up to somewhere around a hundredth of an inch
total, so you should be able to get up to about, say, 12 to 14 by 12
to 14 (144 to 196) separate spatial shifts for the key; so you can
encode that many different documents on a sheet.</p>
<p>The noise will reduce the contrast.  If you have 144 documents adding
together, the noise will be about 10 or 20 times larger than the
“signal” of the input image you’re trying to decode.  This means that
input features that are smaller than about 30 to 200 pixels will be
swamped by the noise. 100 pixels (10 pixels square) at 1200dpi is a
120th of an inch square, which compares favorably to normal computer
monitors and old dot-matrix printers, although it’s lower-quality than
we're used to seeing on laser printers.  At that resolution, my
6-pixel-high font could still fit 20 lines of text per inch (a point
size of 3.6 points), which is too small for normal people to read
comfortably.  Six lines of text per inch was traditional for computer
printers.</p>
<p>You could also use this technique to share a single computer monitor
between different people, or between the two eyes of a single
stereoscopic user, or even to provide an easy hands-free way to shift
between virtual desktops: mount the key image on transparency film
some hundreds of microns in front of the monitor, and merge the video
images for the different angles by using different shifts of the key.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/archival.html">Archival</a> (34 notes)
