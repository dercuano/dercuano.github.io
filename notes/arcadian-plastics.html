(3 minutes)</div><p>The thought that we<br />
must eliminate single-use disposable goods<br />
must eliminate plastics<br />
proceeds not from environmentalism but from Arcadianism<br />
humans for a hundred thousand generations had to cling to dead things<br />
good linen, stone houses, stone tools, bone needles, bronze, steel, brass, gold<br />
cling to a scrap of cloth like a grandmother, for it too cares for you through the winter<br />
this Arcadian longing for those lost generations is anti-life<br />
life is not tasteful<br />
life is not restrained<br />
life is not frugal<br />
life is not conservative<br />
life is not lasting<br />
those are not virtues for life<br />
those are virtues for human capital accumulation</p>
<p>life is exuberant<br />
life is a wild, ever-changing fire upon the surface of the earth<br />
life is algae blooming in a red tide<br />
life is ceaseless but never constant<br />
life is the merciless <br />
life is the struggle of a thousand salmon that leap frantically past the bears<br />
before laying five thousand eggs, destroying their viscera with steroids<br />
life is a sequoia seed awaiting its awakening by fire<br />
to sprout in the ashes<br />
life is eager dandelions growing brightly in the cracks of the sidewalk<br />
life is desperate air plants drilling for moisture in the rain forest bark<br />
life is a thousand-year-old ginkgo slowly consumed by a fungus in its heartwood<br />
protecting its delicious nuts with the stench of ten thousand corpses<br />
life is unstable, exciting, impermanent, and full of death<br />
life is refulgent purple jacarandá flowers covering you in brilliant yellow pollen<br />
life is a peaceful marsh where a crocodile is resting just under the water</p>
<p>when a mushroom is fabricated overnight in the forest<br />
more intricate than the carvings of any sculptor<br />
more beautiful than the brushstrokes of any painter<br />
it is made of a single-use disposable biopolymer<br />
and is gone inside a week</p>
<p>trees regret not shedding leaves made of single-use disposable biopolymer<br />
wolves ferociously devour single-use rabbits made of biopolymers and leave disposable droppings</p>
<p>humans had to cling to dead scraps of cloth and care for them like newborn babies<br />
could not change raiment with the seasons as the snow hare or the goldfinch do<br />
because a spool of yarn was a day's work</p>
<p>a century ago a tarnished mirror was a sign of wealth<br />
today they lie discarded in the gutters</p>
<p>those who know the secrets of life and the nature of matter<br />
can use its own materials for their products<br />
they are no longer limited to heavy, fragile clay, rusting iron, and dead wood<br />
but can use the diaphanous resins we call plastics<br />
to carry water or adorn their children<br />
they can evaporate aluminum onto glass that floated on tin<br />
their children can race carbon-fiber bicycles</p>
<p>a cellophane wrapper, a sterile catheter, a condom<br />
betoken the liberation of the humans from the toil of a hundred thousand generations<br />
and pitiless disease that killed one out of every five children before adulthood  </p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script></html>
