(8 minutes)</div><p>There's a relatively simple derivative-free algorithm with superlinear
convergence for finding minima or maxima of regular one-dimensional
functions, analogous to the method of secants for finding their
zeroes.  But under almost all circumstances there are better
algorithms.</p>
<h2>Deriving successive parabolic interpolation</h2>
<p>In <a href="../notes/%25241-recognizer-diagrams.html">$1 recognizer diagrams</a> it is mentioned that the $1
recognizer uses golden-section search, a la <em>Numerical Recipes</em>, to
approximate the optimal rotation.  This algorithm has very slow
convergence, similar to binary chop for finding function zeroes.</p>
<p>Is there a way to adapt the method of secants (see <a href="../notes/genetic-secants.html">Using the method of secants for general optimization</a>) to approximate the minimum faster?  If you have
three points (suppose, WOLOG, in order) <em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub> and the function values
<em>y</em><sub>0</sub> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>), <em>y</em><sub>1</sub> =
<em>f</em>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>), <em>y</em><sub>2</sub> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>), then you
can calculate some divided differences: (<em>y</em><sub>1</sub> -
<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>)/(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> - <em>x</em><sub>0</sub>) gives you
precisely the average of the derivative on (<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>), and similarly for (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>).  If the second derivative is small, these give us
good estimates for the derivative <em>f</em>' at ½(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub> +
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>) and ½(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>).  From those
two, we should be able to linearly interpolate or extrapolate to find
where the derivative should have a zero crossing, and we can sample
another point there, <em>y</em><sub>4</sub> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em><sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p>This vaguely sounds like Nelder-Mead simplex optimization, but in one
dimension, but I don't understand Nelder-Mead well enough to know.</p>
<p>Since this is just looking for a zero of the derivative, it will
equally well find maxima or minima, depending on the average second
derivative in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>In essence, this amounts to calculating the extremum of a parabola fit
to the last three points.</p>
<p>So let's work this out.</p>

<p>On simple examples like <code>x =&gt; x * (1 - x) + 0.001 * x*x*x, 0.2, 0.1</code>
it seems to have pretty fast convergence, appearing close to the order
<em>φ</em> of convergence like the one-dimensional method of secants.  If it
happens to run into a horizontal line, though, it fails; for example,
<code>x =&gt; x * (1 - x)**2, 0, 1</code> crashes out at 0.5 because <em>f</em>(0) =
<em>f</em>(1).  The actual maximum is, of course, 1/3, and a better starting
point finds it.  (And there's a minimum at 1.)</p>
<p>It seems to have some difficulty with rounding, only producing about 9
places of accuracy in that last example, perhaps because the
second-derivative expression above becomes very small.</p>
<p>The lines marked <code>(redundant)</code> above are things that, after the first
iteration, were already calculated in the previous iteration, so we
can avoid calculating them again.  What's left over is one function
evaluation, five subtractions, an addition, a division by two, three
arbitrary divisions, and an operation that can be either a division or
a multiplication.  To me four divisions per iteration seems kind of
heavy-weight.</p>
<p>You might think it would have poor convergence because when we sample
the new point there, we are in effect sampling the derivative halfway
between that new point and the last old point, so we're only getting
halfway to the destination.  But we're only delaying convergence by
one iteration --- if that derivative-average and the last one point to
a place very close to the new point, because the second derivative is
almost constant over that interval, the new new point will be very
close indeed.  So it works out.</p>
<p>It actually can tell whether the extremum it's approaching is a
maximum or a minimum, because the estimate that it gets of the second
derivative tells it.  By replacing a <code>d2</code> with <code>abs(d2)</code> in the above
code, we could make it seek only extrema of one kind.</p>
<p>Unlike the method-of-secants stuff in <a href="../notes/genetic-secants.html">Using the method of secants for general optimization</a>, it isn't
apparent to me how to extend this to functions of vector arguments,
functions of more than one argument, or vector-valued functions.</p>
<h2>This is called "successive parabolic approximation" and you should almost never use it</h2>
<p>The realization that this amounts to fitting a parabola to the last
three points led me to the discovery that the standard name for this
method is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successive_parabolic_interpolation">successive parabolic interpolation</a>"; Wikipedia explains
that it has an order of convergence of about 1.33 and has robustness
problems.  In particular, though, the fact that it's less than √2
means that it's slower than using Newton-Raphson iteration on a
derivative evaluated using automatic differentiation, other than
faster, as with the method of secants.</p>
<p>The divided-differences approach given above is, I think, faster than
the approach I've found elsewhere of solving the Vandermonde linear
system, because it's more incremental.  But divided differences is of
course a standard way to do polynomial interpolation, and its
incrementality is one of its standard advantages.</p>
<p>The only time when it is faster to use successive parabolic
interpolation rather than Newton-Raphson iteration is when you can't
differentiate the function you're optimizing, even though you believe
it to be regular, for example because it's experimentally measured
rather than computed, or because your software tools are outdated and
don't support automatic differentiation, or because its second
derivative fails to exist.  (If its first derivative fails to exist,
successive parabolic interpolation won't work either.)  In such a
situation, golden-section search is slower, but sometimes only for
high precision; and golden-section search is more robust and doesn't
have the rounding problems mentioned above.  (The <code>optimize</code> function
in R uses a mixture of golden-section search and successive parabolic
interpolation known as Brent's method.)</p>
<p>So, for example, <code>min_next_n(x =&gt; (1/x - 4)**2 , 0.001, 0.1, 30)</code> in
the above evaluator takes 7 iterations to converge to within 0.1 of
the correct result (0.25), 6 more iterations to converge to within
0.01 of the correct result, and 2 more iterations to converge to
within 0.001 of the correct result, at which point it starts having
reasonable convergence.  I think golden-section search would actually
be faster up to that point, although I haven't tried it.  However, for
functions that are well approximated by a quadratic, successive
parabolic interpolation is really fast; for example, in <code>min_next_n(x
=&gt; Math.sin(x*Math.PI) + Math.sin(x*2*Math.PI), 0.001, 0.1, 30)</code> it
eventually converges to 0.29791559955277436, but it's already at
0.2987 in 5 iterations.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
