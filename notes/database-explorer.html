(2 minutes)</div><p>Zing!  Poof!  Bam!  Let’s explore this database, composing queries
that make sense, one step at a time, with feedback after each
keystroke.</p>
<p>Start typing the name of a table or column.  See the names of the
matching tables, along with their data.  Tab, type another, see them
together.  See likely candidate join columns highlighted, with quick
keystrokes to select them.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the database explorer is shitting out hundreds of
queries a second and pulling a few rows from each one, using multiple
different worker threads in case one of the queries is unresponsive.</p>
<p>An operand stack is displayed, updated after each keystroke.
Available keystroke commands apply to the top stack items, but
shuffling them around is easy.  Since each value on the stack is an
entire relation (associated with the expression that produced it) it
can occupy potentially much more space than you have on your screen.
The displayed summary includes the most common values in each column
and, in some cases, other presentations such as maps for geodata.</p>
<p>As you type them, numbers and literal strings are incrementally
searched for at the beginnings of all indexed columns and, if time
permits, unindexed columns too.</p>
<p>The interface is modeless, so all the command (“accelerator”) keys are
modified with control or alt, and the available commands are always
displayed in the UI.</p>
<p>Once you have the query you want, you can convert it to SQL.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
