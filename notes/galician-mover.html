(2 minutes)</div><p>On my way home today (2015-11-09) in T-shirt and jogging shorts, I met
an retired Galician furniture mover named José, digging a ditch in the
sidewalk with a battered shovel under an overcast sky.  Sweat dripped
off his face, and he showed me his knee-replacement scar, and I felt
his rock-hard Popeye forearm.  There on the sidewalk, we talked about
what motivates people to honesty and about the difficulties he had had
with police demanding bribes when he was in business and the
difficulties with employees.  I told stories about Diogenes of Sinope.</p>
<p>He told me of a time, 40 years ago, when he was moving furniture for
the former propaganda chief of the SS, who had retired to Argentina
after the war.  The man told him that propaganda could persuade
brothers to kill one another.</p>
<p>He also told me of a time when he was 17, working as a mover for his
father.  After finishing up the job, he presented the bill to the
customer, a friend of his father's.  The customer said he would pay
his father.  He went home and told his father, and his father asked,
"Why didn't you collect then?"</p>
<p>"I figured he'd pay you.  He's your friend!"</p>
<p>"I don't have any friends!" laughed his father.</p>
<p>And, sure enough, the man never paid.</p>
<p>As I said goodbye to José, the lightning began, and then the
hailstorm.  I shivered in my soaked T-shirt in the freezing rain.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/argentina.html">Argentina</a> (12 notes)
