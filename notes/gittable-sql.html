(6 minutes)</div><p>Suppose you want to store a SQL database in Git.</p>
<p>This occurred to me because I wanted to restore an old website from
backups.  All the static text files in CVS were fine, but the database
was stored in MySQL, and consequently had been lost, and so the CGI
scripts didn’t work.  If we had stored the database in more static
text files, we could have avoided this problem.  You could even have
accessed the CSV files over HTTP from JS, since they didn’t contain
any secret information.  I wished we’d used CSV instead of SQL,
although of course this wouldn’t work for heavy update loads or
certain kinds of atomic updates.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>We’d like to support the usual SQL operations (not just the DML
INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE but also the DDL CREATE TABLE, DROP
TABLE, CREATE INDEX, foreign key constraints, etc.) with transaction
rates, data sizes, query evaluation times similar to those of older
SQL databases (say, up to 16 transactions per second (across the whole
system, not on a single host)), on up to 64 gigabytes or 2 billion
records of data, with simple queries answered in tens of
milliseconds), but with the ability to replicate the database using
Git to different hosts (say, up to 128), update any replica, and then
synchronize that change to all the replicas using Git.</p>
<p>Git’s decentralized model means you can’t guarantee most of the
consistency constraints a regular SQL database would guarantee: if A.B
references C.D, you can insert a record into A on one host and delete
the record it references from C on another host, which respects the
consistency constraint on each host, but violates it when they are
merged.</p>
<p>So you’ll have to settle for inconsistency detection and resolution in
some cases, rather than prevention.  Still, it seems like it should be
possible to do a reasonable job for many cases.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of the building materials</h2>
<p>Much of this applies to storing databases in text files in general,
not just in Git.</p>
<p>Git isn’t super great at merging binary data files or storing huge
files (over, say, 1MB), so it would be better to avoid those.  But it
uses xdelta compression and gzip, so formats with redundant data
aren’t that costly, and might be easier to merge.  Most of the
standard database algorithms apply pretty straightforwardly to text
files, needing only a little bit of extra work.</p>
<p>Git also doesn’t do well with repositories storing a large number of
files, say, over 100,000; and its efficiency begins to suffer when
individual directories are more than a few kilobytes (say, more than a
few hundred files).  Also, Unix filesystems traditionally don’t work
well with more than a few hundred files in a directory, although the
modern ones scale up to 10,000 files in a directory without much pain.</p>
<p>Git does provide atomic updates across multiple different files, which
Unix filesystems do not.  If you are providing HTTP access to some
mutable text files stored in a directory, that also doesn’t provide
atomic updates across multiple files, but if you map Git’s data model
into HTTP URL space, it would.  Git’s git-http-backend command already
supports this via the “backwards-compatible dumb HTTP protocol”, which
is also what you use when you clone a Git repository from the <code>.git</code>
directory on a plain-Jane HTTP server serving up files.  This is
achieved typically by updating <code>.git/refs/heads/master</code> to point to a
new commit object (implicitly in <code>.git/objects</code> or possibly a pack;
this could be mapped more cleanly into HTTP) that you have just
finished creating.</p>
<p>Ideally you wouldn’t store indices or materialized views in Git, just
the data they were computed from (including the index creation
specification).  And ideally you’d minimize unnecessary update
conflicts by usually not updating the same files on different hosts.
Also, it would be desirable to minimize the amount of work necessary
when you pull new changes from somewhere else.</p>
<p>In some cases, a table may have small contents but a large change
history — where it’s kept small to keep access fast.  In other cases,
a table may have contents that are nearly as large as its change
history.  Generally, conflict resolution can work better if you have
more information about history.  For example, in the
A.B-references-C.D case above, you could undelete the deleted C record
and perhaps roll back the transaction it was committed in and enqueue
a post-hoc-rollback notification.</p>
<p>(In still other cases, you may have a non-retention requirement to
truly erase security-sensitive data, and in those cases you shouldn’t
use Git at all.)</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>This suggests two different designs: one where you simply store
source-segregated update logs, treating the actual table contents in
some sense merely as a materialized view of the update log, and one
where you store segmented actual table contents.</p>
<h3>Storing source-segregated update logs</h3>
<p>In this design, what you version-control are unbounded-size logical
logs of your database transactions, one log per host, separated into
segments of some maximum size.  These logs might store the actual SQL
statements, each associated with some transaction ID:</p>
<pre><code>t150 begin
t150 delete from users where name = 'brett'
t151 update users where seen &lt; '20150101' set seen = '20150101'
t151 rollback
t150 commit
</code></pre>
<p>Or they might store individual record updates identified by some
primary key:</p>
<pre><code>t150 begin
t150 delete from users where id = 2804
t151 update users where id = 2018 set seen = '20150101'
t151 update users where id = 2021 set seen = '20150101'
t151 update users where id = 2029 set seen = '20150101'
t151 rollback
t150 commit
</code></pre>
<p>You could store this data separately for each table, say in a
subdirectory for each table, but you run the risk of </p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/databases.html">Databases</a> (20 notes)
