(3 minutes)</div><p>You can construct the relation describing your desired program by
composing it from binary relations.</p>
<p>I just woke up from a nightmare where I was scheduled to give a talk
tonight at one of my two employers about some work I had just done,
when the other employer informed me that they considered that work
confidential to them and covered under my NDA to them, so I wasn’t
going to be able to give the talk.  Since neither employer actually
exists, this document briefly describes the work.</p>
<p>Binate is a particularly terse way of writing down relations by
algebraically composing them from more primitive, binary relations.
It can only express binary relations, but it can express binary
relations among tuples, so that isn’t actually a limitation.</p>
<p>In particular, you write relations in terms of more primitive
relations using conjunction or intersection <code>,</code>, union <code>;</code>, converse
or inverse <code>~</code>, composition (concatenation), transitive closure <code>*</code>,
either negation <code>!</code> or set subtraction <code>-</code>, and a form of N-ary
Cartesian product: <code>{x: a, y: b, ...}</code> produces a relation from the
intersection of the domains of a and b etc. to a set of tuples which
are the domain of the new relations x and y etc., whose codomains are
the codomains of a and b etc. respectively, constructed in the only
reasonable way.  Literals are treated as relations from the entire
universe to that literal.  This turns out to be sufficient to express
anything you can express in Codd’s N-ary relational algebra or
relational calculus.</p>
<p>Kanren is a family of relational programming languages in which you
program not by constructing functions but by constructing more general
relations, which is to say that when you invoke them on different
occasions, you can change your mind about which arguments are inputs
and which are outputs.  This sounds like Prolog, but because Prolog
contains a lot of extralogical operators, its ability to generalize is
limited.</p>
<p>When using Prolog semantics, the major advantage of Binate over Prolog
is that programs are dramatically terser because they are point-free.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>ancestor = parent parent*.
father = parent, "male" ~sex.
sibling = parent ~parent.
cousin = parent sibling ~parent.
</code></pre>
<p>The major advantage of Kanren and relational programming over
functional programming is that, in cases where you need to use both a
function and its inverse, you avoid having to write the inverse
explicitly, which sort of doubles your programming power.  Indeed, a
function of multiple arguments may have many inverses, and you only
have to write it once.  Additionally, it’s often much easier to
describe a predicate you would like to find instances to satisfy than
it is to describe an algorithm to generate them — this is the general
virtue of constraint-oriented programming or programming with
solvers — and at times you would like to change the search or solver
algorithm without changing the predicate you are trying to satisfy.</p>
<p>So, the trade-secret insight from my dream was this: by composing your
program out of binary relations, you can describe the computation you
want in a somewhat terser fashion than any previous language.  You can
beat APL for terseness.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
