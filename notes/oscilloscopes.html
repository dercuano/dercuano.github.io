is a more or less typical cheap used analog oscilloscope: the 20MHz
Protek P-3502C.  The price is AR$3500 = US$232.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tek.com/oscilloscope/tbs1000b-digital-storage-oscilloscope">http://www.tek.com/oscilloscope/tbs1000b-digital-storage-oscilloscope</a>
Tektronix’s cheapest current scope is this TBS1000B line; the
lowest-end scope in the line is the TBS1032B, with 500Msps and 30MHz
analog bandwidth, for US$450, with a recording length of 2500 points.</p>
<p><a href="http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-620039875-osciloscopio-hantek-6022-be-20-mhz-_JM">http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-620039875-osciloscopio-hantek-6022-be-20-mhz-_JM</a>
is a typical USB oscilloscope: the Hantek HT6022BE20MHz: 20MHz,
AR$5000 (=US$331), 1MΩ 25pF input impedance, 48Msps, 8-bit resolution,
20mV to 5V gain range.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/item_detail.html?p_id=736">https://www.seeedstudio.com/item_detail.html?p_id=736</a> is the Seeed
Studio DSO Quad 4-channel Digital Storage Oscilloscope, which costs
US$169.  It claims 72 Msps but doesn’t make any claims about analog
input bandwidth on its two analog input channels.  IIRC Seeed is an
open-hardware shop; they do publish <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/1/10/DSO_Quad_V2.7_schematic.pdf">DSO Quad schematics</a> and the
<a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/DSO_Quad">Wiki lists user apps</a> and it seems like they’re using an
AD9288BSTZ-40 for their ADC.</p>
<p>It seems like you ought to be able to meet or exceed the capabilities
of the Hantek unit for a much lower price, especially using recycled
chips.  I mean basically this is two high-speed ADCs (or one with a
demultiplexed input) hooked up to a USB interface in a metal box,
right?</p>
<p>Three candidate ADCs are the US$3.69 <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/ADS830E-2K5/ADS830ETR-ND/272012">TI ADS830E/2K5</a>, the US$4.50
<a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/maxim-integrated/MAX19505ETM-T/MAX19505ETM-TTR-ND/2044960">Maxim MAX19505ETM+T</a>, and the US$3.28 <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/analog-devices-inc/AD9283BRSZ-50/AD9283BRSZ-50-ND/621671">Analog Devices AD9283BRSZ-50</a>,
which last is available in quantity 1 from Digi-Key at US$6.01.</p>
<p>The AD9283 family is 90mW, has 475 MHz analog bandwidth, a 46.5 SNR, a
1V p-p analog input range, and runs off 3 volts.  “Low-cost digital
oscilloscopes” are explicitly called out as a use for the thing in its
datasheet; <a href="http://matthewlai.ca/blog/?p=441">Matthew Lai designed such a scope</a> based on a slightly
higher-speed member of the family.  It claims ENOB of 7.5 bits at 27
MHz input, which is better than the Hantek unit.</p>
<p>Its input capacitance is only 2 pF.  It says its input resistance is
only 7 to 13 kΩ, which seem to be pullup and pulldown resistors to the
power rails.  So you probably need some kind of preamp, like maybe an
opamp or something, to get high input impedance.</p>
<p>Lai’s design uses an FPGA to buffer the digitized signal.  The
Seeedstudio design uses both an FPGA and also an ARM Cortex
microcontroller.</p>
<p>Lai’s design's analog front end was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Input goes into a 1MΩ metal film resistor in parallel with 20pF
ceramic cap (not sure about this). Buffered by a Texas Instruments
OPA656 wideband op amp with JFET input (very high impedance, which
we need, because the probe has high input impedance. Downside?
bloody expensive).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a variety of OPA656 parts; <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/OPA656U/OPA656U-ND/431969">Digi-Key has the OPA656U</a> at
US$10.69, but I think he may have used a slightly more expensive one,
but maybe the price has come down since 2010.  The OPA656 family seems
like it might be somewhat overkill for this, with a 230MHz bandwidth
and gain-bandwidth product, 70 mA output current (!!), and 65dB
open-loop voltage gain.</p>
<p>Lai’s total BOM cost is US$107.58; a quarter of this is these op-amps,
and another quarter is the THS7002 preamp.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
