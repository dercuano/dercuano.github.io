(2 minutes)</div><p>Image compression algorithms work, in some sense, by finding a good
way to predict the value of each pixel from the already-known pixels,
and then correcting the prediction more or less.  (It's kind of a
stretch to apply this description to JPEG, I guess...)</p>
<p>One possible predictor is a simple spline fit to the previous pixels.
If it's zero-order, this reduces in some sense to RLE; first-order
predicts gradients; second-order and higher may not be useful.</p>
<p>A more interesting predictor for screenshots is perhaps a KNN
predictor: given the so-far decoded pixel data, what are the K
previously-decoded pixels whose environment was most similar?
Perhaps, for concreteness, we take the two pixels above, two pixels to
the left, and one pixel diagonally up and to the left.  Let's take
them in grayscale so we only have a 5-dimensional parameter space,
since RGB TrueColor would form a 15-dimensional parameter space.</p>
<p>Now we can search the so-far-decoded image for the K pixels whose
environments are most similar to our current environment, using
e.g. Manhattan distance, and take the mean or, more likely, median of
their color to form our predictor of the current pixel's color.</p>
<p>5 dimensions is small enough that we could reasonably build a k-d tree
to keep the search efficient.</p>
<p>My thought is that the vast majority of pixels in screenshot
environments would have exactly the predicted color, because those 5
pixels have enough information to nearly uniquely identify the font
glyph, pixel position within that glyph, and background color that
we're looking at.  That means you can encode the average residual in
less than a bit, particularly if you accept some quantization noise.</p>
<p>(We might want to do some kind of dimensionality reduction, e.g. PCA,
to be able to use color and more than 5 pixels.)</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
