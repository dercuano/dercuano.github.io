(2 minutes)</div><p>Doing bit-parallel operations with bit-parallel instructions on big
bitvectors is a useful way to do computations with very high
efficiency when you have enough independent computations.  Bringing
together bits from different bitplanes requires some kind of
bit-shuffling or transposition operations, but the question remains
which of the involute number of possible permutations should be
provided.  For example, if each of the 64 bits of a 64-bit output word
can be a copy of any of the 64 bits of the input word, there are 64⁶⁴
possible operations; specifying one of them would require 384 bits.</p>
<p>In essence this is a new face of the “topomania” problem faced in
parallel computer design in the 1980s and early 1990s, with bit
positions in all the register taking the role of processors.  The
typical early solution was a hypercube topology, in which, say, a
1024-processor CM-1 would have 10 communication links per processor.</p>
<p>This seems like a perfectly adequate solution to me.  Given a 256-bit
register, 16 bit-shuffling operations suffice to construct a useful
hypercube:</p>
<pre><code>rot(0) exchanges even and odd bits, taking ...ABCDEFGH to ...BADCFEHG
rot(1) exchanges even and odd bitpairs: ...ABCDEFGH → ...CDABGHEF
rot(2) exchanges even and odd nibbles: ...ABCDEFGH → ...EFGHABCD
rot(3) exchanges even and odd bytes;
rot(4) exchanges even and odd wydes;
rot(5) exchanges even and odd 32-bit words;
rot(6) exchanges even and odd 64-bit words;
rot(7) exchanges the two 128-bit halves of the register.
</code></pre>
<p>To these rot(n) operations we add copy(n) operations which discard
half of the bits (say, the high half) instead of exchanging them:</p>
<pre><code>copy(0): ...ABCDEFGH → ...BBDDFFHH
copy(1): ...ABCDEFGH → ...CDCDGHGH
copy(2): ...ABCDEFGH → ...EFGHEFGH
</code></pre>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>It’s not very important, I think, which direction the copy operations
copy; copy(n) ∘ rot(n) will copy in the other direction instead.</p>
<p>I think this provides adequate routing facilities for many aggregate
computations.  Together with an analogous set of instructions for
filling registers with index bit patterns (…10101010, …11001100,
…11110000, …) it should enable fairly general and efficient bit-sliced
programming.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
