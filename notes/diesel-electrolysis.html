(2 minutes)</div><p>Is it energetically feasible to run a diesel engine on diesel fuel
combusted with oxygen derived from electrolysis of water, driven from
the engine itself?  Although there's no fundamental thermodynamic
reason such a thing is impossible, presumably it isn't, or military
diesel submarines would do it.</p>
<p>NEL Hydrogen claims their commercially available electrolysis
apparatus electrolyzes hydrogen gas from seawater at 49 kWh/m³ at STP;
this presumably means it also produces
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen">oxygen</a> from water at about 98
kWh/m³, which at 1.429 g/ℓ is about 68.6 kWh/kg.  This is 247 MJ/kg,
which is about 6× the specific energy from burning common fuels such
as diesel fuel (43 MJ/kg) with oxygen.</p>
<p>It gets worse, though, because burning those fuels requires a much
larger amount of oxygen than the fuel: a CH<sub>2</sub> unit, weighing
14 daltons, becomes a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule and an H<sub>2</sub>O
molecule, using 48 daltons of oxygen.  So actually burning diesel fuel
gives you 43 MJ per kg of diesel, but only 43 × 14 ÷ 48 = 12.5 MJ per
kg of oxygen.  So you only get back about 5% of the electrolysis
energy when you use the oxygen.  That's really, really far from being
viable.</p>
<p>So you can't run a diesel engine on water and diesel fuel.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> things that have such a strong affinity for oxygen that
you can burn them with oxygen from water for a net energy gain; sodium
is probably the best-known example.  As far as I know, all of them
pose serious practical problems for use in a heat engine.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/physics.html">Physics</a> (119 notes)
