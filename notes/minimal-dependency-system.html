<p>(See also <a href="../notes/minimal-transaction-system.html">Minimal transaction system</a>.)</p>
<p>This is a miniature operating system in which computations are
executed in response to changes in the filesystem, and which in turn
can create more changes in the filesystem.</p>
<p>Transactions run.  How they were started, I do not know; but they do
run.  A transaction looks at some part of the filesystem, then creates
more files, then exits successfully, making its output files available
to other transactions.  The input files and dirents that went into
creating them are automatically recorded; if any of them change, the
transaction is re-executed, updating the files.</p>
<p>When a file is created, its creator specifies an invalidation policy.
With the default invalidation policy, the invalid version of the file
remains available while the transaction is being re-executed, and if
the transaction doesn’t change the file’s contents, then transactions
that depend on that file won’t be re-executed either.  There’s also a
“strict” invalidation policy which immediately invalidates any
transactions that accessed the file, re-executing them afterwards.
Attempts from outside of transactions to access a strict file that’s
being recomputed will block or give an error, I don’t know.</p>
<p>(I’m not sure whether I need the same thing on read edges.)</p>
<h2>A pure memoization variant</h2>
<p>The fundamental operation is to apply a function to an argument,
producing, eventually, a result.  The argument and the result are
namespaces — filesystem directories, basically; the function is a
blob, a program.  The system monitors which parts of the argument are
accessed by the function and what system resources it needed and
caches the production of the result on that basis.</p>
<p>On Linux, the minimal grain size for process execution is on the order
of a millisecond; a fork/exit/wait loop takes about 130 μs per
iteration at best on my laptop, up to a few milliseconds with large
memory maps or on slower processors.  If a function is going to take
much longer than a millisecond, it should farm out the work to
subfunctions as much as possible, enabling both caching and
distribution.  We might be able to do better and get down into the
deep submillisecond range.</p>
<p>130 μs is about 200 base cases of <code>fib = lambda n: 1 if n &lt; 2 else
fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)</code> in Python on the same machine.</p>
<p>How much data are we talking about caching?  <code>yes</code> can feed data to
<code>dd</code> at about 800 MB/s, or 800 kB/ms.  <code>seq</code> can generate about 128 MB
of numbers per second (128 kB/ms) and <code>gzip -9</code> compresses them by
about 4× at about 1.8 MB/s (1.8 kB/ms) output, or 7.2 MB/s (7.2 kB/ms)
input.  So the individual output files we’re caching could reasonably
be from about a kilobyte up to about a megabyte, but of course larger
results will contain many such files together.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/performance.html">Performance</a> (149 notes)
