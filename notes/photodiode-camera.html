(16 minutes)</div><p>High-speed cameras are a crucial sensor technology for a variety of
purposes, including high-speed robotics with camera feedback (see <a href="../notes/starfield-servo.html">Starfield servo</a> and <a href="../notes/v-plotter-servo.html">Servoing a V-plotter with a webcam?</a>) and analysis of
high-speed physical events, such as breaking glass or basically
anything solid objects do on the micron scale or below.  But existing
high-speed cameras, based on CMOS and CCD sensors, are expensive and
sometimes hard to get for other reasons.</p>
<p>How about photodiodes for faster, cheaper camera focal planes?</p>
<h2>What photodiodes are like</h2>
<p>Cheap photodiodes can be astoundingly fast compared to a typical
camera sensor.  The Fairchild QSD2030 5-mm IR photodiode has 5-ns
response time, passes 25 μA at 0.5 mW/cm² and 5 V, and 10 nA dark
current (at 10 V); it costs 53¢ at Digi-Key.  The OSRAM SFH 2701
infrared photodiode (400-1050 nm) passes 1.4 μA under the same
conditions, and boasts 2-ns response times, for 95¢ (48¢ in quantity
100).</p>
<p>In the subnanosecond range, prices do start to heat up, because you're
getting into avalanche photodiodes and silicon photomultipliers; the
Marktech MTAPD-07-003 infrared avalanche photodiode (which can detect
down to 400 nm, though at 600 nm its responsivity is already cut in
half) is specified for a 300 picosecond rise time, and it claims
35–50 μA at 1 μW of incident light (on its 230-μm-diameter
sensor — though this may be an error and maybe it should be 0.35 to
0.50) and less than 400 pA of dark current (though “typical” is 50
pA).  It costs US$22.  (Advanced Photonix, Excelitas, ON
Semiconductor, and Opto Diode are four other vendors.)</p>
<p>These currents are fairly small, which is why people often use
phototransistors instead.</p>
<h2>Possible camera designs</h2>
<h3>Matrix focal plane</h3>
<p>But at the 2-nanosecond prices you could quite reasonably put together
a 16x16 focal plane of fast photodiodes and get a 256-pixel image at
500 million frames per second, although it's challenging to amplify
and digitize the data that fast, and your RF signal integrity design
needs to be high-quality, with carefully matched stripline or
something.</p>
<h3>Pushbroom focal planes</h3>
<p>Maybe more interesting, you could put your 256 photodiodes in a
<em>column</em> instead of a matrix, then scan them across the image
horizontally, for example using a spinning mirror like the kind used
in the Michelson-Morley measurements of the speed of light, in
supermarket scanners, and in laser printers.  Spinning at 30,000 rpm
like a Dremel tool, an eight-sided spinning mirror could scan 4000
times per second; perhaps a separate stationary mirror or two could
multiply that by 2 or 4.  Air bearings can manage perhaps three times
higher speeds than that.</p>
<p>(This is somewhat similar to the display outlined in <a href="../notes/mechano-optical-vector-display.html">A mechano-optical vector display for animation archival</a>, but backwards in time, with light
sensors in place of light sources.)</p>
<p>You do suffer a loss of light-gathering capacity, because unless your
camera is kilometers long, there's nowhere to store the light that
gets reflected to the left or right of the photodiode array; it just
gets lost.  Light-gathering capacity is extremely important at these
speeds.</p>
<p>However, note that this provides an only sort of mediocre frame rate,
but a sort of excessively horizontal resolution, limited by the mirror
speed: 500 million pixels per second per photodiode, divided by 4000
scans per second, gives you 125000 pixels horizontally, but still only
256 pixels vertically.  Something more like 512 pixels horizontally
and a million frames per second would be a much better compromise, but
you can’t spin a macroscopic mirror 500 times faster; it will explode,
as did Michelson and Morley’s mirror once.</p>
<p>Maybe a bunch of stationary mirrors, or more facets on the spinning
mirror, can increase the number of horizontal scans per second, at the
expense of a very narrow field of view.  But maybe you start running
into diffraction problems with mirror edges.</p>
<h3>Staggered pushbrooms</h3>
<p>If there’s no diffraction problem with mirror edges, though, there’s
an alternative to sacrificing field of view.  You increase the number
of mirror facets as before, but you organize the photodiodes in
several rows, as in the mirrorless 16x16 matrix --- but this time with
a large empty horizontal space between columns, such that the narrow
fields of view of the various columns, produced by the spinning
mirror, nearly overlap, giving you back a wider field of view.</p>
<p>Is there in fact a diffraction problem?  If we want our mirror facets
to be at least 7 microns wide, we can fit almost 4500 of them around
the circumference of a 10-mm-diameter mirror; this could give you a
bit over 2 million scans per second.</p>
<h3>Smaller and nutating mirrors</h3>
<p>A smaller-radius mirror can rotate faster before exploding — the
cross-section holding it together diminishes at least proportional to
the radius, but the acceleration diminishes proportional to the
radius, and the mass diminishes jointly inversely proportional to the
radius and to the cross-section, so you gain a factor of the radius.
However, submillimeter-scale things in sliding contact tend to stick
together (think of compacting dry, clayey dirt between your fingers)
and also wear quickly.  So it might be worth using a flexing solid
object rather than sliding-contact parts.</p>
<p>(What about lubrication?  Lubrication with a film of a Newtonian fluid
of a given viscosity creates a frictional force proportional to the
movement speed and contact area, but inversely proportional to the
film thickness.  So if we scale down an oil-film-lubricated joint 10×
in every spatial dimension, including its movement speed, it seems
like we win: 100× less surface area and 10× less movement speed gives
1000× less friction, and the 10× thinner film thickness cuts that to
100×.  Maybe lubrication could work?)</p>
<p>Even a macroscopic mirror can vibrate at higher than 500 Hz, although
generally not over a very wide range of angles.  Music-box comb tines
can vibrate (resonantly!) at 1kHz or so with lengths on the order of
10 mm.  If you scale one down by a linear factor of 10 you diminish
its mass by 1000 and each part of the cross section of the elastic
beam by a factor of 100 (see <a href="../notes/gold-leaf-trusses.html">Gold leaf trusses</a>).  If the tine
is curved with a radius of curvature scaled down by the same 10, then
the strain near its upper and lower surfaces will be the same as the
original tine, and so will the stress, but by acting over a 100×
smaller cross-sectional area, it will exert a 100× smaller force.
This force is acting over a 10× smaller lever arm to the neutral axis
of the beam, thus generating a 1000× smaller moment, but the beam
length is also 10× smaller, so this results in a 100× smaller force on
the weight at the end of the tine, and thus a 10× greater acceleration
at the same relative tine curvature.</p>
<p>This greater acceleration, in turn, would, by itself, raise the
resonant frequency of oscillation by √10 ≈ 3.16, but the amplitude of
oscillation (measured in meters) is also diminished by a factor of 10,
which raises the frequency by another √10.  So the micro-music-box
tine might vibrate at 10 kHz rather than 1 kHz.  And if we scale it
down by 100× instead of 10× we get 100 kHz.</p>
<p>But a music-box tine is far from the fastest-vibrating piece of metal
of its scale; rather, it’s designed to have very low rigidity so that
its Q will be high, its amplitude of vibration will be large, and its
frequency will be <em>lower</em>.  A <em>serrucho</em> or musical saw can resonate,
when bowed or plucked, at the same frequency as a music-box tine, but
the saw is perhaps 700 mm long and 200 mm wide, about a hundred times
larger.  So it might be possible to get microscopic mirrors to nutate
up into the megahertz.</p>
<h3>Alternative camera scanning mechanisms</h3>
<p>Perhaps instead of a spinning mirror you could use an electro-optical
Kerr cell or Pockels cell with a voltage gradient from one side of it
to the other, thus obtaining much quicker response times but smaller
deflection angles.  Alternatively you could physically move a mirror
with a piezoelectric stack actuator like those used for
adaptive-optics telescopes; many of these actuators have reasonable
response at frequencies up into the megahertz, so sinusoidally
scanning a mirror over a small angle at such frequencies should be
feasible.</p>
<h3>Scanned illumination</h3>
<p>As an alternative to scanning the photodiodes’ viewpoint across the
scene being photographed, you could scan a laser or focused LED across
the scene instead, as in <a href="../notes/flying-spot-reilluminatable-stage.html">Flying spot reilluminatable stage</a>.
You could do this with just a single photodiode and a full scanning
raster pattern, as suggested in that note, or you could sweep a short
vertical line of light horizontally across the scene and locate the
column of photodiodes on a one-dimensional focal plane.  You might be
able to design an asymmetric lens with a normal focusing,
imaging-optics shape in the Y dimension, but a
compound-parabolic-collector or similar wide-angle non-imaging optics
light-gathering shape in the X direction, to somewhat ameliorate the
light-gathering problems of the pure-pushbroom configuration.</p>
<h4>Switching between illumination sources</h4>
<p>This configuration has much the same X-Y imbalance problem as the
pushbroom: if your laser is scanned at only 4000 Hz, you get 125000
pixels in X and only 256 pixels in Y.  But common lasers and
low-brightness LEDs have switching times measured in nanoseconds.
Suppose that the illumination pattern of the vertical line produced by
the optics in front of the laser is spatially intermittent, with 256
small dots, one in the field of view of one photodiode.  Now if you
alternately illuminate those optics with two different lasers, one a
bit below the other, the dots will be displaced a small amount
vertically, but perhaps without moving from the field of view of one
photodiode to another.  This means that each photodiode is being
time-shared between two separate scan lines; most of the temporal
dimension of the signal corresponds to the X dimension, but a small
amount of it now corresponds to Y instead.</p>
<p>You can extend this to, say, 16 laser diodes, one above the other,
firing in sequence.  You still have only 4000 frames per second, but
now each frame consists of 4096 scan lines of some 7812 or 7813 pixels
each.  The overall laser firing pattern happens at 1.953'125 MHz, but
the waveform at each diode has important components up to 31.25 MHz.
This is well within the capabilities of most common laser diodes, but,
again, requires some attention to RFI.  (This time it’s a high-power
signal, tens of milliwatts rather than microwatts.)</p>
<p>Rather than dotting the vertical line projected by each laser, you
could make it short, and instead make the field of view of each
photodiode dotted, using faceted mirrors or a faceted lens.</p>
<h4>Switching between illumination directions</h4>
<p>Instead of illuminating the scene from a single spinning mirror or
other scanning device, illuminated alternatingly by light sources that
reflect onto slightly different parts of the scene, as above, you
could illuminate it alternatingly by scanning light sources at
different locations.  Instead of merely photography at a higher
vertical resolution, this provides near-simultaneous photography from
several different points of view.  If the light sources are all in a
horizontal line, this effect should be fairly pure, but if they are in
some other arrangement, the Y parallax will be out of sync, since the
Y dimension comes entirely from the sensor array.</p>
<h2>Time-domain sparkle sensors</h2>
<p>However, for applications like those described in <a href="../notes/starfield-servo.html">Starfield servo</a>, the 16×16 matrix could be very useful — not for
motion video made of frames, but for measuring with high precision and
low latency the times at which each sparkle begins to impinge on each
camera pixel.  This should provide nanosecond-level-precise times when
the movement being tracked crossed one or another threshold, and thus
allows the measurement of smooth movements with high spatial
precision, despite the small number of pixels.</p>
<p>And at these speeds, even fairly quick movements will be smooth: if
you are detecting the crossing of a 1-μm-wide threshold with a
time-domain resolution of 2 ns, your spatial precision doesn’t start
to suffer until the motion is faster than 1 μm/2 ns, which is 500 m/s.</p>
<p>The timing resolution is high enough that you may need to compensate
for the light travel time to the camera; 2 ns is 600 mm in air or
vacuum.</p>
<h2>Balanced flip-flops</h2>
<p>Since we’re talking about such small, high-frequency signals (-20 to
-40 dBm at 500 MHz, so, femtojoule scale, on the order of tens of
thousands of electrons, or less at low light levels) it might be
desirable to rig up some kind of robust amplification physically on
the focal plane, like the humans’ retinas do.  One possible way to do
this is with the goofy differential-amplifier scheme DRAM uses (see
<a href="../notes/snap-logic.html">Snap logic</a>): an RS latch with a short in the middle, biasing it
permanently to its metastable point.  When the short is removed (it’s
really a transistor!), the latch can settle to either the R or S
state, and even a small amount of charge on its R and S inputs can
determine which way it goes.  It’s a sort of clocked latching
differential amplifier.</p>
<p>In DRAM that charge comes from a just-discharged capacitor that held a
bit, but in this case it would come from the light current of a
reverse-biased photodiode — from the delta in voltage from the time
that both photodiodes’ capacitance had been initially charged.</p>
<p>This would allow you to amplify the <em>difference</em> between adjacent
photodiodes, rather than a single photodiode signal, and generate a
binary output from it.  By using the history of past outputs, we can
adjust the bias in the original photodiode charge levels to cancel out
any DC bias and give us a sigma-delta bitstream of the
high-pass-filtered difference signal between the two photodiodes,
using a mechanism analogous to neural habituation.  This leaves you
with a bitstream with no trace remaining of the absolute levels of
light or variations in gains and offsets among sensor pixels, only
detected edge movements over time.  The humans seem to do okay with
not much more than this.</p>
<p>(Such a circuit might be useful for applications other than fast
photodiode amplification, too.)</p>
<p>In particular, two such photodiode pairs that overlap by one
photodiode can distinguish the direction of movement of a shadow
boundary if it’s slow enough.  Something like this is the principle of
operation of the coded-tape and coded-wheel shaft encoders commonly
used in laser and inkjet printers.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
