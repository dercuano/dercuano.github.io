(4 minutes)</div><p>From at least the 1970s until the present day, semiconductor RAM has
been the dominant form of memory measured in number of memory
accesses, and the number of bytes of memory on an interactive computer
has roughly equaled the number of instructions per second it could
execute, from about a hundred thousand around 1980, to about a million
a few years later, to about ten million in the early 1990s, to about a
hundred million in the late 1990s, to about a billion in the early
2000s, to about ten billion today.</p>
<p>But in theory time-space tradeoffs are possible, and indeed we have
been achieving reasonable performance on these machines by storing a
lot of precomputed results in their memory.</p>
<p>But current microcontrollers have dramatically more computational
power than they have onboard memory, and adding off-chip memory
dramatically increases power usage.  It’s entirely typical to find a
CPU capable of 50 or 100 million 32-bit integer instructions per
second, but limited to 16 or 32 kilobytes of SRAM, a ratio of about
2000 instructions per byte.</p>
<p>The extreme on this axis, in a sense, is GreenArrays; each of the 144
cores on a GreenArrays chip executes about a billion 18-bit integer
instructions per second, but only has 64 18-bit words of memory, which
would be 144 bytes.  That’s about 7 million instructions per byte.  I
say “in a sense” because, with that little memory, it’s really kind of
in between being an FPGA and being a regular computer.</p>
<p>If nowadays CPU cycles are cheap compared to memory, how should we
adapt our software to that?  Maybe we can do more stuff with
convolutional and recurrent neural networks, but how about regular
things like graphical user interfaces?</p>
<p>You could imagine raytracing your GUI.  Raytracers use almost no
memory for intermediate rendering results, although they do usually
build up a scene graph.  I just ran a quick raytracer I’d written to
benchmark, generating 1920×1080 pixels, and got these results:</p>

<p>So that took 1.348 billion instructions, about 650 instructions per
output pixel.  It missed in its level-1 data cache (which is 128 KiB)
21,360 times; its cache lines are 64 bytes, so that totals about 1.37
megabytes of data I/O, about 10% of which was output.</p>
<p>Suppose this 650 instructions per pixel is typical (although I was
raytracing a very simple scene, you could imagine getting close to
this performance on general scenes using all kinds of clever hacks).
Then you could paint a 320×240 screen in 50 million instructions; with
ten or twenty small processors you could raytrace a small-screen UI.</p>
<p>However, 2560×1440 tablets are becoming common now!  These would
require 2.4 billion instructions per frame at that rate.</p>
<p>So, maybe not for a while yet.  The trends seem clear.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (138 notes)
