(2 minutes)</div><p>I was watching some 3Blue1Brown videos and came across one about the
Fourier transform which illustrated by drawing arbitrary pictures as
complex functions with, I think, a constant pen velocity.  The complex
Fourier transform amounts to representing the function as a sum of
rotating phasors, so the dude just drew the phasors; their magnitudes
and initial phase wholly determine the image and the pen speed.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that some kind of mechanism vaguely like this could
be used for cutting arbitrary toolpaths, like rosette "machine
turning".  To keep it balanced, you'd want each phasor to be not a
single arm rotating around one end, but a bar rotating around its
center, with a big enough counterweight at the other end to
counterbalance the whole assembly of succeeding phasors at its
business end.  This quickly gets into exponential growth so you don't
want to have too many levels of phasor.</p>
<p>Probably, though, in a physical machine, you will want to vary not the
radius of each rotation but its speed, since that's what you control
more directly.  This poses an interesting optimization problem of how
to trace some desired toolpath using such a balanced kinetic chain
with fixed radii by setting the rotations to specific speeds.</p>
<p>You can get twice as many degrees of freedom by moving the workpiece
as well as the tool, but this involves carefully adjusting the
counterweights to match the workpiece's mass.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/manufacturing.html">Manufacturing</a> (50 notes)
