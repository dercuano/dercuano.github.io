<p>Entry-C is a Golang- and SIMULA-67-inspired design for adding
object-orientation to C in a backwards-compatible fashion, unlike C++,
while adding only a small amount of extra syntax.  As with C++, it
doesn’t require garbage collection, it can be used to write
allocation-free programs to ensure constant space usage, and only the
language facilities you use will cost you anything at run-time.
However, it is more flexible and potentially more efficient than C++.</p>
<p>Semantic overloading of existing language features can make it harder
to report compiler errors usefully, because it increases the space of
valid programs.</p>
<h2>The mysterious <code>entry</code> keyword explained</h2>
<p>The C language has a set of reserved words that cannot be used for
identifiers (such as names for variables, fields, or types), such as
<code>struct</code> and <code>if</code>, which are generally used as syntactic elements of
the language.  Among these, we find the curiosity <code>entry</code>, which is
not used for anything; it’s simply illegal in valid C programs, like
a stray <code>@</code> or <code>`</code>.</p>
<p>Presumably this was intended for defining functions with multiple
entry points, which is an easy enough thing to do in assembly.  For
example, maybe you’d like to make an argument optional:</p>
<pre><code>printf:  push $stdin
fprintf: ...
</code></pre>
<p>In general, multiple entry points give you a way to make a tail call
to another function at a cost of zero instructions in code space and
zero execution time.  Here’s an example tail call from
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/netbook-misc-devel/nand.c">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/netbook-misc-devel/nand.c</a>:</p>
<pre><code>int inputs_for_pattern(char *pattern) {
  char *s;

  for (s = pattern; *s; s++)
    if ((*s != '0') &amp;&amp; (*s != '1') &amp;&amp; (*s != 'x')) return 0;
  return log2_int(s - pattern);
}

int log2_int(int n) {
  int rv = 0;
  while (n &gt; 1) {
    if (n &amp; 1) return 0;        /* lousy error reporting, but whatever */
    rv++;
    n &gt;&gt;= 1;
  }
  return rv;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Presumably what the <code>entry</code> keyword was contemplated for was being
able to write the above code more like this:</p>
<pre><code>int inputs_for_pattern(pattern)
char *pattern;
{
  char *s;
  int n;

  for (s = pattern; *s; s++)
    if ((*s != '0') &amp;&amp; (*s != '1') &amp;&amp; (*s != 'x')) return 0;
  n = s - pattern;

  entry int log2_int(n);

  int rv = 0;
  while (n &gt; 1) {
    if (n &amp; 1) return 0;        /* lousy error reporting, but whatever */
    rv++;
    n &gt;&gt;= 1;
  }
  return rv;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you remove the <code>entry</code> statement in the middle, this is valid C
already; but presumably the idea of the <code>entry</code> statement is that you
could, in a sense, enter in the middle of the function; the tail end
of the function is a function in its own right.</p>
<p>This is a relatively minor micro-optimization in most contexts, and
error-prone; and making the compiler smart enough that it’s actually a
win is kind of hard.</p>
<h2>Activation-record objects: unifying structs with functions</h2>
<p>SIMULA 67's big insight was that, in a way, a function call has a lot
in common with an object.  It has a set of variables and some code to
run with access to those variables.  The difference is that a function
call has very strict sequencing constraints: first the space for the
variables is allocated (and some of the variables are initialized),
then the code is executed, and when it returns, the space is
deallocated.  A C++ object is, in some sense, the union of the
features of a struct and a function call.</p>
<h3>Nesting constructor code</h3>
<p>Suppose we simply relax this constraint and blur the distinction
between structs and functions.  Then, instead of writing this code
(adapted from
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/inexorable-misc/simpleproxy.c">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/inexorable-misc/simpleproxy.c</a>):</p>
<pre><code>struct pipe {
    struct pipe *next;
    struct pipe *partner;
    struct bufferevent *buf;
    int marked_for_deletion;
    int fd;
    char *error;
};

static struct pipe *
new_pipe(int fd)
{
    struct pipe *p = malloc(sizeof(*p));
    if (!p) {
        log_msg("malloc failed (%s)", strerror(errno));
        return NULL;
    }

    p-&gt;next = NULL;
    p-&gt;marked_for_deletion = 0;
    p-&gt;fd = fd;
    p-&gt;error = NULL;

    p-&gt;buf = bufferevent_new(fd, read_callback, NULL, error_callback, p);
    if (!p-&gt;buf) {
       p-&gt;error = "bufferevent_new failed";
       return NULL;
    }

    if (-1 == bufferevent_enable(p-&gt;buf, EV_READ | EV_WRITE)) {
        p-&gt;err = "bufferevent_enable failed";
        bufferevent_free(p-&gt;buf);
        return NULL;
    }

    return p;
}

static void
error_callback(struct bufferevent *bufev, short what, void *arg)
{
    struct pipe *p = arg;
    log_msg("error %d on conn %d", what, p-&gt;fd);
    mark_for_deletion(p);
}
</code></pre>
<p>we could write</p>
<pre><code>struct pipe(int fd)
{
    struct pipe *next = NULL;
    struct pipe *partner;
    char *error = NULL;
    int marked_for_deletion = 0;
    struct bufferevent *buf = bufferevent_new(fd, read_callback, NULL,
                                              error_callback, &amp;fd);
    if (!buf) {
        error = "bufferevent_new failed";
    } else if (-1 == bufferevent_enable(buf, EV_READ | EV_WRITE)) {
        error = "bufferevent_enable failed";
        bufferevent_free(buf);
        buf = NULL;
    }
};

static void
error_callback(struct bufferevent *bufev, short what, void *arg)
{
    struct pipe *p = arg;
    log_msg("error %d on conn %d", what, p-&gt;fd);
    mark_for_deletion(p);
}

static void
mark_for_deletion(struct pipe *p)
{
    /* ... */
}
</code></pre>
<p>This puts the initialization code for the struct inside the struct
itself, leaving the allocation or deallocation up to the caller.  It’s
clearly a win in terms of avoiding code duplication, but it has a few
drawbacks.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have a convenient way to report initialization errors,
since it doesn’t have a return value, and it also doesn’t have
convenient syntax like C++’s <code>this</code> to take the address of the object
it’s initializing, for use in registering the callback
<code>error_callback</code> with libevent.  Instead, it type-puns a pointer to
the first parameter, which is implicitly stored in the struct, into a
pointer to the struct as a whole — which will break with no compiler
warnings if someone inserts a new parameter before <code>fd</code>.</p>
<h3>Pointers to nested functions with trampolines</h3>
<p>GCC implements Pascal-like nested functions, with access to the outer
function’s stack frame, using a small amount of runtime code
generation, putting a small trampoline that pushes a pointer to the
stack frame and then jumps to the function, into the stack frame
itself.  If we use that feature, we could simplify the above to the
following:</p>
<pre><code>struct pipe(int fd) {
    struct pipe *next = NULL;
    struct pipe *partner;
    char *error = NULL;
    int marked_for_deletion = 0;

    void error_callback(struct bufferevent *bufev, short what, void *arg)
    {
        log_msg("error %d on conn %d", what, fd);
        mark_for_deletion();
    }

    void mark_for_deletion()
    {
        /* ... */
    }

    struct bufferevent *buf = bufferevent_new(fd, read_callback, NULL,
                                              error_callback, NULL);
    if (!buf) {
        error = "bufferevent_new failed";
    } else if (-1 == bufferevent_enable(buf, EV_READ | EV_WRITE)) {
        error = "bufferevent_enable failed";
        bufferevent_free(buf);
        buf = NULL;
    }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>error_callback</code> no longer needs an explicit pointer passed in,
and indeed if libevent were written to require you to use runtime code
generation to use basic functionality, <code>bufferevent_new</code> could take
three parameters instead of five.  This expands <code>struct pipe</code>’s space
by the space needed to hold the trampolines.</p>
<p>GCC’s regular nested function support generates functions that are
only safely callable until the outer function returns, because both
the outer function variables and the trampoline itself are stored on
the stack.  This design avoids that restriction, because the
trampoline can be stored within the struct itself.</p>
<h3>Invoking nested functions without trampolines</h3>
<p>The only reason for the trampolines, though, is that we’re converting
nested-function pointers into regular function pointers, and then,
instead of calling them immediately, we are passing them to a function
that takes regular function pointers as parameters.  The call to
<code>mark_for_deletion</code> in the above code needs no such trampoline;
neither does a call such as the following:</p>
<pre><code>void invoke_error(struct pipe *p) {
    p-&gt;error_callback(NULL, 37, NULL);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The underlying <code>error_callback</code> function takes an extra hidden
parameter that is a <code>struct pipe *</code>, and in this case we’re passing
that parameter explicitly.</p>
<p>If we adopt a rule that only code lexically within the struct
declaration is permitted to convert nested-function pointers to
regular C function pointers, then we can statically compute the set of
nested functions that need trampolines generated for them, which will
usually be empty.</p>
<h3>Initializing objects</h3>
<p>Normally you can initialize a statically-allocated or stack-allocated
struct with an initializer list (from
<a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/netbook-misc-devel/hanoitri.c">http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/netbook-misc-devel/hanoitri.c</a>:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct { int num, denom; } ratio;
static const ratio sin_60 = { 56755, 65535 };
</code></pre>
<p>It makes sense that you’d repurpose that same syntax to supply
initializer arguments to struct types like <code>pipe</code> above that have
declared constructor arguments.  Also, as in C++, it seems convenient
to allow you to just say <code>= x;</code> rather than <code>= { x };</code> in the case
where there’s just one argument.</p>
<p>But what about dynamically-allocated objects on the heap, or in an
array or whatever?</p>
<p>I think the most harmonious approach is to define an additional
coercion rule from lvalues that are structs with constructors, or
pointers to structs with constructors, to function pointers.  If you
invoke such an lvalue as if it were a function, then it decays to a
pointer to the constructor code, which has a void return value.</p>
<p>Thus, this will initialize element 5 of the array of pipes with the
<code>fd</code> argument <code>fd0</code>, and element 6 with <code>fd1</code>, and give a compile
error about a missing constructor argument on element 7:</p>
<pre><code>struct pipe pipes[10];
pipes[5](fd0);
struct pipe *p = &amp;pipes[6];
p(fd1);
pipes[7]();
</code></pre>
<p>The following will also give a compile error, because you’re trying to
invoke a constructor on a <code>struct pipe</code> rvalue, which is generally a
useless thing to do:</p>
<pre><code>struct pipe pipes[10];
struct pipe f() { return pipes[5]; }
f()(fd0);
</code></pre>
<p>This seems compatible with considering structs and functions merely
slightly different versions of the same thing.</p>
<h3>Temporary objects</h3>
<p>In C++, if you have a <code>Rational</code> class, you can say</p>
<pre><code>Rational seven_sixths = Rational(2, 3) + Rational(1, 2);
</code></pre>
<p>which (given the existence of the relevant constructors and overloads)
constructs two or three temporary <code>Rational</code> objects and then destroys
them (you might say “on the stack”, although of course that’s just one
possible implementation).  This is pretty handy, but the rules about
the lifetimes of those objects are very tricky, and the syntax creates
a conflict between the namespace of classes and the namespace of
functions and variables.  The interaction of this feature in C++ with
the absence of sequence points between the constructors created a bug
in most C++ programs where one constructor may be partly complete when
the other throws an exception.</p>
<p>So, for the moment, I’m not adding temporary objects to Entry-C.</p>
<h2>Ad-hoc polymorphism with dynamic dispatch with Golang-like interfaces</h2>
<p>I’ve been claiming Entry-C was a “backwards-compatible object-oriented
C”, but so far all I’ve given is a way to avoid writing a separate
initialization function for your structs and a little syntactic sugar
to define functions that operates on them more conveniently.
Object-orientation is usually described as consisting of
encapsulation, (ad hoc) polymorphism, and inheritance,
[and something else?] none of which have made an appearance so
far. Also, I haven’t used the <code>entry</code> keyboard I spent so many bytes
bloviating about at the beginning.</p>
<p>So let’s steal Golang’s approach to polymorphism wholesale.  Golang
uses these things called interfaces to get polymorphism.  Golang
interfaces at runtime are basically three-tuples: a pointer to an
object, a pointer to a vtable, and a pointer to the underlying type of
the object for the sake of further interface conversions.  Any method
can be invoked polymorphically, via an interface, or monomorphically,
via some concrete type; and you can attempt to convert anything to any
interface type.  Conversions from a concrete type to an interface type
use a vtable for that interface type computed at compile time, and
give a compile-time error if that conversion is impossible.
Conversions from one interface type to another use a vtable generated
at runtime, and if the new interface type is not simply a subset of
the old one, they can yield a runtime error.</p>
<p>We can add the same mechanism to C by using the <code>entry</code> keyword for a
totally unintended purpose — declaring an interface type, with a
syntax exactly analogous to <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code>:</p>
<pre><code>entry callback_handler {
    void error_callback(struct bufferevent *, short, void *);
    void read_callback(struct bufferevent *, void *);
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can cast a <code>struct pipe</code> to an <code>entry callback_handler</code>, which
will use a pointer to a compile-time-generated vtable, as with Golang;
and we can also attempt to cast an <code>entry {}</code> to an <code>entry
callback_handler</code>, which may succeed (constructing a new vtable at
runtime, or finding a cached one) or may fail.</p>
<p>And that’s polymorphism in Entry-C: both more efficient and more
flexible than in C++.  It’s more efficient because you only use
polymorphism where it’s needed; it’s more flexible because the caller,
not the callee, decides when polymorphism is needed.</p>
<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
<p>Encapsulation might be a good idea, but Entry-C doesn’t have it, or
even a good way to approximate it.</p>
<p>You can make some of your methods “private” by declaring them
<code>static</code>, which will also keep them from being called polymorphically
via an <code>entry</code>.  But usually the things you would most like to make
private are variables, and you can’t make variables private by
declaring them <code>static</code>, because static variables are something else.</p>
<p>The best you can do is only a little better than in standard C: you
can put an <code>entry</code> type in your .h file and keep the actual
implementation type inside your .c file.  Then, because the callers
can’t allocate space for your implementation type, you probably need
to provide a function to allocate new instances of it and return
<code>entry</code>s to them, and a function (perhaps in the <code>entry</code>) to
deallocate instances.</p>
<p>This is better than the “pimpl” idiom in standard C or C++ because it
doesn’t have that disgusting name.</p>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Traditional inheritance is a terrible idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subtyping gives rise to questions of covariance and contravariance,
  which make your programming language an unnecessarily confusing user
  interface.  </li>
<li>The possibility of inheritance typically makes every variable
  run-time polymorphic, which makes reading the code more challenging.
  As a consequence, things that ought to be compile-time errors
  (e.g. casting from a type that doesn’t define <code>foo()</code> to an
  interface that requires it) become runtime errors (because some
  subclass might define <code>foo()</code>).  Also, things that ought to be
  trivially easy for the compiler to optimize become difficult.  You
  can’t inline a callee if you don’t know which callee is going to be
  called.</li>
<li>Classes that are not designed to be subclassed often can’t be
  subclassed to do what you want, although the language won’t stop you
  from trying.</li>
<li>Classes that <em>are</em> designed to be subclassed have no way in the
  language to define the interface between themselves and their
  subclasses, and it’s very common for new versions of library classes
  to break existing subclasses; for example, it’s trivially easy to
  accidentally get recursion this way, creating the danger of not just
  infinite recursive loops but also problems with re-entrancy.</li>
<li>Everything that you can do with inheritance, you can do better with
  delegation.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Entry-C doesn’t have traditional inheritance.</p>
<p>However, as in Plan 9 C and consequently as in Golang, you can import
the names defined in a nested struct into your own namespace by simply
not naming the struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct pipe;
</code></pre>
<p>The names in the inner anonymous struct (both inner functions and data
fields) will be visible wherever your own names would be visible.  If
you define conflicting names, that’s a compile error.  This enables
you to share implementations of certain methods across multiple
classes in a convenient way, without the problems introduced by
standard inheritance, but it’s purely syntactic sugar for a bunch of
one-line delegation methods.  The “inherited” methods can’t implicitly
call methods you define.</p>
<p>At file scope, this allows you to incrementally refactor from global
data to local data; you can start by collecting the global data into
an anonymous struct, then move functions into it one or a few at a
time.</p>
<h2>Error reporting</h2>
<p>There’s a big problem with error reporting in C, and adding
constructors to structs just makes it worse, because you might want to
do things in a constructor that could fail, and as in C++, the
constructor doesn’t really have a way to return that failure value.
This is, I think, why Golang doesn’t have constructors.</p>
<p>The standard C++ answer is to use exceptions, but exceptions have
their own problems, especially in the absence of garbage collection
and in the presence of the kind of things that make code
non-reentrant.</p>
<p>The Golang answer is to use multiple return values for everything that
might fail.  Entry-C doesn’t have multiple return values, although
clearly C should have had them.</p>
<p>The standard C answer is for your initializer function to either take
the address of the struct as an argument and return an int, or to
return the address of a newly allocated struct or NULL.  Entry-C
constructors don’t have return values.</p>
<p>You can do what I did in the example above: define an “error” field in
the object, indicating whether construction failed.  Alternatively,
you can move things that could fail out of the constructor, and return
a success or failure code:</p>
<pre><code>struct pipe() {
    struct pipe *next = NULL;
    struct pipe *partner;
    struct bufferevent *buf = NULL;
    int fd;
    int marked_for_deletion = 0;

    void error_callback(struct bufferevent *bufev, short what, void *arg) {
        log_msg("error %d on conn %d", what, fd);
        mark_for_deletion();
    }

    void mark_for_deletion() {
        /* ... */
    }

    char *open(int new_fd) {
        fd = new_fd;
        buf = bufferevent_new(fd, read_callback, NULL,
                              error_callback, NULL);
        if (!buf) {
            return "bufferevent_new failed";
        }

        if (-1 == bufferevent_enable(buf, EV_READ | EV_WRITE)) {
            bufferevent_free(buf);
            buf = NULL;
            return "bufferevent_enable failed";
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};
</code></pre>
<p>However, Entry-C also adds a new kind of error condition: casting one
entry type to another that isn’t a superset could produce a runtime
error.  XXX I need a design for how to handle that operation and the
resulting error.</p>
<h2>Function overloading</h2>
<p>No.  <em>Fuck</em> no.</p>
<h2>Operator overloading</h2>
<p>This might be a good idea, especially for arithmetic.  I’m not sure
how to do it, especially without constructing temporary objects or
throwing exceptions.</p>
<h2>Example: integer DSP pipelines set up at runtime</h2>
<p>Here we have a bunch of DSP filters that can be connected to each
other at runtime, including a software phase-locked loop, using no
heap allocation and no casts.  The final paragraph sets up an example.</p>

<p>A “crad” is a made-up unit of angular measure designed to avoid
multiplication and division in the main loop of the PLL algorithm.
(You could argue that it’s at least as bad to do polymorphic method
dispatch, but probably only if you’re on a computer so big that memory
references are slower than division.)</p>

<p>Nothing surprising so far, except maybe that I didn’t make a <code>typedef</code>
for <code>entry value</code>.  Now let’s amp up the weird with a lazy mapcar:</p>
<pre><code>struct mapcar *mapcar(entry value *f(entry value), entry value items) {
    struct mapcar *rv = allocate(sizeof(*rv));
    rv(f, items);
    return rv;
}

struct mapcar(entry value *f(entry value), entry value items) {
    entry value car() { return f(items.car()); }
    entry value cdr() { return mapcar(f, items.cdr()); }
    int is_null() { return items.is_null(); }
    struct symbol *as_symbol() { return items.as_symbol(); }
    void visit(entry collector gc) { gc.found(&amp;f); gc.visit(items); }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Heap-allocation here is necessary because the caller of <code>cdr()</code>
doesn’t know they’re receiving a <code>struct mapcar</code>; the declared return
type of <code>cdr()</code> is just <code>entry value</code>.  Consequently, they can’t
allocate space for a <code>struct mapcar</code> return value; so, that needs to
be allocated on the heap.  That’s one reason this needs garbage
collection, but of course Lisp in general kind of needs it.</p>
<p>This is the kind of situation where “virtual destructors”, which is to
say a run-time polymorphic method to recursively deallocate child
resources, are helpful, although in this particular case they aren’t
enough, because some objects in the object graph may be referenced
more than once.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
