(2 minutes)</div><p>One of the fun things about writing graphics code is that you get
better bugs.  In normal programming, bugs are mostly frustrating: they
get in your way, make things harder, corrupt data you painstakingly
created, or crash the program and interrupt what you're doing.  But a
lot of bugs in graphics code either look really cool or have no real
visible effect.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm not writing graphics code.  I'm writing an
almost-Scheme compiler in itself.  But I just created a really bizarre
bug.</p>
<p>Here's a little bit of the assembly output from the compiler:</p>
<pre><code>epacse__4:
        # compute desired %esp on return in %ebx and push it
        lea 4(%esp,%edx,4), %ebx
...
        movl (htgnel_gnirts__2), %eax
</code></pre>
<p>Where did <code>htgnel_gnirts__2</code> come from?  Well, it's <code>_string_length</code>
spelled backwards, followed by <code>_2</code>.  And <code>epacse</code> is <code>escape</code> spelled
backwards.  I accidentally created a bug that <em>spells names
backwards</em>.  That's almost as funny as some of my graphics-code bugs.</p>
<p>How this happened requires a little bit of explanation.  In Scheme, as
in most Lisps, adding items to the beginning of a list is fast and
safe, but adding onto the end of a list is either slow and bug-prone,
safe but extremely slow, or very verbose and therefore bug-prone and
hard to maintain.  But reversing a list is relatively fast.  So I
wrote a function that looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>(define (stringlist-&gt;string stringlist) 
  (list-&gt;string (reverse (stringlist-&gt;string-2 stringlist 0))))
</code></pre>
<p>Because I thought stringlist-&gt;string-2 was going to have to build up a
list of all the characters <em>backwards</em>, and then I was going to have
to reverse it.</p>
<p>When stringlist-&gt;string-2 turned out to be able to build up the list
of characters in the right order --- by adding them backwards --- I
forgot to take out the <code>reverse</code>.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
