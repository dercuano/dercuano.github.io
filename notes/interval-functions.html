(10 minutes)</div><p>The standard interval-arithmetic approximation is wonderful for
ensuring correctness, but it doesn’t work very well in regions where
the derivative is high.  Functions can be perfectly regular in the
analytic sense and still have an arbitrarily large derivative.  As a
result, if you are computing a function over an interval and you chop
the interval in half repeatedly, you may end up merely chopping the
function’s result in half repeatedly.  (Or not even that, if it has a
singularity.)</p>
<p>Can we do better?</p>
<p>As an alternative,
you might think
we could conservatively approximate the function’s
value over that interval x ∈ [a, b) with a triple (m, d, e) such that
x ∈ [a, b) ⇒ f(x) ∈ [mx + d, mx + e).  Just as with simple intervals,
there are many possible such triples that could be used; it may not be
immediately clear which is the best choice, but I think it’s the one
with the smallest e - d value.  (For a function given as an
enumeration of points, there is a usually efficient algorithm
beginning with its convex hull.)</p>
<p>The identity function on any interval is represented by (1, 0, 0); the
constant k, similarly, is (0, k, k).</p>
<p>Addition and subtraction of such values is fairly easy and reminiscent
of that with intervals.  Multiplication may or may not have a local
maximum which must be taken into account; division, as with interval
arithmetic, may or may not have a singularity, as well as perhaps
local maxima.</p>
<p>For a regular function, intuitively I expect that, when I divide a
small enough interval in half, its derivative should vary by half as
much over the interval, because on a small enough interval, its third
and higher derivatives create too little change to matter, so it looks
like a parabola.</p>
<p>I intuitively guess that the best approximation of a parabolic segment
(in the e - d sense) is tangent to the parabola at the midpoint of the
interval.  Adding a linear function doesn’t affect the e - d error, so
for analysis we can add a linear function that brings both endpoints
of the interval to the X-axis, with the midpoint horizontal.  Now if
we divide this into two sub-parabolas and do the same with them, their
second derivative is the same as the original, but with only half as
far to affect the parabola from the horizontal midpoint to the
endpoint, it can reach only a fourth as high.</p>
<p>Therefore, I intuitively expect this approach to quadruple its
accuracy when you chop an interval in half, so it will need half as
many evaluations to reach the same accuracy of some arbitrary regular
function as the simple interval-arithmetic method.  As a bonus, it
provides an approximation of the first derivative over that same
interval, but it is not a conservative approximation.</p>
<p>I intuitively expect this accuracy improvement to be crucially
important for a composition of functions, since it means that the
output of your approximation is in some sense more precise than its
input — so you might not suffer progressive degradation as you get
further from the input.</p>
<p>If you extended this approach to use a higher-order approximation than
linear, you could perhaps tighten the bounds further; but this isn’t
necessary in order to get the precision-improvement property mentioned
above.</p>
<p>When extended to multiple independent variables, this linear
approximation approach requires linear extra work per independent
variable; instead of a single variable m, you have a vector of
coefficients [m₀, m₁, ...mₙ], and the dot product of this vector with
the vector of independent variables [x₀, x₁, ...xₙ] gives you the
approximation correction.  Higher-order approximations would
necessarily involve sets of coefficients at least quadratic in the
number of independent variables.</p>
<p>Bisection methods potentially take time exponential in n in an
n-dimensional space.</p>
<h2>Arithmetic operations</h2>
<p>As I said before, the identity function i(x) = x is represented as
I = (1, 0, 0), and the constant function kₙ(x) = n is represented as
Kₙ = (0, n, n).  But where do we go from there?</p>
<p>Given</p>
<ul>
<li>x ∈ [a, b) ⇒ j(x) ∈ [mⱼx + dⱼ, mⱼx + eⱼ)  (J(a, b) = (mⱼ, dⱼ, eⱼ))</li>
<li>x ∈ [a, b) ⇒ k(x) ∈ [mₖx + dₖ, mₖx + eₖ)  (K(a, b) = (mₖ, dₖ, eₖ))</li>
</ul>
<p>Then what can we say about pointwise operations on these functions?</p>
<p>Addition is fairly simple.  Clearly j(x) + k(x) ∈ [(mⱼ + mₖ)x + dⱼ +
dₖ, (mⱼ + mₖ)x + eⱼ + eₖ), so (J + K)(a, b) = (mⱼ + mₖ, dⱼ + dₖ, eⱼ +
eₖ).</p>
<p>Subtraction is only slightly trickier; j(x) - k(x) ∈ [(mⱼ - mₖ)x +
dⱼ - eₖ, (mⱼ - mₖ)x + eⱼ - dₖ), so (J - K)(a, b) = (mⱼ - mₖ, dⱼ - eₖ,
eⱼ - dₖ).</p>
<p>Multiplication starts to get hairy.</p>
<p>The product j(x)k(x) is guaranteed to be in the interval</p>
<pre><code>[min((mⱼx + dⱼ)(mₖx + dₖ),
     (mⱼx + dⱼ)(mₖx + eₖ),
     (mⱼx + eⱼ)(mₖx + dₖ),
     (mⱼx + eⱼ)(mₖx + eₖ)), min((mⱼx + dⱼ)(mₖx + dₖ),
                                (mⱼx + dⱼ)(mₖx + eₖ),
                                (mⱼx + eⱼ)(mₖx + dₖ),
                                (mⱼx + eⱼ)(mₖx + eₖ)))
</code></pre>
<p>However, which of the four alternatives is the minimum and which is
the maximum might vary according to x.  The first one expands out to
mⱼmₖx² + (mⱼdₖ + mₖdⱼ)x + dⱼdₖ, which can clearly change sign twice
over some interval and possibly have a local maximum in the middle.</p>
<p>The quadratic term is the same across all four alternatives, but the
linear term varies, and the combination of those two means that the
location of the parabola’s extremum can vary between the four; each of
the four might be the minimum at some point in the interval!</p>
<p>In most cases, both j(x) and k(x) will have known sign on the
interval — they are known to be either positive everywhere in [a, b)
or negative everywhere in [a, b).  If <em>either</em> of them meets this
criterion, the solution is simple; if j(x) is known to be positive
(i.e. mⱼa + eⱼ &gt; 0 and mⱼa + dⱼ &gt; 0), then XXX</p>
<p>Hmm, the answer to this isn’t clear to me right now.</p>
<hr />
<p>Coming back later to rethink this:</p>
<p>So the idea is that you represent a value yᵢ computed for some
interval {x₀ ∈ [p₀, q0), x₁ ∈ [p₁, q₁), ... xₙ ∈ [pₙ, qₙ)} as some
function Σᵢxᵢmᵢ + [d, e) associated with that interval, where “[b, c)”
means “some unknown number e such that b ≤ e &lt; c”; the representation
of that value then is</p>
<pre><code>(d, e, [(m₀, p₀, q₀), (m₁, p₁, q₁), … (mₙ, pₙ, qₙ)])
</code></pre>
<p>Then, when values are valid over the same interval, we can do
relatively straightforward things for arithmetic operations, although
I haven’t worked out the details in cases of indeterminate signs for
multiplication and division.  When they are valid over different
intervals, we can intersect their ranges and apply a subdivision
operation.</p>
<p>In effect here what we are computing with are piecewise-linear
approximations of functions with error bounds per piece, rather than
individual intervals.</p>
<p>To take a concrete example, in raytracing, we have x₀ and x₁, the
pixel coordinates, and we want to compute colors (r, g, and b) as
functions of those two values.  An approximate solution here is
perfectly fine as long as the approximation isn’t too wildly wrong.
(And in fact common rendering algorithms are wildly wrong for some
pixels, the ones that are close to object boundaries.)  So we can
start with a conservative approximation for, for example,
x₀ ∈ [0, 1024) ∧ x₁ ∈ [0, 768) — we can calculate the ray directions
as intervals, calculate which objects could possibly be intersected by
those rays, and calculate what range of colors and illumination those
objects could potentially result in, eventually coming up with some
kind of conservative approximation for the color gradient of the whole
scene.</p>
<p>Once we have this conservative approximation for the scene as a whole,
we can compare its error bounds to the error bounds we want to accept
for our colors.  If it’s too large, we break up the interval into
subintervals and redo the computation for each subinterval.  In the
past, doing things like this, I found that dividing into three
subintervals was better than dividing into two.  Unfortunately the
representation gives us no clue as to which dimension is most
promising to subdivide.  In this case that is quadratically bad in
some cases, but with many dimensions it is exponentially bad.</p>
<p>While you’re doing the calculation, though, you have some idea how
much of the error comes from each independent variable.  If you could
somehow include that information, with something like forward-mode
automatic differentiation, you would have a much better chance of
choosing good subdivision dimensions to reduce the error.</p>
<p>However, if you have both many independent variables and many
dependent variables, this will be quadratically large.  One possible
solution to this problem is to redefine the indices of the dependent
variables as separate independent variables, as in the raytracing
example in which ultimately there are only three dependent variables,
r, g, and b.  This, I think, makes the <em>reverse-mode</em> automatic
differentiation problem computationally tractable, which should help
some with the problem of picking which dimension to subdivide.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (286 notes)
